This is a major issue for us, as it (1) causes frustration to users and sometimes outright prevents them from using the MVVM Toolkit, and (2) leads them to assume the MVVM Toolkit is at fault here, and then report issues in our repo, where there isn't really much we can do (and I suspect the issue is rather somewhere in Roslyn/VS).\r\n\r\nThe common symptoms are:\r\n- IntelliSense not working correctly (red squiggly lines all over the place for generated members)\r\n- Builds outright being broken with various source generator errors (common one being that they run twice)\r\n\r\nWe've noticed reports in several configurations, from MAUI to WinUI 3, etc. I have tried to reproduce this and so far I've just been completely unable to do so. This included setting up test projects on various frameworks and inspecting our unit tests. I genuinely have no idea what's going on and why things are breaking up for so many people, and could use some help 🥲\r\n\r\nRelated issues:\r\n- https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/dotnet/issues/493\r\n- https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/dotnet/issues/584\r\n- https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/dotnet/issues/598\r\n- https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/dotnet/issues/623\r\n- https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/dotnet/issues/625\r\n\r\n> **Note**: this seems unrelated to the previous issue caused by CsWin32 bundling `System.Memory` assemblies (which @jaredpar fixed in Roslyn, and the CsWin32 team also addressed on their end), as that was just causing the generators to completely fail to be loaded. This is different: they are loaded but then either result in IntelliSense being broken, or they throw errors, or they just seem to not run at all. I have been unable to find a setup/configuration that consistently reproduces the issue.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, several people seem to also report downgrading to 8.0 fixes the issue. The main difference I can see in 8.1 is that we're now using Roslyn multi-targeting. I wonder if there might be some bug in that area that causes Roslyn to sometimes trip up? Not saying this is 100% the cause of the issue, but in some cases it does seem downgrading solves it.\r\n\r\ncc. @333fred @sharwell @chsienki\r\n"},{"Id":"29793413478","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-06-15T22:40:40","Actor":"chsienki","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/68451","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Fix inserting new values with source generators\" (#68451) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"If an upstream node adds more items in the middle of its output, we would incorrectly use a later value as the cached value because the table offset was incorrect.

This message always showed, independent if the cert was actually installed or not. Additionally, the text specific to the cert provided a command only applicable to Windows and MacOS. I've separated the cert text out of the \"More Info\" section, and created 2 other resource strings; one for Windows/MacOS and one for Linux. I've updated the printing logic to only print the cert message when the cert is installed, and only print the correct message depending on the current OS.\r\n\r\n*Note*: There is 1 extra blank line now that the cert message is separated from the \"More Info\" message.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"702426498","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-16T06:07:11","Actor":"billvenhaus","Number":"1774","RawContent":null,"Title":"[UWP] HttpClientHandler - Digest Authentication Broken on Windows 10 PC","State":"closed","Body":"Just recently I found that my UWP app can no longer connect with Digest authentication on Windows 10 PCs.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption.

It should most likely be flagged on the definition of the identifier locally that has been given the same name the causes the resulting conflict later on in the program that is not the source of the underlying issue.\r\n\r\n> CS###: 'identifier' exists in both 'parent type/namespace' and as 'type' from 'namespace'.\r\n>\r\n> This warning occurs in a situation when an identifier has been defined, usually a member within the current scope, that is given the same name as an available type in the outer scope, which produces ambiguity.\r\n\r\nThese types of issues can be hard and time consuming to debug as other analyzers generally flag problems with the code later where it's trying to be used, like [CS0117](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/misc/cs0117), which points developers in the wrong direction where they focus on where they're trying to implement things and checking docs for types to ensure properties exist vs. that there's actually something else they've defined in their program which is disrupting their ability to use a type they're expecting.\r\n\r\nIt'd be much clearer to get a message above, akin to what happens with conflicting types in the same namespace ala [CS0433](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/cs0433) to help the developer realize there's a conflict.\r\n\r\n**Languages applicable:**\r\n\r\nProbably C# only, but not familiar enough with VB anymore to know if the same would apply.\r\n\r\n**Code example that the analyzer should report:**\r\n\r\nA small code snippet that describes a case that the analyzer should report.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n// Suppose you have an enum/type/class or something defined somewhere (or are using from a platform API or library)\r\npublic enum Orientation {\r\n    Horiztonal,\r\n    Vertical,\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Elsewhere you define a class that has a property with the same name as the type, in our case this was generated from a source generator so this issue was super not obvious looking at our code...\r\npublic partial class MyClass\r\n{\r\n    public string Orientation { get; set; } // New Analyzer would flag this line with the warning when used in a way that would be conflated with the type of the same name (see below)\r\n}\r\n\r\n// In that same class with the property defined, you try and use your type, as one would do... however, this doesn't work as the compiler is now confused by the local property defined as `Orientation` with a different type (string)... but there's no warning or analyzer to tell you that. Instead, you get things about static methods CS0120 or if you remove the 'static' from the method you get CS0117 instead...\r\npublic partial class MyClass\r\n{\r\n    public static Orientation ConvertStringToOrientation(string orientation) => orientation switch\r\n    {\r\n        \"Vertical\" => Orientation.Vertical,\r\n        \"Horizontal\" => Orientation.Horizontal,\r\n        _ => throw new System.NotImplementedException(),\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional information:**\r\n\r\n- This came up because we had a source generator generating are property with the same name as an enum type we were trying to use, but with a different type, `string`. It was not obvious that this was the issue at all with a naming conflict between the local identifier and our enum type in the parent scope we wanted to use. We were getting things like [CS0120](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/cs0120) related to the method and then if we made it not `static` a [CS0117](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/misc/cs0117) about `Horizontal` not being a property on `string`... which finally at least clued us into a bit more about what had happened.\r\n  \r\n  If the compiler just told us this though or warned us that something in the local scope was overriding the type definition, this would have saved us a good 15 minutes on a group call, let alone how much time the developer was confused with this beforehand as this was based on an existing example code sample that worked fine (just had a different generated property name).\r\n\r\n- These types of scenarios seem common and something that the compiler could help developers with to better understand when they have conflicting definitions under the same scope. See this decade old related [stack overflow post as well](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11379166/string-does-not-contain-a-definition-for).\r\n\r\n- This is related to other conflict messages like [CS0433](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/cs0433), [CS0434](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/misc/cs0434), [CS0438](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/misc/cs0438) which the compiler identifiers and helps easily inform the developer that there is an overloaded identifier in the current scope.\r\n\r\n**Open questions**\r\n\r\n- [ ] The [Framework Design Guidelines - Names of Type Members](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/names-of-type-members#names-of-properties) explicitly suggests that giving the property the same name as the type is OK. This is common in UI orientated classes. However, in this case the property name and type usually have the same name, generally these are enums and the compiler/VS seems better about suggesting and not conflicting the proper usage there. Therefore, this seems to be more of an issue when there are mismatching types between the property name and the type name? But not sure if that's a stead-fast distinction in all cases. \r\n\r\n  So, what is the appropriate frequency/test needed to determine if a case should be flagged as suppressing all properties in UI controls would be excessive... Can it be indicated if the compiler gets confused later when by usage, as in a UI class there's usually distinctions and this scenario developers face generally isn't an issue to the same degree...\r\n\r\n- [ ] In our scenario, the issue came from a generated property. Normally some of those analyzers get suppressed, right? Though in this case it'd be more important to notify the developer about it? So not sure how that would get resolved... As it's not a figment of how the code was generated but instead the impact it has on your other code the developer is writing...\r\n\r\n\r\n**Documentation requirements:**\r\n\r\nWhen this analyzer is implemented, it must be documented by following the steps at [Documentation for IDE CodeStyle analyzers](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/docs/contributing/Documentation%20for%20IDE%20CodeStyle%20analyzers.md).\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/68648","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add Analyzer warning when an identifier in the local scope is overriding a type from the outer scope\" (#68648)"},{"Id":"1759197509","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-15T19:26:38","Actor":"jcouv","Number":"68641","RawContent":null,"Title":"Move ExtensionTypeTests to Emit2 project","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/68641","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Move ExtensionTypeTests to Emit2 project\" (#68641)"},{"Id":"1759376617","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-15T18:55:16","Actor":"RikkiGibson","Number":"68646","RawContent":null,"Title":"Don't accumulate interceptor information outside of batch compilation","State":"open","Body":"When InterceptsLocationAttribute is bound, we add bits from the attribute data into a ConcurrentSet on a compilation which is then used in lowering.\r\n\r\nIt isn't necessary or desired to gather up this information at all in the IDE, so let's see if we can make a change to skip doing so when we detect that we're not binding in the context of batch compilation.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/68646","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Don't accumulate interceptor information outside of batch compilation\" (#68646)"},{"Id":"1759349443","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-15T18:32:52","Actor":"tmat","Number":"68645","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update EnC-Supported-Edits.md","State":"open","Body":"Add link to work item tracking future improvements.\r\n\r\nRemove platform support info, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/hot-reload?view=vs-2022 has much better list.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/68645","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update EnC-Supported-Edits.md\" (#68645)"},{"Id":"1759335037","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-15T18:22:12","Actor":"veler","Number":"68644","RawContent":null,"Title":"Avoid loading Roslyn through All In One Search when Roslyn isn't loaded yet.","State":"open","Body":"# Problem\r\n\r\nWe found that VS's All In One Search would load the Roslyn package even if Roslyn workload isn't loaded in Visual Studio.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nWe added a new attribute that let All In One Search know that it should trigger this search provider only when Roslyn package is already loaded.\r\n\r\n# Note to reviewer\r\n\r\nI had to update some NuGet packages as you could see.

However, if I have 2 C# projects, where one project references another, those references are not updated immediately. Rather codelens continues to show old number and I need to make a change in the file to force it to recalculate the references and update the value.\n\nHere is step by step guide how to reproduce it:\n\n1. Create 2 projects where one references another (I will call them base and second projects, where second references base project)(I tested with C# only)\n2. Add a class in base project and add some properties to it\n3. Reference those properties in second project like this `myobj.Id = 1;`, so that second project uses properties of a class in base project\n4. Now when you go to created class in base project the number of references is not updated (though sometimes it works)\n5. If it is not updated, add a whitespace or another symbol somewhere so that Codelens updates the number.\n6. If you go back to second project and delete those lines of code, that use those properties and go back to base project, you will see, that number is not updated. If you open the window by clicking on number of references it will display old references (it must be done previously, if you do it first time, it will immediately update. However if you already opened this window in previous steps, nothing will be updated). By clicking on those old references you will go to the place where old reference was.\n\nThis bug occurs only with 2 projects. If both classes are in the same projects, number is updated immediately.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 6/14/2023, 09:25 PM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n\n---\n### Original Solutions\n(no solutions)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/68639","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Codelens reference counting is not updating when references are removed in other projects\" (#68639)"},{"Id":"1758947249","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-15T14:21:38","Actor":"urikanonov","Number":"68638","RawContent":null,"Title":"Roslyn API broke in upgrade from .NET SDK 7.0.302 to 7.0.304","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: \r\n.NET SDK: 7.0.304\r\n\r\nNugets:\r\n- Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Workspaces.4.6.0\r\n- Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces.MSBuild.4.6.0\r\n- Microsoft.Build.Locator.1.5.5\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1.

I wasn't sure if this belongs here or not as it relates more to the debugging experience?  Let me know if this should be filed elsewhere, or if more information is needed.\r\n\r\n## Issue description\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to step into a method which is decorated (or into a method within a class which is decorated) with an attribute such as `[DebuggerStepThrough]`, `[DebuggerNonUserCode]`, and `[DebuggerHidden]` (there may be other similar attributes but these are the ones I've tested with), I was expecting Visual Studio to step through that method and into the next available code not decorated with one of those attributes, but this did not occur.\r\n\r\nFor example, in the below code, if calling `classA.TestMethod()` I would expect it to step into `ClassC.TestMethod()`.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n    [DebuggerStepThrough]\r\n    internal class ClassA\r\n    {\r\n        private ClassC ClassC { get; }\r\n\r\n        public ClassA(ClassC classC)\r\n        {\r\n            ClassC = classC;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void TestMethod()\r\n        {\r\n            ClassC.TestMethod();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom testing, it looks like if a property accessor (get or set) is invoked within a method being stepped-through, the debugger will not step beyond them into other code.  It seems like it may be something to do with the automatic step-over functionality (`Step over properties and operators (Managed only)`).  If that setting is unchecked then it steps in as expected, but it's obviously somewhat inconvenient to have that setting turned on all the time.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\nThe project that reproduces the issue can be found [here](https://github.com/Metritutus/DebuggerStepThroughTest001).\r\n\r\n1) Place a breakpoint on line 12 in `Program.cs`.\r\n2) Run the project.\r\n3) When the breakpoint on line 12 is hit, attempt to step into the method.\r\n4) The code steps over the method instead, onto line 13.\r\n5) Attempting to step into the method on line 13 demonstrates the desired behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\nWhen stepping into `classA.TestMethod()`, the code steps through to `TestMethod()` in `ClassC`.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nThe code steps straight over `classA.TestMethod()` and on to the next line.\r\n\r\n## Additional information\r\n**OS version**: Windows 11 Version 22H2 (OS Build 22621.1555)\r\n**Visual Studio version**: 17.6.1\r\n\r\n## Update\r\n\r\nI've discovered that it's not specific to an instance method being called on a property or anything like that.  It's if a property is accessed _at all_ from within a class or method decorated with `[DebuggerStepThrough]`, etc.\r\n\r\nFor example, this won't step into `TestMethod2()` unless the line accessing the property `ClassC` is commented-out/removed:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n    internal class ClassD\r\n    {\r\n        private ClassC ClassC\r\n        {\r\n            [DebuggerHidden] // Skips the \"Your step-into request resulted in an automatic step-over\" notification window.\r\n                             // Doesn't have any bearing on the issue.\r\n            get;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public ClassD(ClassC classC)\r\n        {\r\n            ClassC = classC;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        [DebuggerStepThrough]\r\n        public void TestMethod()\r\n        {\r\n            var classC = ClassC; // Commenting-out this line will allow the code to step into TestMethod2().\r\n            TestMethod2();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void TestMethod2()\r\n        {\r\n            string whatever = \"\";\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've updated the case to try and make this more clear.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/68634","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[DebuggerStepThrough] and friends won't step through to other code if a property accessor is called from within the affected method\" (#68634)"},{"Id":"1758441940","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-15T09:40:35","Actor":"DoctorKrolic","Number":"68633","RawContent":null,"Title":"Correctly handle trivia in inline statement snippets","State":"open","Body":"Behaviour before this PR:\r\n![devenv_DwVmRJYICt](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/assets/70431552/1d863648-582d-4aff-9109-6937ddf6d422)\r\n\r\nFixed behaviour after this PR:\r\n![devenv_v30kCnuebX](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/assets/70431552/bdaf9cfd-0263-4031-b65c-6d5877d5e274)\r\n\r\nDidn't create an issue upfront because the core fix is 1 line change.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/68633","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Correctly handle trivia in inline statement snippets\" (#68633)"},{"Id":"1757728419","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-15T04:47:43","Actor":"RikkiGibson","Number":"68626","RawContent":null,"Title":"`FieldAttributes.NotSerialized` has been marked obsolete","State":"closed","Body":"This is causing a build error in https://dev.azure.com/dnceng-public/public/_build/results?buildId=307484&view=logs&j=7da62c4d-d31f-5d93-e5c8-c51357236df2&t=a48bff6a-64df-5e1b-ac45-454b273c1d9e, preventing adopting of new Arcade.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/f8cada0e6eb2aeead1c242d83defa3596b5f2c84/src/Compilers/Core/Portable/PEWriter/MetadataWriter.cs#L766-L769\r\n\r\nI think the fix here is to suppress the warning in Roslyn, as in this case we're simply propagating along the fact that a field in the user's code has this pseudo-custom attribute.\r\n\r\nRelated to dotnet/docs#34893","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/68626","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"`FieldAttributes.NotSerialized` has been marked obsolete\" (#68626)"},{"Id":"1757740667","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-15T04:47:42","Actor":"RikkiGibson","Number":"68627","RawContent":null,"Title":"Suppress formatter-based serialization warnings in MetadataWriter","State":"closed","Body":"Closes #68626\r\n\r\ncc @dibarbet","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/68627","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Suppress formatter-based serialization warnings in MetadataWriter\" (#68627)"},{"Id":"1757878089","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-15T01:29:14","Actor":"ufcpp","Number":"68632","RawContent":null,"Title":"MissingImports is not respecting .editorconfig","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: \r\nVersion 17.7.0 Preview 2.0\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1.

This message always showed, independent if the cert was actually installed or not. Additionally, the text specific to the cert provided a command only applicable to Windows and MacOS. I've separated the cert text out of the \"More Info\" section, and created 2 other resource strings; one for Windows/MacOS and one for Linux. I've updated the printing logic to only print the cert message when the cert is installed, and only print the correct message depending on the current OS.\r\n\r\n*Note*: There is 1 extra blank line now that the cert message is separated from the \"More Info\" message. If we want that extra line removed, I'm just gonna refactor this code since it is written quite clunky at the moment.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n### Old Message (shown on all platforms)\r\n```\r\n> dotnet --help\r\n\r\nWelcome to .NET 7.0!\r\n---------------------\r\nSDK Version: 7.0.400-preview.23225.8\r\n\r\nTelemetry\r\n---------\r\nThe .NET tools collect usage data in order to help us improve your experience.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\n# Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\nBuilding the .NET product from individual product repos in the [dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet) organization is a complex process requiring orchestration infrastructure that is available only to Microsoft. This is a hindrance to the .NET community as it's currently not possible to easily reproduce the official product build in the open. Furthermore, the complexity of the official build and release infrastructure tends to grow over the years. This presents many reliability and sustainability challenges.  \r\n\r\nTo address the abovementioned issues, **we'd like to announce a new repository** - https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet - which is the first step on the way to simplify building and shipping of .NET and making the product build process transparent to and reproducible by the community.\r\n\r\nThis new repository is a **Virtual Monolithic Repository (VMR)**. It includes all the code needed to build the .NET SDK, mirrored from the individual product repos (such as [dotnet/roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) or [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime)). It also includes [source-build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build), our whole-product build system used to build .NET by our Linux partners.\r\n\r\nThe VMR has the following main characteristics:\r\n- **Monolithic** - The repository is monolithic so that a single commit fully identifies the whole source code necessary to build the .NET SDK\r\n- **Virtual** - It's a mirror (not a replacement) of the individual product repos that make up the whole product, placed side-by-side in one repository. Changes to the underlying individual product repositories are synchronized to the VMR.\r\n- **Experimental** - Currently, the repository is part of our initiative to streamline the release process, not meant to be depended on. We reserve the right to delete the current instance and create a new, different one in its stead. We expect the repository to be persistent by the release of .NET 8 Preview 1, planned for February, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe repository is a work-in-progress and has a lot of [limitations](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet#limitations) but we believe that even with these limitations it can be already useful in a variety of scenarios.\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Goals of the Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\n- The main purpose of the [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet) repository is to have all source code necessary to build the .NET product available in one repository and identified by a single commit.\r\n- The VMR also aims to become the place from which we release and service future versions of .NET to reduce the complexity of the product construction process. This should allow our partners and and 3rd parties to easily build, test and modify .NET using their custom infrastructure as well as make the process available to the community.\r\n- Lastly, we hope to solve other problems that the current multi-repo setup brings:\r\n  -  Enable developers to make and test changes spanning multiple repositories.\r\n  -  Fulfill requirements of .NET distro builders such as RedHat or Canonical to natively include .NET in their distribution repositories.\r\n  - Simplify scenarios such as client-run testing of bug fixes and improvements. The build should work in an offline environment too for certain platforms.\r\n  - Enable the standard [down-/up-stream open-source model](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md).\r\n  - More efficient pipeline for security fixes during the CVE pre-disclosure process.\r\n\r\n## 📖 Further reading\r\n\r\nIn case you are interested in knowing more about the why's and how's of VMR's purpose, design and architecture, you may find the following set of documents interesting:\r\n  - [VMR's Design and Operation](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Design-And-Operation.md)\r\n  - [Upstream/Downstream Relationships](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md)\r\n  - [Code and Build Workflow](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Code-And-Build-Workflow.md)\r\n  - [Strategy for Managing External Source Dependencies](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Strategy-For-External-Source.md)\r\n\r\nThe build of the VMR is made possible by the [.NET Source-Build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build).\r\n\r\n## 💬 Discussion\r\n\r\nYou can share your thoughts on the VMR or see what others are saying at https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/11584\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/241","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\" (#241)"},{"Id":"1440663435","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-08T18:02:27","Actor":"dcwhittaker","Number":"240","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET November 2022 Updates","State":"open","Body":"Microsoft released the following [.NET Updates in November 2022](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/november-2022-updates/).\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Releases </h2>\r\n\r\n* [.NET 6.0.11 and .NET SDK 6.0.111](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.11/6.0.11.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0))\r\n* [.NET Core 3.1.31 and .NET SDK 3.1.425](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1.31/3.1.31.md)  ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1))\r\n\r\nThis issue will be updated if there are any additional releases during the month.\r\n\r\n## Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?\r\n\r\nYour app may be affected by many security vulnerabilities if you have not been installing .NET 6 patches. \r\n\r\n[Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/cve.md) makes it easy to tell how many CVEs affect your app, given the .NET 6 patch version you currently have deployed.\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Support Policies</h2>\r\nMicrosoft support policies are defined in the following documents:\r\n\r\n* [Currently Supported Releases](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md)\r\n* [Microsoft .NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/240","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET November 2022 Updates\" (#240)"},{"Id":"1440661312","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-08T18:01:14","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"239","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory  CVE 2022-41064 | .NET Information Disclosure Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory  CVE 2022-41064 | .NET Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET, .NET Core and .NET Framework's System.Data.SqlClient and Microsoft.Data.SqlClient NuGet Packages.\r\n\r\nA vulnerability exists in System.Data.SqlClient and Microsoft.Data.SqlClient libraries where a timeout occurring under high load can cause incorrect data to be returned as the result of an asynchronously executed query.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/78042\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nIf you are not talking to Microsoft SQL Server from your application you are not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-packages\"></a>Affected packages\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\n[System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient/) | <=4.8.4 | 4.8.5\r\n[Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient/) | <= 1.1.3, 2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.1.0, 2.1.1 | 1.1.4, >=2.1.2\r\n\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n.NET has two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. \r\n\r\nFor example, the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc package depends on the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core package. When you add a dependency on Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core. \r\n \r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the  [affected packages](#affected-packages) listed above are vulnerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n* If you are using System.Data.SqlClient on .NET Framework you must install the November update for .NET Framework\r\n* If you are using System.Data.SqlClient on .NET Core, .NET 5 or .NET 6 you must update the nuget package to an updated version as listed in the [affected packages](#affected-packages).\r\n* If you are using Microsoft.Data.SqlClient, anywhere (.NET Core, .NET 5/6, .NET Framework) and you are using a version that is vulnerable you must update as listed in the [affected packages](#affected-packages).\r\n\r\nIf you don't know the difference between Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient please read the [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient initial announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-the-new-microsoftdatasqlclient/)  for an explanation,\r\n\r\n**Additional Details**\r\n\r\n.NET and .NET Framework projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, .NET Framework users must also install the November 2022 security patch to be protected. \r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies \r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your csproj file. They can be fixed by editing the project file or using nuget command line to update the dependency. \r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies \r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. Transitive dependencies can be discovered by searching the project.assets.json file for each of your projects. This file is produced on each build and is in the obj directory for each project. \r\n\r\nThe project.assets.json files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### Fixing direct dependencies \r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are nuget packages that have been specifically added to a project, rather than being pulled in because a nuget package added requires it. They can be seen in the solution explorer in Visual Studio or by opening the csproj for the project and examining the packageReference nodes for the package name, specified by the Include parameter, and its version, specified by the Version parameter.  \r\n\r\nFor example, the following project file has a direct dependency on version 2.1.1 of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. \r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"2.1.1\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project> \r\n```\r\n#### Fixing direct dependencies with the nuget command line \r\n\r\nOpen a command line to the directory holding your project \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you are using a version of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient between 2.0.0 and 2.1.1 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient --version 2.1.2 \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you are using a version of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient below 1.1.4 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient --version 1.1.4 \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you are using a version of System.Data.SqlClient below 4.8.4 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package System.Data.SqlClient --version 4.8.5 \r\n\r\n#### Fixing direct dependencies by editing the project file \r\n\r\nOpen projectname.csproj in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose Edit projectname.csproj from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.  \r\n\r\nLook for PackageReference elements. The following shows an example project file: \r\n\r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"2.1.1\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project> \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference tone of the vulnerable packages as seen by the single PackageReference element. The name of the package is in the Include attribute. \r\nThe package version number is in the Version attribute. \r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed in the Affected software section of this document. \r\n\r\nIn this example, update Microsoft.Data.SqlClient to the appropriate fixed version for your major version. Save the csproj file. The example csproj now looks as follows: \r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"2.1.2\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated csproj file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. \r\n\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the Output window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager. \r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the dotnet restore command to restore the updated dependencies. \r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a Dependency conflict warning, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package. \r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies \r\n\r\nRebuild your solution and then open the project.assets.json file from in each of your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file. Both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing. \r\n\r\nSearch the project.assets.json file for the vulnerable packages above using the format packagename/ for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search: \r\n\r\nExamine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the /. \r\n\r\nCompare to the vulnerable versions \r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows \"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\": \"2.1.0\" is a reference to version 2.1.0 of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient If your project.assets.json file includes vulnerable versions of the nuget packages then you need to fix the transitive dependencies. \r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either \r\n\r\nNone of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or \r\n\r\nYou have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies. \r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the vulnerable package, you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your csproj file to override the transitive dependency. \r\n\r\n#### Editing projects to fix transitive dependencies \r\n\r\nOpen projectname.csproj in your editor. Look for PackageReference nodes, for example: \r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"IndirectDependency\" Version=\"1.0.0\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project> \r\n```\r\n \r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated, matching major/minor version of the vulnerable by adding it to the csproj file. This is done by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version. For example,  \r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"IndirectDependency\" Version=\"1.0.0\" /> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"2.1.2\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project> \r\n\r\n ```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your csproj file. \r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated csproj file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager. \r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the dotnet restore command to restore the new dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### Using the nuget command line to fix transitive dependencies \r\n\r\nOpen a command window and change directory to your project directory.  \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you have an indirect dependency on Microsoft.Data.SqlClient between versions 2.0.0 and 2.1.1 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient --version 2.1.2 \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you have an indirect dependency on Microsoft.Data.SqlClient below 1.1.4 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient --version 1.1.4 \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you have an indirect dependency on System.Data.SqlClient below 4.8.4 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package System.Data.SqlClient --version 4.8.5 \r\n\r\nExecute the dotnet restore command to restore the new dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application \r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy. \r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 6.0, please email details to [secure@microsoft.com](secure@microsoft.com).

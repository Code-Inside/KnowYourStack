It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"702426498","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-16T06:07:11","Actor":"billvenhaus","Number":"1774","RawContent":null,"Title":"[UWP] HttpClientHandler - Digest Authentication Broken on Windows 10 PC","State":"closed","Body":"Just recently I found that my UWP app can no longer connect with Digest authentication on Windows 10 PCs.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption.

This implicit functionality is not defined as an actual API and can mask any explicit API surface the user has defined themselves.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following program:\r\n```csharp\r\nusing System.Diagnostics.CodeAnalysis;\r\nusing System.Runtime.CompilerServices;\r\n\r\nS1 s1 = default;\r\n_ = s1[0];\r\n_ = s1[(nuint)0];\r\n\r\n[InlineArray(10)]\r\npublic struct S1\r\n{\r\n    public int _x;\r\n\r\n    [UnscopedRef]\r\n    public ref int this[int index]\r\n    {\r\n        get\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"int indexer\");\r\n            return ref Unsafe.Add(ref Unsafe.As<S1, int>(ref this), index);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [UnscopedRef]\r\n    public ref int this[nuint index]\r\n    {\r\n        get\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"nuint indexer\");\r\n            return ref Unsafe.Add(ref Unsafe.As<S1, int>(ref this), index);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutputs:\r\n```\r\nnuint indexer\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expected output from the user might have been:\r\n```\r\nint indexer\r\nnuint indexer\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe compiler should surface a warning indicating that the member is now hidden and inaccessible:\r\n```\r\n// ...\r\n    [UnscopedRef]\r\n    public ref int this[int index] // CS----: Inline array member is inaccessible in C# 12 or later\r\n    {\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nA warning, rather than an error, is emitted to ensure that users are not forced to break binary compatibility if they are migrating an existing type to use `[InlineArray]`. \r\n\r\n### Alternative Designs\r\n\r\nThe language could also actually define a public indexer for the various types it supports and then surface `CS0111: Type 'S1' already defines a member called 'this' with the same parameter types`. However, this would increase the size of the type and could lead to \"less ideal\" IL emitted since it would be one more thing the JIT has to process and potentially inline.\r\n\r\nRelates to test plan https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/67826","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/68868","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Surface a warning at the declaration site for members that will be hidden by the language `[InlineArray]` support\" (#68868)"},{"Id":"1786713665","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-03T19:34:24","Actor":"tannergooding","Number":"68867","RawContent":null,"Title":"Surface a warning at the declaration site for language incompatible `[InlineArray]` types","State":"open","Body":"### Summary\r\n\r\nThe new `[InlineArray]` works for most, but not all, types. It also currently surfaces errors for some, but not all, \"invalid\" declarations.\r\n\r\nFor example, the compiler currently surfaces an error if you have more than 1 field:\r\n```csharp\r\n[InlineArray(10)]\r\npublic struct S1 // CS9169: Inline array struct must declare one and only one instance field.\r\n{\r\n    public int _x;\r\n    public int _y;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt does not surface any warning or error for the following code, however:\r\n```csharp\r\n[InlineArray(10)]\r\npublic struct S2\r\n{\r\n    public int* _x;\r\n}\r\n\r\n[InlineArray(10)]\r\npublic ref struct S3\r\n{\r\n    public ref int _x;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, an error is only surfaced when attempting to use language syntax with these types:\r\n```csharp\r\nS2 s2 = default;\r\nS3 s3 = default;\r\n\r\ns2[0] = default; // CS0021: Cannot apply indexing with [] to an expression of type 'S1'\r\ns3[0] = default; // CS0021: Cannot apply indexing with [] to an expression of type 'S1'\r\n\r\n// For non-constant indexing, the compiler may also surface\r\n//     CS0306: The type 'int*' may not be used as a type argument\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nGiven that `S2` and `S3` are valid from the `runtime` perspective and only incompatible with the `language` support for `InlineArray`, the compiler should raise a `warning` that surfaces this incompatibility and that language syntax will not be available.\r\n\r\nThe developer can then make the decision to suppress the warning or to expose the support in a different manner. For example, the developer could desire still exposing the types \"as is\" and defining their own helper APIs to allow correct indexing. They could alternatively desire to expose this using some wrapper type or via a same sized alternative.\r\n\r\nThe following would then all be \"valid\" options for the user:\r\n```csharp\r\n// Disable the warning\r\n#pragma warning disable CS----\r\n[InlineArray(10)]\r\npublic struct S2\r\n{\r\n    public int* _x;\r\n}\r\n#pragma warning restore CS----\r\n\r\n// Use a wrapper type\r\npublic struct Pointer<T>\r\n    where T : unmanaged\r\n{\r\n    T Value;\r\n}\r\n\r\n[InlineArray(10)]\r\npublic struct S2\r\n{\r\n    public Pointer<int> _x;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Use a same sized primitive\r\n[InlineArray(10)]\r\npublic struct S2\r\n{\r\n    public nuint _x;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nRelates to test plan https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/67826","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/68867","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Surface a warning at the declaration site for language incompatible `[InlineArray]` types\" (#68867)"},{"Id":"1786692897","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-03T19:15:22","Actor":"cston","Number":"68866","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge features/CollectionLiterals into release/dev17.7","State":"open","Body":"Merge https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/commit/77d31926ed0ea98de1add13d3e725a25674dd3a8 into release/dev17.7.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/68866","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Merge features/CollectionLiterals into release/dev17.7\" (#68866)"},{"Id":"1786692340","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-03T19:14:44","Actor":"pieandcakes","Number":"68865","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update Telemetry version to 17.7.57","State":"open","Body":"Updating to latest version","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/68865","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update Telemetry version to 17.7.57\" (#68865)"},{"Id":"1786690709","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-03T19:13:08","Actor":"AlekseyTs","Number":"68864","RawContent":null,"Title":"Warn on shadowing primary constructor parameter by a member from base","State":"open","Body":"https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/main/proposals/primary-constructors.md#warn-on-shadowing-by-a-member-from-base","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/68864","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Warn on shadowing primary constructor parameter by a member from base\" (#68864)"},{"Id":"1786671145","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-03T18:57:28","Actor":"RadicalErin","Number":"68863","RawContent":null,"Title":"CS1591 Thinks \"protected\" is public","State":"open","Body":"The error message around CS1591 [\"missing xml comment for publicly visible type or member\"] describes the item the warning relates to as \"publicly visible\".

To publish I use this line:\r\n\r\ndotnet publish GtWebApi.sln -c Release -o C:\\My\\Publish --self-contained false\r\n\r\nThis will publish GtWebApi but it never publishes Gt.WebApi. On top of that I have had to add all dlls as project references to GtWebApi so they all satellite assemblies will be published. The sln is setup to have all the dependencies it needs. I do not understand why publish does not honor what is there. \r\n\r\nThe sln looks like this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/assets/5032382/2cf48273-9dc2-453a-9ed6-e8ad64042f6d)\r\n\r\nThere are two web apps Gt.IDP (identity provider) and Gt.WebApi which is a blazor webassembly and api. Both depend on the common libraries: GtData, GtBase, GtResources etc. GtData has a post build event that creates two directories x86 and x64 and copies an x86 and x64 library to each directory.\r\n\r\nBoth Gt.IDP and Gt.WebApi had the error:\r\n\r\nFound multiple publish output files with the same relative path for the library versions copied to x86 and x64.\r\n\r\nThis error is taken care of by using ErrorOnDuplicatePublishOutputFiles false in the relevant projects.\r\n\r\nThen the error about not enabling optimization is displayed when trying to publish, so using PublishTrimmed false takes \r\ncare of that.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen using:\r\n\r\n`dotnet publish GtWebApi.sln -c Release -o C:\\Repository\\Gt\\Publish -r win-x64`\r\n\r\npublishes the Gt.IDP, but not the Gt.WebApi, and it makes it self contained which we don't want. Using self contained false with -r produces errors and does not work. I thought this was fixed in net 7 but its not. We are using net sdk 7.0.304.\r\n\r\nThen if I use a VS 2022 17.6.3 folder publish, we get the Gt.WebApi but not Gt.IDP.\r\n\r\nThe sln is setup to have all the dependencies it needs. I do not understand why publish does not honor what is there. It does not even copy a directory and its contents that are created as a build post event. How can I get everything in the sln pushed to publish directory and directories built by post build events into the publish directory?\r\n\r\nTo me it is a bug that publish does not put everything from the sln into the publish directory. I had to make sure and add all satellite assemblies to Gt.WebApi so that publish would even push them to the publish directory. Why does publish try to re-invent the wheel but yet not even do what release build can do? We are putting everything into one sln so that we will have one installer, and do one publish. Instead the way publish works now we would need to have two publish commands. \r\n\r\nFrom [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish) dotnet publish works on sln files.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/33742","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Why does dotnet publish not publish everything in a sln\" (#33742)"},{"Id":"1783078943","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-30T21:09:34","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"33740","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:4491d9a4-839d-4af5-f3e4-08d8e97c775d)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore\r\n- **Subscription**: 4491d9a4-839d-4af5-f3e4-08d8e97c775d\r\n- **Build**: 20230630.2\r\n- **Date Produced**: June 30, 2023 7:36:38 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 681cb8e545dc18def757169f56bb08ccd2701427\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\n# Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\nBuilding the .NET product from individual product repos in the [dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet) organization is a complex process requiring orchestration infrastructure that is available only to Microsoft. This is a hindrance to the .NET community as it's currently not possible to easily reproduce the official product build in the open. Furthermore, the complexity of the official build and release infrastructure tends to grow over the years. This presents many reliability and sustainability challenges.  \r\n\r\nTo address the abovementioned issues, **we'd like to announce a new repository** - https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet - which is the first step on the way to simplify building and shipping of .NET and making the product build process transparent to and reproducible by the community.\r\n\r\nThis new repository is a **Virtual Monolithic Repository (VMR)**. It includes all the code needed to build the .NET SDK, mirrored from the individual product repos (such as [dotnet/roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) or [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime)). It also includes [source-build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build), our whole-product build system used to build .NET by our Linux partners.\r\n\r\nThe VMR has the following main characteristics:\r\n- **Monolithic** - The repository is monolithic so that a single commit fully identifies the whole source code necessary to build the .NET SDK\r\n- **Virtual** - It's a mirror (not a replacement) of the individual product repos that make up the whole product, placed side-by-side in one repository. Changes to the underlying individual product repositories are synchronized to the VMR.\r\n- **Experimental** - Currently, the repository is part of our initiative to streamline the release process, not meant to be depended on. We reserve the right to delete the current instance and create a new, different one in its stead. We expect the repository to be persistent by the release of .NET 8 Preview 1, planned for February, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe repository is a work-in-progress and has a lot of [limitations](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet#limitations) but we believe that even with these limitations it can be already useful in a variety of scenarios.\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Goals of the Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\n- The main purpose of the [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet) repository is to have all source code necessary to build the .NET product available in one repository and identified by a single commit.\r\n- The VMR also aims to become the place from which we release and service future versions of .NET to reduce the complexity of the product construction process. This should allow our partners and and 3rd parties to easily build, test and modify .NET using their custom infrastructure as well as make the process available to the community.\r\n- Lastly, we hope to solve other problems that the current multi-repo setup brings:\r\n  -  Enable developers to make and test changes spanning multiple repositories.\r\n  -  Fulfill requirements of .NET distro builders such as RedHat or Canonical to natively include .NET in their distribution repositories.\r\n  - Simplify scenarios such as client-run testing of bug fixes and improvements. The build should work in an offline environment too for certain platforms.\r\n  - Enable the standard [down-/up-stream open-source model](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md).\r\n  - More efficient pipeline for security fixes during the CVE pre-disclosure process.\r\n\r\n## 📖 Further reading\r\n\r\nIn case you are interested in knowing more about the why's and how's of VMR's purpose, design and architecture, you may find the following set of documents interesting:\r\n  - [VMR's Design and Operation](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Design-And-Operation.md)\r\n  - [Upstream/Downstream Relationships](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md)\r\n  - [Code and Build Workflow](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Code-And-Build-Workflow.md)\r\n  - [Strategy for Managing External Source Dependencies](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Strategy-For-External-Source.md)\r\n\r\nThe build of the VMR is made possible by the [.NET Source-Build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build).\r\n\r\n## 💬 Discussion\r\n\r\nYou can share your thoughts on the VMR or see what others are saying at https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/11584\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/241","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\" (#241)"},{"Id":"1440663435","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-08T18:02:27","Actor":"dcwhittaker","Number":"240","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET November 2022 Updates","State":"open","Body":"Microsoft released the following [.NET Updates in November 2022](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/november-2022-updates/).\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Releases </h2>\r\n\r\n* [.NET 6.0.11 and .NET SDK 6.0.111](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.11/6.0.11.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0))\r\n* [.NET Core 3.1.31 and .NET SDK 3.1.425](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1.31/3.1.31.md)  ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1))\r\n\r\nThis issue will be updated if there are any additional releases during the month.\r\n\r\n## Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?\r\n\r\nYour app may be affected by many security vulnerabilities if you have not been installing .NET 6 patches. \r\n\r\n[Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/cve.md) makes it easy to tell how many CVEs affect your app, given the .NET 6 patch version you currently have deployed.\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Support Policies</h2>\r\nMicrosoft support policies are defined in the following documents:\r\n\r\n* [Currently Supported Releases](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md)\r\n* [Microsoft .NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/240","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET November 2022 Updates\" (#240)"},{"Id":"1440661312","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-08T18:01:14","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"239","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory  CVE 2022-41064 | .NET Information Disclosure Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory  CVE 2022-41064 | .NET Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET, .NET Core and .NET Framework's System.Data.SqlClient and Microsoft.Data.SqlClient NuGet Packages.\r\n\r\nA vulnerability exists in System.Data.SqlClient and Microsoft.Data.SqlClient libraries where a timeout occurring under high load can cause incorrect data to be returned as the result of an asynchronously executed query.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/78042\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nIf you are not talking to Microsoft SQL Server from your application you are not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-packages\"></a>Affected packages\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\n[System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient/) | <=4.8.4 | 4.8.5\r\n[Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient/) | <= 1.1.3, 2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.1.0, 2.1.1 | 1.1.4, >=2.1.2\r\n\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n.NET has two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. \r\n\r\nFor example, the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc package depends on the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core package. When you add a dependency on Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core. \r\n \r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the  [affected packages](#affected-packages) listed above are vulnerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n* If you are using System.Data.SqlClient on .NET Framework you must install the November update for .NET Framework\r\n* If you are using System.Data.SqlClient on .NET Core, .NET 5 or .NET 6 you must update the nuget package to an updated version as listed in the [affected packages](#affected-packages).\r\n* If you are using Microsoft.Data.SqlClient, anywhere (.NET Core, .NET 5/6, .NET Framework) and you are using a version that is vulnerable you must update as listed in the [affected packages](#affected-packages).\r\n\r\nIf you don't know the difference between Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient please read the [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient initial announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-the-new-microsoftdatasqlclient/)  for an explanation,\r\n\r\n**Additional Details**\r\n\r\n.NET and .NET Framework projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, .NET Framework users must also install the November 2022 security patch to be protected. \r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies \r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your csproj file. They can be fixed by editing the project file or using nuget command line to update the dependency. \r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies \r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. Transitive dependencies can be discovered by searching the project.assets.json file for each of your projects. This file is produced on each build and is in the obj directory for each project. \r\n\r\nThe project.assets.json files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### Fixing direct dependencies \r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are nuget packages that have been specifically added to a project, rather than being pulled in because a nuget package added requires it. They can be seen in the solution explorer in Visual Studio or by opening the csproj for the project and examining the packageReference nodes for the package name, specified by the Include parameter, and its version, specified by the Version parameter.  \r\n\r\nFor example, the following project file has a direct dependency on version 2.1.1 of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. \r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"2.1.1\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project> \r\n```\r\n#### Fixing direct dependencies with the nuget command line \r\n\r\nOpen a command line to the directory holding your project \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you are using a version of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient between 2.0.0 and 2.1.1 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient --version 2.1.2 \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you are using a version of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient below 1.1.4 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient --version 1.1.4 \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you are using a version of System.Data.SqlClient below 4.8.4 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package System.Data.SqlClient --version 4.8.5 \r\n\r\n#### Fixing direct dependencies by editing the project file \r\n\r\nOpen projectname.csproj in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose Edit projectname.csproj from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.  \r\n\r\nLook for PackageReference elements. The following shows an example project file: \r\n\r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"2.1.1\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project> \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference tone of the vulnerable packages as seen by the single PackageReference element. The name of the package is in the Include attribute. \r\nThe package version number is in the Version attribute. \r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed in the Affected software section of this document. \r\n\r\nIn this example, update Microsoft.Data.SqlClient to the appropriate fixed version for your major version. Save the csproj file. The example csproj now looks as follows: \r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"2.1.2\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated csproj file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. \r\n\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the Output window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager. \r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the dotnet restore command to restore the updated dependencies. \r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a Dependency conflict warning, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package. \r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies \r\n\r\nRebuild your solution and then open the project.assets.json file from in each of your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file. Both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing. \r\n\r\nSearch the project.assets.json file for the vulnerable packages above using the format packagename/ for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search: \r\n\r\nExamine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the /. \r\n\r\nCompare to the vulnerable versions \r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows \"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\": \"2.1.0\" is a reference to version 2.1.0 of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient If your project.assets.json file includes vulnerable versions of the nuget packages then you need to fix the transitive dependencies. \r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either \r\n\r\nNone of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or \r\n\r\nYou have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies. \r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the vulnerable package, you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your csproj file to override the transitive dependency. \r\n\r\n#### Editing projects to fix transitive dependencies \r\n\r\nOpen projectname.csproj in your editor. Look for PackageReference nodes, for example: \r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"IndirectDependency\" Version=\"1.0.0\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project> \r\n```\r\n \r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated, matching major/minor version of the vulnerable by adding it to the csproj file. This is done by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version. For example,  \r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"IndirectDependency\" Version=\"1.0.0\" /> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"2.1.2\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project> \r\n\r\n ```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your csproj file. \r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated csproj file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager. \r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the dotnet restore command to restore the new dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### Using the nuget command line to fix transitive dependencies \r\n\r\nOpen a command window and change directory to your project directory.  \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you have an indirect dependency on Microsoft.Data.SqlClient between versions 2.0.0 and 2.1.1 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient --version 2.1.2 \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you have an indirect dependency on Microsoft.Data.SqlClient below 1.1.4 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient --version 1.1.4 \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you have an indirect dependency on System.Data.SqlClient below 4.8.4 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package System.Data.SqlClient --version 4.8.5 \r\n\r\nExecute the dotnet restore command to restore the new dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application \r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy. \r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 6.0, please email details to [secure@microsoft.com](secure@microsoft.com).

For example, \"foobar\" will be treated as the default scheme in the code below.\r\n\r\n```chsarp\r\nbuilder.Services.AddAuthentication().AddOAuth(\"foobar\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change might expose unintended behavior changes in applications, such as authentication options being validated earlier than expected.\r\n\r\n**Discussion**\r\n\r\nThis change can be discussed in https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/42828.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/231","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Changes in default authentication scheme handling for ASP.NET Core\" (#231)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2023-07-04T03:30:18.633729Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":8020}

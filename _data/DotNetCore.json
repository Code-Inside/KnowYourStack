This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability which exists when .NET Core improperly handles web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against a .NET Core web application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.\r\n\r\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the .NET Core application.\r\n\r\n_The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the .NET Core web application handles web requests. The previous update contained an incomplete fix, the runtime and SDK version numbers have now been updated to the runtimes and SDKs that have the complete fix. This new issue has been created for users which subscribe to the announcements via email or other automated means which may not show issue changes._\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/36313\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\n* Any .NET Core 2.1 application running on .NET Core 2.1.19 or lower\r\n* Any .NET Core 3.1 application running on .NET Core 3.1.5 or lower\r\n* Any .NET 5 application running on .NET 5 Preview 3 or lower\r\n\r\nPlease note that .NET Core 3.0 is now out of support and all applications should be updated to 3.1.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software) you are exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET Core. If you have multiple versions of .NET Core installed you will need to install multiple runtimes, or SDKs depending on what you have installed. If you have installed one or more .NET Core SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio which will also update your .NET Core SDKs.\r\n\r\nYou can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.1 you should download and install Runtime 2.1.18 or SDK 2.1.515 (for Visual Studio 2017 v15.9), 2.1.612 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.0) or 2.1.807 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.2 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.1 you should download and install Runtime 3.1.4 or SDK 3.1.105 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.4) or 3.1.301 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.5 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1\r\n* For machines running .NET 5 Preview you should download and install .NET 5 Preview 4 when available from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple affected versions you must update the runtime or SDKs for each version.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This PR ports that fix to _release/3.1_.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nSetting a debugger breakpoint on Amd64 (x64) can result in incorrect calculation of floating point values. \r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nThis was a known and difficult to fix issue. The hand written Amd64 instruction parser was flaky and nearly impossible to maintain.\r\n\r\nThe problem arose because the debugger must determine the length and form of the instruction where the breakpoint is inserted. The original code was a minimal implementation which only covered the instruction form historically used by the JIT.  As new forms and especially intrinsics were added, the code was not updated because the complexity was far too high. \r\n\r\nWe completely missed decode of all x64 simd instruction forms.\r\n\r\nThe fix required was this substantial change. At the time we missed the 3.0 branch and we did not have sufficient feedback to consider backport to 3.x.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n+ This code was manually tested to fix the originally reported issue.\r\n  + Additionally the same code was tested for regressions in other areas.\r\n    + Trying a breakpoint on every line of code\r\n    + Stepping through every line of code \r\n+ The code has been in the 5.0 branch for more than 6 months with no new regressions\r\n  + Shipped in all .NET Core 5.0 previews to date\r\n  + Over the last 90 days, there have been \r\n     + 184K debugging sessions launched on .NET Core 5 previews\r\n     + from 3.3K unique MAC addresses\r\n  + We have no reports of issues linked to this fix\r\n+ The 5.0 code has been tested against recently reported similar issues\r\n  + We have several confirmation that this issue observed in 3.0/3.1 has been fixed by 5.0 \r\n+ The internal diagnostic test suite was amended to test for this issue and prevent further identical regressions.\r\n+ @tommcdon & @hoyosjs have each used the x64 debugger since this change for debugging various reported/discovered issues. They saw no issues suggesting a regression.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\nLow. \r\n+ dotnet/coreclr#25958 has been in 5.0 since 9/2019\r\n+ Only affects x64 debugger operation. \r\n+ Removes a flaky instruction parser and replaces it with a machine generated one.  \r\n  + Rewrites one function `NativeWalker::DecodeInstructionForPatchSkip()`.  Used only for debugging x64 code.\r\n  + Adds 1 new machine generated instruction decode table. (10k lines)\r\n+ Adds tools to regenerate the parser tables\r\n  + Add 3 files to archive the tool used to generate the decode table.to machine generate. (Only used in development) \r\n+ Adds documentation (1 file)\r\n+ Sufficient testing coverage\r\n \r\n## Code Reviewers\r\n@hoyosjs @tannergooding @noahfalk @jkotas "}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CLI":{"Events":[{"Id":"12663810136","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-18T02:34:52","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/cli","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/13399","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[release/3.1.4xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/sdk\" (#13399) at dotnet/cli","RelatedBody":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:74485d57-5bac-4f07-aa46-08d7e6f22aae)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/sdk\r\n- **Subscription**: 74485d57-5bac-4f07-aa46-08d7e6f22aae\r\n- **Build**: 20200617.6\r\n- **Date Produced**: 6/17/2020 11:22 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 7594743c4ebaf05b5db3d91db374ed2db5374a59\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.1.4xx\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.Sdk**: from 3.1.400-preview.20312.12 to 3.1.400-preview.20317.6\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:74485d57-5bac-4f07-aa46-08d7e6f22aae)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"12656403734","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-17T11:57:08","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/cli","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/13399","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[release/3.1.4xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/sdk\" (#13399) at dotnet/cli","RelatedBody":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:74485d57-5bac-4f07-aa46-08d7e6f22aae)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/sdk\r\n- **Subscription**: 74485d57-5bac-4f07-aa46-08d7e6f22aae\r\n- **Build**: 20200617.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: 6/17/2020 11:39 AM\r\n- **Commit**: d554b5edcf3c45f5aa99d7194bb425b06167063f\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.1.4xx\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.Sdk**: from 3.1.400-preview.20312.12 to 3.1.400-preview.20317.1\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:74485d57-5bac-4f07-aa46-08d7e6f22aae)\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"12648506121","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-16T17:51:19","Actor":"wli3","Repository":"dotnet/cli","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/13395","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Update aspnet, coresetup to servicing-31150, preview1-26216-03, respectively (release/2.1.5xx)\" (#13395) at dotnet/cli","RelatedBody":"/cc @dotnet/dotnet-cli"},{"Id":"12648504098","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-16T17:51:07","Actor":"wli3","Repository":"dotnet/cli","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/13394","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Update aspnet, coresetup to servicing-31150, preview1-26216-03, respectively (release/2.1.6xx)\" (#13394) at dotnet/cli","RelatedBody":"/cc @dotnet/dotnet-cli"},{"Id":"12648501900","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-16T17:50:51","Actor":"wli3","Repository":"dotnet/cli","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/13392","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"[automated] Merge branch 'release/3.1.1xx' => 'release/3.1.2xx'\" (#13392) at dotnet/cli","RelatedBody":"I detected changes in the release/3.1.1xx branch which have not been merged yet to release/3.1.2xx.

This PR ports that fix to _release/3.1_.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nSetting a debugger breakpoint on Amd64 (x64) can result in incorrect calculation of floating point values. \r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nThis was a known and difficult to fix issue. The hand written Amd64 instruction parser was flaky and nearly impossible to maintain.\r\n\r\nThe problem arose because the debugger must determine the length and form of the instruction where the breakpoint is inserted. The original code was a minimal implementation which only covered the instruction form historically used by the JIT.  As new forms and especially intrinsics were added, the code was not updated because the complexity was far too high. \r\n\r\nWe completely missed decode of all x64 simd instruction forms.\r\n\r\nThe fix required was this substantial change. At the time we missed the 3.0 branch and we did not have sufficient feedback to consider backport to 3.x.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n+ This code was manually tested to fix the originally reported issue.\r\n  + Additionally the same code was tested for regressions in other areas.\r\n    + Trying a breakpoint on every line of code\r\n    + Stepping through every line of code \r\n+ The code has been in the 5.0 branch for more than 6 months with no new regressions\r\n  + Shipped in all .NET Core 5.0 previews to date\r\n  + Over the last 90 days, there have been \r\n     + 184K debugging sessions launched on .NET Core 5 previews\r\n     + from 3.3K unique MAC addresses\r\n  + We have no reports of issues linked to this fix\r\n+ The 5.0 code has been tested against recently reported similar issues\r\n  + We have several confirmation that this issue observed in 3.0/3.1 has been fixed by 5.0 \r\n+ The internal diagnostic test suite was amended to test for this issue and prevent further identical regressions.\r\n+ @tommcdon & @hoyosjs have each used the x64 debugger since this change for debugging various reported/discovered issues. They saw no issues suggesting a regression.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\nLow. \r\n+ dotnet/coreclr#25958 has been in 5.0 since 9/2019\r\n+ Only affects x64 debugger operation. \r\n+ Removes a flaky instruction parser and replaces it with a machine generated one.  \r\n  + Rewrites one function `NativeWalker::DecodeInstructionForPatchSkip()`.

The implicit ref is removed in either of these cases:\r\n      - The mutex gets another reference from within the same process\r\n      - The thread that owns the lock exits and abandons the mutex, at which point that would be the last reference to the mutex and the process would not reference the mutex anymore\r\n  - The implementation based on file locks is less restricted, but for consistency that implementation also follows the same behavior\r\n- There was also a race between an exiting thread abandoning one of its locked named mutexes and another thread releasing the last reference to it, fixed by using the creation/deletion process lock to synchronize\r\n\r\nFix for https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/34271 in 3.1\r\n\r\n### Customer impact\r\n\r\n- Random crashes were seen on Unixes\r\n- When a named mutex is locked and the last reference to it is released from a different thread in any process, the underlying pthread mutex object is destroyed and that has undefined behavior.

Since the non-collectible assemblies LoaderAllocator is never\r\ndestroyed, the handles were never cleaned up and so no problem could occur.\r\nIt was introduced in https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/21737\r\n\r\n ## Testing\r\nCustomer affected by the issue heavily has tested a fixed version and\r\nreported the issue doesn't occur anymore.\r\n\r\n ## Risk\r\nLow, the new code is executed at single place once per process runtine\r\nonly when a thread races for allocating the GC handle with another one\r\nand loses the race.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28025","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Port to 3.1: Fix allocation of RuntimeTypeCache GC handle\" (#28025)"},{"Id":"569148773","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-25T20:35:59","Actor":"hoyosjs","Number":"28023","RawContent":null,"Title":"[3.1 port] Fix debugger crash during unload of assemblies in ALC","State":"closed","Body":"Issue dotnet/runtime#2317 reports that trying to use unloadable ALCs under the debugger often ends up in a crash. There was a missing implementation when removing values from the module cache which in turn triggered a sporadic bad error in the DAC\r\n\r\nThis has already been fixed in .NET 5 (see dotnet/runtime#32311). This PR ports that fix down to _release/3.1_.\r\n\r\nFixes dotnet/runtime#2317\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\nInner loop get's heavily impacted for plugin scenarios. From dotnet/runtime#2317 \r\n> Developing/using the use cases that where described in the .net core announcement under [Assembly Unloadability](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-0) is slowed down as it is not possible to debug any scenario that requires assembly unloading. Without this fix the application must be restarted or tested without a debugger attached. This makes plugin development very annoying and less attractive.\r\n\r\nAlso see https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/698374/vs2019-and-fatal-error-has-occurred-and-debugging.html\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\nNot a regression. Unloadable ALC's were introduced in the 3.0/3.1 time-frame as a new feature. However, adoption is cumbersome on inner loop due to this. \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nThere's currently work in flight to add ALCs and unloadability verification for debugger scenarios. \r\n\r\n## Risk\r\nLow. The only code path that reaches this is exactly the one that's getting fixed and that still has somewhat low adoption. \r\n\r\n## Code Reviewer\r\n@sdmaclea ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28023","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[3.1 port] Fix debugger crash during unload of assemblies in ALC\" (#28023)"},{"Id":"587357484","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-25T18:36:02","Actor":"Anipik","Number":"28030","RawContent":null,"Title":"update branding for coreclr to 3.1.4","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28030","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"update branding for coreclr to 3.1.4\" (#28030)"},{"Id":"587368335","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-25T15:48:19","Actor":"Anipik","Number":"28031","RawContent":null,"Title":"update branding for 2.1.18","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28031","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"update branding for 2.1.18\" (#28031)"},{"Id":"580315472","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-13T01:29:34","Actor":"sdmaclea","Number":"28027","RawContent":null,"Title":"Port Cross OS DAC to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This represents the changes required to enable Cross OS/Arch DAC for the 3.1 product.

An unknown status string causes a CryptographicException to be thrown due to the missing mappings.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to correctly handle these additional statuses, mapping them such that the behavior matches what Windows and Linux do.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nInitially reported by a customer in dotnet/runtime#35238. Customers that attempt to build an `X509Chain` on macOS with a certificate that causes one of the unknown statuses to be triggered will receive a `CryptographicException` instead of the `X509ChainStatusFlags` which other platforms correctly report.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.  Ratios greater than 1 mean the benchmark performed worse with the JCC microcode update applied.\r\n - Y: Count of benchmarks in the bucket.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210322/80840714-ba0bda80-8bb2-11ea-8869-07ec55182661.png)\r\n**While there are some outliers, for the most part, the benchmarks are clustered around a ratio of 1 with the most benchmarks in the 1.038 – 1.085 bucket, which represents single digit percentage degradation.**","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\" (#153)"},{"Id":"583170428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-17T17:16:09","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"152","RawContent":null,"Title":"March 2020 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on March 2020.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

That means that .NET Core manifest tags are no longer usable on those Windows versions.\r\n\r\nIf you pull a manifest tag on one of the Windows versions described, you may get one of the following error messages:\r\n\r\n* `a Windows version 10.0.18362-based image is incompatible with a 10.0.17134 host`\r\n* `no matching manifest for windows/amd64 in the manifest list entries`\r\n* `no matching manifest for unknown in the manifest list entries`\r\n\r\nIf you need to still use Nano Server, version 1803 images (even though it is no longer supported), you will need to use tags that include the Nano Server version (these are non-manifest tags), for example `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:3.0-nanoserver-1803`.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/140","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Windows Server, version 1803 no longer supported by .NET Core\" (#140)"},{"Id":"522994983","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T17:15:08","Actor":"leecow","Number":"139","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3","State":"open","Body":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3 is available and https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/3809 has been opened for discussion.\r\n\r\n[Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/preview/3.1.0-preview3.md)\r\n[Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n\r\n**Blog posts**\r\n\r\n[.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n[ASP.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues you find with .NET Core 3.1 Preview 3, either responding to this issue, creating a new issue or creating a new issue in one of the following repos:\r\n\r\n* [aspnet/Home](https://github.com/aspnet/Home) - for ASP.NET Core questions\r\n* [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore) - for Entity Framework Core questions\r\n* [dotnet/cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues) - for CLI tools and questions\r\n* [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues) - for API issues and questions\r\n* [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues) - for runtime issues\r\n* [dotnet/core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues) - for installer issues\r\n* [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues) - for Winforms issues\r\n* [dotnet/wpf](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues) - for WPF issues\r\n* [nuget/home](https://github.com/nuget/home/issues) - for NuGet questions and issues\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/139","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3\" (#139)"},{"Id":"522864668","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T13:37:28","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"138","RawContent":null,"Title":"November 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on November 2019.

Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/133","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Repository Consolidation Timeline\" (#133)"},{"Id":"513963125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:55","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"132","RawContent":null,"Title":"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

With [.NET Standard 2.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-0/), we tried to make it much more viable to share code between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin which resulted in approximately 38K .NET Frameworks APIs being available in .NET Core 2.0. We also built the [Windows Compatibility Pack](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/) which made another 21K .NET Framework APIs available to .NET Core, resulting in almost 60K additional APIs. And in .NET Core 3.0 we added WPF and WinForms, which increased the number of .NET Framework APIs ported to .NET Core to over 120k, which is more than half of all .NET Framework APIs.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth pointing out that we added about 62K APIs to .NET Core that don’t exist in .NET Framework. If we compare their total number of APIs, .NET Core has about 80% of the API surface of .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/66777114-f8db7c80-ee7c-11e9-9161-acfe1c491586.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWe announced that the [future of .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/) will be based on .NET Core. And at Build 2019, [Scott Hunter stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlO1utbB2GQ&t=54m20s) that AppDomains, remoting, Web Forms, WCF server, and Windows Workflow won’t be ported to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 3.0, we’re at the point where we’ve ported all technologies that are required for modern workloads, be that desktop apps, mobile apps, console apps, web sites, or cloud services. That’s not to say that we don’t have any gaps or opportunities for new technologies, but we generally believe we won’t be finding them in the .NET Framework code base anymore. Moving forward, we’re focusing our resources on incorporating new technologies.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, we’re looking into releasing more of the [.NET Framework code base under the MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource) on GitHub to allow the community to create OSS projects for technologies we’re not intending to bring to .NET Core. For example, there already are community projects for [CoreWF](https://github.com/UiPath/corewf) and [CoreWCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF).\r\n\r\nWe’d like to thank everyone who filed issues with requests for APIs being ported. Those issues allowed us to prioritize and close the gaps that prevented people from porting to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nBut since we generally no longer plan to bring existing technologies from .NET Framework to .NET Core we’ll be closing all issues that are [labeled with port-to-core](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aport-to-core).\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this issue, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/41769.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/130","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 3.0 concludes the .NET Framework API porting project\" (#130)"},{"Id":"505445666","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-10T18:45:56","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"129","RawContent":null,"Title":"October 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on October 2019.

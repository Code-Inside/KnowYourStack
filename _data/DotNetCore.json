However, since COM isn't supported, these things don't work. Issue #4219 showed some examples and this [sample](https://github.com/kant2002/CoreRTWinFormsTestBed/tree/master/WinFormsComInterop) helped alot. However, when CoreRT'ing and starting the binary it failed. I think it's because I didn't follow step 6 as listed [here](https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/4219#issuecomment-623159691). I'm unsure what to do on that step. Can somebody guide me through what to do?

Since the CTR already knows with what token it's associated, allowing you to get the token from the CTR saves you from also needing to separately store the token, which lets you improve memory utilization by not carrying it around effectively twice.  We took advantage of that, for example, in FileStream's Read/WriteAsync operations, to decrease the size of the object allocated for those operations.  However, the CTR.Token property is incorrectly throwing an ObjectDisposedException if the associated CancellationTokenSource has been disposed, which introduces an ODE where there wasn't previously one (just accessing a CancellationToken you already had stored).  This is causing regressions in code that created a token source, registered with its token, and then disposed the source.\r\n\r\n#### Customer Impact\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\nExceptions on background threads that crash the process when performing operations like:\r\n```C#\r\nvar cts = new CancellationTokenSource();\r\nTask<int> t = fileStream.ReadAsync(..., cts.Token);\r\ncts.Dispose();\r\nint result = await t;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe fixed this in 2.2 but so far held off on backporting to 2.1 pending more customer data since it's an LTS release. Since then we've had 2 more reports (see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/37641) most recently a customer that says:\r\n\r\n> It may take the rest of the year to reach 3.1. In the meantime our servers are crashing and clients are getting mad! I can only apologize to them, mitigate the issues as best as possible and then blame you for not updating an LTS version!\r\n\r\nSince the change is very low risk -- it's been in the product since 2.2 -- we are proposing we now backport to 2.1\r\n\r\n#### Regression?\r\n\r\nYes.  It's not a regression in CancellationTokenRegistration.Token, which was only introduced in 2.1, but rather a regression in that it's behavior isn't matching code it was used to replace, so it's for example a regression in FileStream.Read/WriteAsync.\r\n\r\n#### Packaging reviewed? \r\n\r\nChange affects System.Private.CoreLib only.\r\n\r\n#### Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

A usage pattern that worsens this leak is to start tracing, fill up all the buffers, then stop tracing, and repeat that many times. This fix mitigates the issue by making EventPipeBuffer to use ClrVirtualAlloc instead of malloc.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\nOn Linux platforms (specifically ones that use glibc), customers may see an unexpected growth in the native heap size over a long period of time if using EventPipe for a long time (ex. using Application Insights Service Profiler), making our first-party and third-party tracing solutions potentially problematic in production scenarios when used for elongated periods of time.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\nNo, EventPipe buffers were always allocated using malloc.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nThe fix was tested against the scenario the customer provided and . Additional performance tests that use EventPipe showed minimal performance regression (<4 % in the worst case). \r\n\r\n## Risk\r\nI believe the risk is low - the fix is localized to only 3-lines change and the behavior is well-understood. I have tested the fix locally for the past three weeks for various performance measurements and the fix passed all the runtime tracing tests that I ran locally and all the tests in the CI when I merged https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/35924.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28038","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Port to 3.1 - Fix a native memory leak in EventPipe\" (#28038)"},{"Id":"617035823","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-13T16:47:30","Actor":"Anipik","Number":"28040","RawContent":null,"Title":"update branding to 3.1.5","State":"closed","Body":"- no darc feed to remove","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28040","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"update branding to 3.1.5\" (#28040)"},{"Id":"616421797","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-12T07:18:54","Actor":"kouvel","Number":"28039","RawContent":null,"Title":"[3.1] Fix Unix named mutex crash during some race conditions","State":"open","Body":"Port of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/36268 to 3.1\r\n\r\nBelow when I refer to \"mutex\" I'm referring to the underlying mutex object, not an instance of the `Mutex` class.\r\n- When the last reference to a mutex is closed while the lock is held by some thread and a pthread mutex is used, the mutex was attempted to be destroyed but that has undefined behavior\r\n- There doesn't seem to be a way to behave exactly like on Windows for this corner case, where the mutex is destroyed when the last reference to it is released, regardless of which process has the mutex locked and which process releases the last reference to it (they could be two different processes), including in cases of abrupt shutdown\r\n- For this corner case I settled on what seems like a decent solution and compatible with older runtimes:\r\n  - When a process releases its last reference to the mutex\r\n    - If that mutex is locked by the same thread, the lock is abandoned and the process no longer references the mutex\r\n    - If that mutex is locked by a different thread, the lifetime of the mutex is extended with an implicit ref. The implicit ref prevents this or other processes from attempting to destroy the mutex while it is locked. The implicit ref is removed in either of these cases:\r\n      - The mutex gets another reference from within the same process\r\n      - The thread that owns the lock exits and abandons the mutex, at which point that would be the last reference to the mutex and the process would not reference the mutex anymore\r\n  - The implementation based on file locks is less restricted, but for consistency that implementation also follows the same behavior\r\n- There was also a race between an exiting thread abandoning one of its locked named mutexes and another thread releasing the last reference to it, fixed by using the creation/deletion process lock to synchronize\r\n\r\nFix for https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/34271 in 3.1\r\n\r\n### Customer impact\r\n\r\n- Random crashes were seen on Unixes\r\n- When a named mutex is locked and the last reference to it is released from a different thread in any process, the underlying pthread mutex object is destroyed and that has undefined behavior. Crashes were seen where some data associated with the destroyed pthread mutex continues to be used when acquiring another pthread mutex in racy situations, causing a crash because the memory containing the destroyed pthread mutex is unmapped.\r\n- There was also a race where a thread has acquired the lock of a named mutex, between that thread exiting and abandoning the mutex, and another thread attempting to destroy the mutex\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- PAL named mutex tests on Linux and OSX including in stress mode (1 hour) in debug and release\r\n- System.Threading tests including mutex tests on Linux and OSX with debug and release coreclr\r\n- PAL, coreclr, and libraries tests\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow:\r\n- It is a bit of a corner case, where a lock is acquired and the mutex is disposed without releasing the lock, especially necessary for this issue is that the thread that disposes the mutex is different from the one that holds the lock\r\n- Since the fix involves extending the lifetime of a mutex in such a case, the underlying shared named mutex may observably live longer than before. That is necessary for correctness, as the behavior there was incorrect before and leading to the crashes.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28039","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[3.1] Fix Unix named mutex crash during some race conditions\" (#28039)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"CLI-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"658389526","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-22T23:00:25","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"13438","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/3.1.1xx' => 'release/3.1.2xx'","State":"closed","Body":"I detected changes in the release/3.1.1xx branch which have not been merged yet to release/3.1.2xx.

On Linux-based environments, customers that explicitly or implicitly use `X509Chain` to build a certificate that cause an AIA fetch and the server improperly responds successfully but with empty content will cause a null pointer dereference in native code, which will result in an unrecoverable hard crash of the runtime.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nYes. Prior to .NET Core 3.0, a managed exception was thrown instead of an access violation.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThe original fix against dotnet/runtime contains a unit test to prevent further regressions. The test is not ported here due to missing testing faculties for AIA fetching.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n**Low**. The fix is to treat empty responses or any other response that results in a certificate with an invalid handle as an invalid response.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42942","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Ignore 0-byte responses from AIA fetch.\" (#42942)"},{"Id":"643406701","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-14T23:09:15","Actor":"cheenamalhotra","Number":"42937","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Release 3.1] Avoid enlistment of pooled connection in aborted transaction","State":"closed","Body":"Ports https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/551 and https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/543 to System.Data.SqlClient.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nFixes issue https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues/237 that occurs due to driver enlisting pooled connection in stale transaction which is due abort from SysTx.Transactions on the server. This incorrect enlistment causes server to perform forth-coming operations in implicit mode, causing unwanted commits.\r\n\r\nThe fix ensures if a transaction gets aborted externally, the corresponding connection is not sent back to the pool.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n**High** This bug causes the driver to perform commits outside transaction even though client is presumably working inside a transaction. It qualifies for a security issue.\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\nNo, this issue is reproducible with all SqlClient drivers.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis issue has not yet been reproduced in .NET Core applications but the driver behavior being same to that of .NET Framework needs to be fixed. The issue happens intermittently and is more likely to happen on SQL Server machines working in heavy load.

The Team had it already running with Mono but was not satisfied with the overall performances. Therefore I was tasked with checking if the performances can be improved or finding an alternative to using Mono. \r\n\r\nAs getting CoreRT working on the XBox was an very easy task I was able to get the core module of our C# code run in a few hours. As it runs more than twice as fast compared to Mono it was decided to go ahead. PlayStation was a little bit more work but it worked after a few days and showed the same performances improvements. Unfortunately while goingon to the Switch I noticed that the ARM64 support was incomplete and using ARM was not an option because of some limitations on the target system. As the team still wanted the performances improvements I started to implement the missing parts. It took some time but I was able to get our test case running and again it was more than twice as fast as the Mono version. It does not use all .Net features therefore there are still parts missing. But as our test test case (around 5MB of C# code) was able to run for hours with the precise GC I assume it is at least a big part.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately priorities changed and this project was put on hold. After things have changed again it was decided to give a switch from Mono to CoreRT a second try. This time I although got the permission to submit anything that does not touch the various NDAs. As you might assume I needed to add code on different places including the jit itself. As anything was done on a now nearly one year old version I need to reintegrate all these changes again. But I'd like to make sure they can easily go back in the main code branch. \r\n\r\nTherefore the question on which of these changes you are interested in and what's your recommended work flow?\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/8236","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ARM64 and cross compile support\" (#8236)"},{"Id":"658291999","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-16T15:29:50","Actor":"ogxd","Number":"8234","RawContent":null,"Title":"Link error 1181 when building the NativeLibrary sample as a shared library","State":"closed","Body":"I just cloned the repository.\r\n\r\nThe C# dll builds fine, but then when I try to compile it as a shared library using : \r\n`dotnet publish /p:NativeLib=Shared -r win-x64 -c Release`\r\n\r\nIt throws the following exception : \r\n`LINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file 'kernel32.lib' [...\\corert\\samples\\NativeLibrary\\NativeLibrary.csproj]\r\n...\\.nuget\\packages\\microsoft.dotnet.ilcompiler\\1.0.0-alpha-29116-02\\build\\Microsoft.NETCore.Native.targets(310,5): error MSB3073: The command \"link  @\"obj\\Release\\netstandard2.0\\win-x64\\native\\link.rsp\"\" exited with code 1181.

(For a full context of why we need that, please refer to the gitter conversation, or feel free to contact me directly)\r\n\r\nThanks to all the great work that's already been done via LLVM for wasm, perhaps the project wouldn't be as crazy as I immediately think.\r\n\r\nWith help from @MichalStrehovsky and @yowl, and based on Michal's zerosharp code, I got a tiny little no-corelib Hello world to compile via LLVM an x86 Mac executable:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corert/compare/master...christianscheuer:macllvm\r\n\r\nTo test it, make sure to install the prerequisites (it needs llvm 10.0 and the MacOS 10.13 SDK installed, see the README for more info), then build CoreRT in Debug and skip the tests: `./build.sh skiptests`, then go into the `tests/src/llvm` directory and run `./build.sh`.\r\nIt will run CSC to compile to IL, run the modified ILC from the repo to compile to bitcode (which uses the WebAssembly LLVM backend with some hardcoded modifications) - and then use the installed LLVM 10 linker (it needs to be the same major version of LLVM that's used to produce the bitcode, and we're using libLLVM 10 to produce the bitcode) to produce a runnable executable. It then runs it, it prints Hello world and returns 42 :)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nNow all of this raises a bunch of questions it would be great to get your input to.\r\n\r\n- Assuming that we would be going down this path, I expect the first step would be to look at how to refactor the WebAssembly backend so that a new, generic ILToLLVMImporter can be created as a base class, and have ILToWebAssemblyImporter inherit from that, as well as other derived classes for the new x86, x64, arm64 targets (or, some other structure). For example, I suspect many opcode importers, stack management etc. should be the same no matter if the \"architecture\" is wasm or x64 (accounting for different pointer sizes), so there should be a lot of code that can be reused. Things like the shadow stack however I don't think we'll need for anything but wasm, if I understand the reasons behind it correctly, so there would be a challenge to see how to structure the code so both a shadow stack based and regular stack based version can coexist.\r\nSo the question is - with all of this in mind: How would you approach code structuring of such an endeavor?\r\nObviously we can do a clean copy-paste into a different directory, but I thought the two implementations could benefit from each other if they were linked...\r\n\r\n- Overall engineering plan\r\nWhat would be the best way to approach the rest of the bringup, once that initial refactor has been done? What would be the best order of x64-ifying it (ie. add support for 8 byte pointer sizes, potentially remove the shadow stack, etc.)\r\nAny other considerations?\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/8230","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Investigating LLVM as a general backend for x86, x64 and arm64 code generation\" (#8230)"},{"Id":"656116271","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-14T06:41:21","Actor":"MichalStrehovsky","Number":"8228","RawContent":null,"Title":"Collapse MetadataWriter into MetadataTransform","State":"closed","Body":"The original reason why these were split is to make it possible to share the writer with the .NET Native compiler.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files. But now you can enhance your localized Visual Studio development experience by adding the localized IntelliSense files from the download site into your local development environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, with this release we have made the localized IntelliSense available as zip archives that does require you to manually extract and copy the files to respective SDK install folders.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/133","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Repository Consolidation Timeline\" (#133)"},{"Id":"513963125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:55","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"132","RawContent":null,"Title":"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

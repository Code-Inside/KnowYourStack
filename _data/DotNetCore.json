I'd written this off as being a local configuration issue related to uninstalling .NET 10 SDK Preview 7. Once it reproduced in Actions, I changed my belief to be that there is a compatibility issue, as the Actions agent has never had .NET 10 installed before I installed it during setup.\n\n<details><summary>dotnet --info</summary>\n\nFor the broken build:\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107\n Commit:            2db1f5ee2b\n Workload version:  10.0.100-manifests.1a2d104c\n MSBuild version:   17.15.0-preview-25451-107+2db1f5ee2\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.26100\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107\\\n\n.NET workloads installed:\n [maui-windows]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36414.22\n   Manifest Version:    10.0.0-preview.6.25359.8/10.0.100-preview.6\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\10.0.100-preview.6\\microsoft.net.sdk.maui\\10.0.0-preview.6.25359.8\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:        FileBased\n\n [maccatalyst]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36414.22\n   Manifest Version:    18.5.10415-net10-p6/10.0.100-preview.6\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\10.0.100-preview.6\\microsoft.net.sdk.maccatalyst\\18.5.10415-net10-p6\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:        FileBased\n\n [ios]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36414.22\n   Manifest Version:    18.5.10415-net10-p6/10.0.100-preview.6\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\10.0.100-preview.6\\microsoft.net.sdk.ios\\18.5.10415-net10-p6\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:        FileBased\n\n [android]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36414.22\n   Manifest Version:    36.0.0-preview.6.169/10.0.100-preview.6\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\10.0.100-preview.6\\microsoft.net.sdk.android\\36.0.0-preview.6.169\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:        FileBased\n\n [wasm-tools]\n   Installation Source: VS 17.14.36414.22\n   Manifest Version:    10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107/10.0.100\n   Manifest Path:       C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk-manifests\\10.0.100\\microsoft.net.workload.mono.toolchain.current\\10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107\\WorkloadManifest.json\n   Install Type:        FileBased\n\nConfigured to use workload sets when installing new manifests.\nNo workload sets are installed.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key.

Since a more specific error (ERR_OmittedTypeArgument) is already reported, the confusing errors with `?` symbols are redundant.\n\n### Changes Made\n1. **OverloadResolutionResult.cs**: Modified `HadReturnMismatch` to suppress ERR_BadRetType when return type contains error types\n2. **Conversions.cs**: Added check in `ReportDelegateOrFunctionPointerMethodGroupDiagnostics` to mark as having errors when candidate methods have error types in return type or parameters, preventing ERR_MethDelegateMismatch from being reported as a fallback\n3. **BindingTests.cs**: \n   - Updated test expectations for return type case to remove the now-suppressed ERR_BadRetType diagnostic\n   - Added new test `MissingTypeArgumentInGenericExtensionMethod_ParameterType` to verify parameter types are also handled correctly\n\n### Result\n**Before (return type):**\n```\nerror CS8389: Omitting the type argument is not allowed in the current context\nerror CS0407: '?

On my local workstation (Fedora), if I perform a single successful publish _without_ these flags, any subsequent publishes _with_ the flags succeed. This remains true even after deleting the entire project directory and re-cloning the repository. I have verified this on two separate Fedora workstations.\n\nMy suspicion is that Ubuntu would behave similarly if state were preserved, but GitHub runners of course provide a clean environment each time.\n\nThis suggests that something outside the project directory is being modified after the first successful publish, though I have absolutely no idea what that might be?\n\nOr maybe I’ve just made two faulty observations. :)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/51766","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Publish with `--no-build --no-restore` fails when using AOT in .NET 10\" (#51766)"},{"Id":"3629118400","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-15T19:10:31","Actor":"baronfel","Number":"51765","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ensure that Trimming and AOT scenarios trigger downloading of necessary runtime packs","State":"open","Body":"Fixes dotnet/runtime#51667\r\n\r\nThere was a gap when restoring a project for a RID and then publishing it for that same RID with `--no-restore` where if that project only set PublishTrimmed or PublishAOT, the runtime packs for that RID would not be restored.

Please describe.\n\nToday folks that want to use nightly builds of the SDK (or even use the redist build here from the repo, etc) face two fundamental problems:\n\n* getting the bits\n* getting the bits configured with the correct feeds so that our long-tail of NuGet-package-delivered functionality lights up\n  * this is things like workloads, self-contained publishing, trimming, AOT, single-file hosts, apphosts, etc\n\nToday, the 'get the bits' problem is at least somewhat mitigated by\n\n* the dotnet/dotnet VMR [builds table](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/main/docs/builds-table.md)\n* the dotnet-install scripts nightly feeds\n* the internal release-tracker tool (for private builds, security release previews, and so on)\n\nIn the future, some people (it's me, I'm the people) would like SDK PRs to generate bundles that would be usable for testing/validation purposes - but that's just an expansion of the VMR use case for the purposes of this discussion.\n\nRegardless of how users _get_ the bits, they need to do additional NuGet feed configuration in order for all of our implicit PackageReferences and PackageDownloads to work.  This often hits Visual Studio dogfooders when we insert an unreleased SDK into VS ahead of public release for overall alignment purposes.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThe actual goal is **the SDK bits you download should be able to access a pre-configured feed, and that feed should be configured to only server/impact the use of the .NET SDK's implicit PackageReferences/PackageDownloads**\n\nOne implementation towards this goal could be:\n\n* expanding the compositional lookup hierarchy of the NuGet.config file today from \"machine, then user, then solution/repo\" to \"machine, then toolchain, then user, then solution/repo\"\n  * essentially allowing the .NET SDK layout/install a place to influence source configuration/resolution\n  * this would need design and agreement from the @dotnet/nuget-team, naturally, though it may provide a more 'official' or 'natural' way for concepts like the Visual Studio fallback feed to be configured.\n  * 'toolchain' for the dotnet CLI environment would be the SDK install root, and for the VS environment would be some other location that VS installations can control. there should be a design/agreement around this.\n* making the SDK build process (in the SDK repo, and then eventually in the VMR) emit a NuGet.config file that specifies\n  * the correct package source(s) that serve every implicitly-used package the SDK toolchain may insert into a project's dependency hierarchy\n  * package source mapping entries to ensure those implicitly-used packages are only served from those preconfigured feeds\n* depending on the usage of the SDK in question (SDK repo PR build, VMR nightly, final stable release, VS insertion), the generate NuGet.config may or may not be included in the actual SDK layout:\n  * SDK repo PR build: included\n  * VMR nightly build: included\n  * final stable release before public release: not included, but generated and easily gettable? maybe by tooling?\n  * final stable release (or servicing previews): not included\n  * VS insertion (of stable releases or servicing releases): not included in the SDK, but could potentially be included as a component?\n\n### Contents of the generated NuGet.config\n\nAn SDK manipulates the following kinds of packages that should be sourced from the non-NuGet.org feeds in this scenario\n \n* workload packs\n* workload manifests\n* runtime packs\n* targeting packs\n* actual NuGet packages\n\nMany of these have a well-known set of name patterns or are knowable statically, so we should be able to relatively easily know which feed(s) they should be sourced from.\n\nLet's consider a single pack - the `linux-x64` AppHosts pack `Microsoft.NETCore.App.Host.linux-x64` across net8/9/10 TFMs across the scenarios above:\n\n| scenario | TFM | feed |\n| - | - | - |\n| SDK PR | NET10 | dotnet-10 |\n| SDK PR | NET9 | dotnet-9 |\n| SDK PR | NET8 | dotnet-8 |\n| VMR nightly | NET10 | dotnet-10 |\n| VMR nightly | NET9 | dotnet-9 |\n| VMR nightly | NET8 | dotnet-8 |\n| Stable release prior to public | NET10 | release-specific dotnet-10 prep feed |\n| Stable release prior to public | NET9 | release-specific dotnet-9 prep feed |\n| Stable release prior to public| NET8 | release-specific dotnet-8 prep feed |\n| Stable release | NET10 | N/A - defer entirely to user config |\n| Stable release | NET9 | N/A - defer entirely to user config|\n| Stable release | NET8 | N/A - defer entirely to user config|\n| VS Insertion of unreleased | NET10 | release-specific dotnet-10 prep feed |\n| VS Insertion of unreleased | NET9 | release-specific dotnet-9 prep feed |\n| VS Insertion of unreleased | NET8 | release-specific dotnet-8 prep feed |\n\nThis is _highly_ pattern-based and would be fairly easy to template out and generate during the build. \n\nThe generated NuGet.config would look something like:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<configuration>\n    <packageSources>\n        <clear />\n        <add key=\"dotnet-10\" value=\"https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_packaging/dotnet10/nuget/v3/index.json\" />\n        <add key=\"dotnet-9\" value=\"https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_packaging/dotnet9/nuget/v3/index.json\" />\n        ...\n    </packageSources>\n\n  <packageSourceMapping>\n      <packageSource key=\"dotnet-10\">\n        <package pattern=\"Microsoft.NETCore.App.Host.linux-x64\" />\n      </packageSource>\n      <packageSource key=\"dotnet-9\">\n        <package pattern=\"Microsoft.NETCore.App.Host.linux-x64\" />\n      </packageSource>\n      ...\n    </packageSourceMapping>\n</configuration>\n```\n\nBy explicitly mapping the packages the SDK will automatically provide, we limit the scope of usage of these feeds in whatever end-user configurations that may exist.\n\nThe thinking here is that for the most painful use cases today we can actually know what the correct feeds are - and potentially with some release tracker work we can also make the NuGet.config for the stable-but-not-yet-released SDKs more easily usable by internal partners.\n\n### Open Questions\n\n#### Template packages\n\nProblem: @DamianEdwards brings up templates that we ship and how those often include PackageReferences that would also need to be updated.\n\nSolution: Add mapping entries for Microsoft.* and System.* to the generated config as well. For PRs/Nightlies these would probably point to `dotnet-libraries` and/or `dotnet-tools`, and for internals we'd point to the per-release dedicated feeds. This makes it more important that we use explicit packageId mapping entries for the runtime packs, workloads, etc so that we don't reintroduce dependency confusion.\n\n#### Global package directory dirtying\n\nProblem: These nuget.configs would introduce package versions that aren't available on end-user package sources to the global package cache. That could cause confusion if users switch between preview/nightly SDKs and stable SDKs for their 'real' work.\n\nSolution: generated nuget.configs should use a separate global packages cache to prevent this dirtying.\n\n### Drawbacks\n\n* NuGet.config location would need expansion.\n* NuGet.config allows removal of package sources (and maybe PSM data? need clarification on that), so it's possible and maybe even likely that the generated config would still conflict with user repo configurations. That's ok though - users that customize their repo NuGet configuration should be able to navigate this, and we can doc the behavior/experience.\n* It would force us to reconcile with the set of packages we work with implicitly\n  * this is actually a benefit, though - we _should_ know this and track it","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/51764","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"It should be easier to effectively use unreleased builds of the .NET SDK\" (#51764)"},{"Id":"3628911936","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-15T16:24:25","Actor":"DamianEdwards","Number":"51763","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add code fixer to apply opinionated sort of #: directives in file-based apps","State":"open","Body":"File-based apps support the following directives:\n\n- `#:sdk`\n- `#:property`\n- `#:project`\n- `#:package`\n\nThese can be placed in any order at the top of the file.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.17  Runtime or .NET 8.0.314 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.6  Runtime or .NET 9.0.107 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

Build the solution in `Release` mode, then use a developer command prompt to navigate into the output directory and open the built DLL using _ILDASM_.: `ildasm.exe ClassLibrary1.dll`.\r\n5.

The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

Inside Visual Studio, create a new C# `Class Library (.NET Framework)` project.  The type of C# project isn't too important, this is just used for simplicity.\r\n2. Replace the contents of `Class1.cs` with the following code:\r\n```cs\r\nnamespace ClassLibrary1\r\n{\r\n    static class Settings\r\n    {\r\n        public static bool IsSpecialMode\r\n        {\r\n            get\r\n            {\r\n                #if SPECIAL_FLAG\r\n                    return true;\r\n                #else\r\n                    return false;\r\n                #endif\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class Class1\r\n    {\r\n        public string DoSomething()\r\n        {\r\n            if (Settings.IsSpecialMode) {return \"Doing something SPECIAL.\";}\r\n            else                        {return \"Doing something.\";}\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n4. Build the solution in `Release` mode, then use a developer command prompt to navigate into the output directory and open the built DLL using _ILDASM_.: `ildasm.exe ClassLibrary1.dll`.\r\n5. Navigate down to the `DoSomething()` method and double-click it to bring up the IL.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/assets/1672416/b2f19d7a-234b-496e-934b-107c3955e9ae)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\nIt's my understanding that the `Optimize+` compiler flag removes unreachable code.  Based on whether `SPECIAL_FLAG` is defined, the `Settings.IsSpecialMode` property will always return either `true` or `false`.  As a result of this, there is only a single code path the `DoSomething()` method can ever execute.  It is expected here that the generated IL would reflect this.  Only one string should be seen in the IL.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\nBoth strings can be seen in the IL.  Even though one block of the `if` statement in the `DoSomething()` method is unreachable, both blocks are always kept around by the compiler.\r\n\r\n**Remarks**\r\nThe code above was kept simple for demonstration purposes, but either block of the `if` statement could contain thousands of lines of code.  The compiler should be smart enough to detect this and remove the unreachable code.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the idea behind the code above is that a production build should not define `SPECIAL_FLAG`, and all the special code associated with that flag should be compiled out of the final assembly.  Because the unreachable code is not being removed by the compiler, it can still be viewed and coerced into being executed by someone.  The intermediate `IsSpecialMode` property is used to avoid having to clutter the codebase with preprocessor directives.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/68929","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Optimize+ doesn't seem to fully discard all unreachable code\" (#68929)"},{"Id":"1794507309","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-07T22:52:43","Actor":"cston","Number":"68930","RawContent":null,"Title":"Collection literals: collection builder methods","State":"open","Body":"See [proposals/collection-literals.md#create-methods](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/main/proposals/collection-literals.md#create-methods).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/68930","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Collection literals: collection builder methods\" (#68930)"},{"Id":"1792311980","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-07T20:27:12","Actor":"333fred","Number":"68902","RawContent":null,"Title":"Don't hardcode C# 9 in function pointer tests","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/68835.\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/68902","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Don't hardcode C# 9 in function pointer tests\" (#68902)"},{"Id":"1794226608","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-07T20:22:22","Actor":"jcouv","Number":"68928","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge latest bits from `main` into `roles` feature branch","State":"open","Body":"The last commit resolves the conflicts","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/68928","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Merge latest bits from `main` into `roles` feature branch\" (#68928)"},{"Id":"1794170063","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-07T19:58:53","Actor":"cston","Number":"68927","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support inline arrays with collection literals","State":"open","Body":"- Allow inline array types as target types for collection literals.\r\n- Allow inline arrays as spread elements.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/68927","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support inline arrays with collection literals\" (#68927)"},{"Id":"1794042617","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-07-07T19:55:49","Actor":"allisonchou","Number":"68925","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Infra] Publish 17.8 P1 VS PRs","State":"closed","Body":"Takes 17.8 P1 PRs out of draft mode.

I have tried hard to wrap my head about this by reading many issues and studying existing packages. I have a particular need that is similar to `TorchSharp` with massive native libraries that not only need to be split into fragments but also where if possible it would be best only to \"download\" the runtime identifier (RID) specific packages needed for local development. (But on windows that local development often means BOTH x86 and x64 in our case).\r\n\r\nBelow I wrote a walk-through I did of using `ClangSharp` (in excessive detail for reference) and the many questions that it raised for me compared to how I am used to working with this (based on our own way of authoring native library packages that are explicitly copied to sub-directories (`x64`, `x86`) alongside `exe` and with those directories then added at runtime based on the process arch/os/system to dll directories i.e. via [`AddDllDirectory`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-adddlldirectory). Having something \"custom\" is a maintenance issue of course, but also an on-boarding issue. Using documented best practices would be best, but as far as I can tell there are none?\r\n\r\nIn any case, at the end of the walk-through I encounter the problem that when specifying multiple RIDs i.e.\r\n```\r\n<RuntimeIdentifiers>win-x64;win-x86</RuntimeIdentifiers>\r\n```\r\nthen the `runtime.json` trick does not appear to work when running unit tests from inside Visual Studio. I have to explicitly add the RID specific nuget packages anyway, so I then wonder how exactly is one supposed to author nuget packages to be able to support running multiple RIDs (in this case solely interested in win-x86 and win-x64 for now) with full support for it as usual in VS and other tools? We need to be able to debug and run from VS?\r\n\r\nAnd how do you switch which RID you run with when F5 running in VS?\r\n\r\nShould I simply accept that the `runtime.json` way is too flawed and explicitly reference all needed nuget packages? Would this then avoid the need to specify RIDs? Which also has issues with \"forcing\" self-contained (we don't want that), in fact we'd like to simply be able to deploy/copy-paste build output as something like:\r\n```\r\nApp.exe\r\nwin-x64\\\r\n  // win-x64 specific native libraries\r\nwin-x86\\\r\n  // win-x86 specific native libraries\r\n```\r\nwhere the app is not RID specific (framework-dependent of course). And this should work on both win-x86/winx64. This is what we have now and what works. Our developers are used to this. But it's based on native library nuget packages that explicitly copy their native library contents to those folders and of course referencing all those RID specific ones. I had hoped perhaps one could avoid the RID specific referencing, but that does not seem to work \"smoothly\". Which I'd guess then means the whole `runtime.json` is not the way to go. \r\n\r\nSecondly, I think I read somewhere (can't find or remember where) that for .NET 8 it is considered to force a specific RID on build? I can see given my experience below why one might consider doing that, but that would then raise other issues such as losing what used to be a core tenant (IMHO) of .NET which is that a build output (not publish) is RID agnostic. Would that be lost then?\r\n\r\nAll in all, to solve these issues I have to author my own little tool for packaging the native libraries, consider all the issues around consumption, testing etc. And after going through all this I am still left with feeling rather lost ðŸ˜… I still don't know exactly what is the best solution here. And the packages I am creating are intended to be published for the public, e.g. so I can publish the revived CNTK packages I've made on nuget.org for example.\r\n\r\nOn top of this we still want to support publishing RID specific applications, but then we don't want native libraries embedded in single file, there is an option for that which is great, but then we want those dlls in sub-folder, not directly next to the `exe`, which means we have to hack around that in MSBuild and then face issues with mixed-mode assemblies etc. Yes, we also have those which also makes things very interesting. \r\n\r\nML/AI isn't going away. For each new CUDA or whatever release the native libraries double in size (minimum!). Easy authoring and consumption of those would be great, but I am sure also won't be solved in the immediate future, I need to know what to do now?\r\n\r\nThe walk-through will come as the next comment.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Links\r\n * \"[Feature] Increase the package size limit on NuGet.org from 250 MB\"\r\n   https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/9473\r\n   This features a discussion on how to split a nuget package and links.\r\n * TorchSharp -

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\n# Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\nBuilding the .NET product from individual product repos in the [dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet) organization is a complex process requiring orchestration infrastructure that is available only to Microsoft. This is a hindrance to the .NET community as it's currently not possible to easily reproduce the official product build in the open. Furthermore, the complexity of the official build and release infrastructure tends to grow over the years. This presents many reliability and sustainability challenges.  \r\n\r\nTo address the abovementioned issues, **we'd like to announce a new repository** - https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet - which is the first step on the way to simplify building and shipping of .NET and making the product build process transparent to and reproducible by the community.\r\n\r\nThis new repository is a **Virtual Monolithic Repository (VMR)**. It includes all the code needed to build the .NET SDK, mirrored from the individual product repos (such as [dotnet/roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) or [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime)). It also includes [source-build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build), our whole-product build system used to build .NET by our Linux partners.\r\n\r\nThe VMR has the following main characteristics:\r\n- **Monolithic** - The repository is monolithic so that a single commit fully identifies the whole source code necessary to build the .NET SDK\r\n- **Virtual** - It's a mirror (not a replacement) of the individual product repos that make up the whole product, placed side-by-side in one repository. Changes to the underlying individual product repositories are synchronized to the VMR.\r\n- **Experimental** - Currently, the repository is part of our initiative to streamline the release process, not meant to be depended on. We reserve the right to delete the current instance and create a new, different one in its stead. We expect the repository to be persistent by the release of .NET 8 Preview 1, planned for February, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe repository is a work-in-progress and has a lot of [limitations](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet#limitations) but we believe that even with these limitations it can be already useful in a variety of scenarios.\r\n\r\n## ðŸŽ¯ Goals of the Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\n- The main purpose of the [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet) repository is to have all source code necessary to build the .NET product available in one repository and identified by a single commit.\r\n- The VMR also aims to become the place from which we release and service future versions of .NET to reduce the complexity of the product construction process. This should allow our partners and and 3rd parties to easily build, test and modify .NET using their custom infrastructure as well as make the process available to the community.\r\n- Lastly, we hope to solve other problems that the current multi-repo setup brings:\r\n  -  Enable developers to make and test changes spanning multiple repositories.\r\n  -  Fulfill requirements of .NET distro builders such as RedHat or Canonical to natively include .NET in their distribution repositories.\r\n  - Simplify scenarios such as client-run testing of bug fixes and improvements. The build should work in an offline environment too for certain platforms.\r\n  - Enable the standard [down-/up-stream open-source model](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md).\r\n  - More efficient pipeline for security fixes during the CVE pre-disclosure process.\r\n\r\n## ðŸ“– Further reading\r\n\r\nIn case you are interested in knowing more about the why's and how's of VMR's purpose, design and architecture, you may find the following set of documents interesting:\r\n  - [VMR's Design and Operation](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Design-And-Operation.md)\r\n  - [Upstream/Downstream Relationships](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md)\r\n  - [Code and Build Workflow](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Code-And-Build-Workflow.md)\r\n  - [Strategy for Managing External Source Dependencies](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Strategy-For-External-Source.md)\r\n\r\nThe build of the VMR is made possible by the [.NET Source-Build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build).\r\n\r\n## ðŸ’¬ Discussion\r\n\r\nYou can share your thoughts on the VMR or see what others are saying at https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/11584\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/241","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\" (#241)"},{"Id":"1440663435","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-08T18:02:27","Actor":"dcwhittaker","Number":"240","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET November 2022 Updates","State":"open","Body":"Microsoft released the following [.NET Updates in November 2022](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/november-2022-updates/).\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Releases </h2>\r\n\r\n* [.NET 6.0.11 and .NET SDK 6.0.111](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.11/6.0.11.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0))\r\n* [.NET Core 3.1.31 and .NET SDK 3.1.425](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1.31/3.1.31.md)  ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1))\r\n\r\nThis issue will be updated if there are any additional releases during the month.\r\n\r\n## Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?\r\n\r\nYour app may be affected by many security vulnerabilities if you have not been installing .NET 6 patches. \r\n\r\n[Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/cve.md) makes it easy to tell how many CVEs affect your app, given the .NET 6 patch version you currently have deployed.\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Support Policies</h2>\r\nMicrosoft support policies are defined in the following documents:\r\n\r\n* [Currently Supported Releases](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md)\r\n* [Microsoft .NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/240","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET November 2022 Updates\" (#240)"},{"Id":"1440661312","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-08T18:01:14","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"239","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory  CVE 2022-41064 | .NET Information Disclosure Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory  CVE 2022-41064 | .NET Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET, .NET Core and .NET Framework's System.Data.SqlClient and Microsoft.Data.SqlClient NuGet Packages.\r\n\r\nA vulnerability exists in System.Data.SqlClient and Microsoft.Data.SqlClient libraries where a timeout occurring under high load can cause incorrect data to be returned as the result of an asynchronously executed query.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/78042\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nIf you are not talking to Microsoft SQL Server from your application you are not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-packages\"></a>Affected packages\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\n[System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient/) | <=4.8.4 | 4.8.5\r\n[Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient/) | <= 1.1.3, 2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.1.0, 2.1.1 | 1.1.4, >=2.1.2\r\n\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n.NET has two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. \r\n\r\nFor example, theâ€¯Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvcâ€¯package depends on theâ€¯Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Coreâ€¯package. When you add a dependency onâ€¯Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvcâ€¯in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency onâ€¯Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core. \r\n \r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on theâ€¯ [affected packages](#affected-packages) listed above are vulnerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n* If you are using System.Data.SqlClient on .NET Framework you must install the November update for .NET Framework\r\n* If you are using System.Data.SqlClient on .NET Core, .NET 5 or .NET 6 you must update the nuget package to an updated version as listed in the [affected packages](#affected-packages).\r\n* If you are using Microsoft.Data.SqlClient, anywhere (.NET Core, .NET 5/6, .NET Framework) and you are using a version that is vulnerable you must update as listed in the [affected packages](#affected-packages).\r\n\r\nIf you don't know the difference between Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient please read the [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient initial announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-the-new-microsoftdatasqlclient/)  for an explanation,\r\n\r\n**Additional Details**\r\n\r\n.NET and .NET Framework projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, .NET Framework users must also install the November 2022 security patch to be protected. \r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies \r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining yourâ€¯csprojâ€¯file. They can be fixed by editing the project file or using nuget command line to update the dependency. \r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies \r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. Transitive dependencies can be discovered by searching theâ€¯project.assets.jsonâ€¯file for each of your projects. This file is produced on each build and is in the obj directory for each project. \r\n\r\nTheâ€¯project.assets.json files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### Fixing direct dependencies \r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are nuget packages that have been specifically added to a project, rather than being pulled in because a nuget package added requires it. They can be seen in the solution explorer in Visual Studio or by opening the csproj for the project and examining the packageReference nodes for the package name, specified by the Include parameter, and its version, specified by the Version parameter.  \r\n\r\nFor example, the following project file has a direct dependency on version 2.1.1 of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. \r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"2.1.1\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project> \r\n```\r\n#### Fixing direct dependencies with the nuget command line \r\n\r\nOpen a command line to the directory holding your project \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you are using a version of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient between 2.0.0 and 2.1.1 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient --version 2.1.2 \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you are using a version of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient below 1.1.4 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient --version 1.1.4 \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you are using a version of System.Data.SqlClient below 4.8.4 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package System.Data.SqlClient --version 4.8.5 \r\n\r\n#### Fixing direct dependencies by editing the project file \r\n\r\nOpenâ€¯projectname.csprojâ€¯in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and chooseâ€¯Edit projectname.csprojâ€¯from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.  \r\n\r\nLook forâ€¯PackageReferenceâ€¯elements. The following shows an example project file: \r\n\r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"2.1.1\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project> \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference tone of the vulnerable packages as seen by the singleâ€¯PackageReferenceâ€¯element. The name of the package is in theâ€¯Includeâ€¯attribute. \r\nThe package version number is in theâ€¯Versionâ€¯attribute. \r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed in the Affected software section of this document. \r\n\r\nIn this example, updateâ€¯Microsoft.Data.SqlClient to the appropriate fixed version for your major version. Save theâ€¯csprojâ€¯file. The exampleâ€¯csprojâ€¯now looks as follows: \r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"2.1.2\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updatedâ€¯csprojâ€¯file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. \r\n\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening theâ€¯Outputâ€¯window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing theâ€¯Show output fromâ€¯drop-down list toâ€¯Package Manager. \r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute theâ€¯dotnet restoreâ€¯command to restore the updated dependencies. \r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see aâ€¯Dependency conflict warning, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package. \r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies \r\n\r\nRebuild your solution and then open theâ€¯project.assets.jsonâ€¯file from in each of your projectâ€™s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file. Both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing. \r\n\r\nSearch theâ€¯project.assets.jsonâ€¯file for theâ€¯vulnerable packages above using the formatâ€¯packagename/â€¯for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search: \r\n\r\nExamine the line on which they are found, the version number is after theâ€¯/. \r\n\r\nCompare to the vulnerable versions \r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that showsâ€¯\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\": \"2.1.0\" is a reference to version 2.1.0 ofâ€¯Microsoft.Data.SqlClient If yourâ€¯project.assets.jsonâ€¯file includes vulnerable versions of the nuget packages then you need to fix the transitive dependencies. \r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either \r\n\r\nNone of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or \r\n\r\nYou have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies. \r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to theâ€¯vulnerable package, you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to yourâ€¯csprojâ€¯file to override the transitive dependency. \r\n\r\n#### Editing projects to fix transitive dependencies \r\n\r\nOpenâ€¯projectname.csprojâ€¯in your editor. Look forâ€¯PackageReferenceâ€¯nodes, for example: \r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"IndirectDependency\" Version=\"1.0.0\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project> \r\n```\r\n \r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated, matching major/minor version of the vulnerableâ€¯by adding it to theâ€¯csprojâ€¯file. This is done by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version. For example,  \r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"IndirectDependency\" Version=\"1.0.0\" /> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"2.1.2\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project> \r\n\r\n ```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save yourâ€¯csprojâ€¯file. \r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updatedâ€¯csprojâ€¯file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening theâ€¯Outputâ€¯window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing theâ€¯Show output fromâ€¯drop-down list toâ€¯Package Manager. \r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute theâ€¯dotnet restoreâ€¯command to restore the new dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### Using the nuget command line to fix transitive dependencies \r\n\r\nOpen a command window and change directory to your project directory.  \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you have an indirect dependency on Microsoft.Data.SqlClient between versions 2.0.0 and 2.1.1 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient --version 2.1.2 \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you have an indirect dependency on Microsoft.Data.SqlClient below 1.1.4 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient --version 1.1.4 \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you have an indirect dependency on System.Data.SqlClient below 4.8.4 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package System.Data.SqlClient --version 4.8.5 \r\n\r\nExecute theâ€¯dotnet restoreâ€¯command to restore the new dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application \r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy. \r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 6.0, please email details toâ€¯[secure@microsoft.com](secure@microsoft.com).

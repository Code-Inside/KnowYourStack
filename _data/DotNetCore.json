The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

It looks like all tests, but one were added in the same PR that added the method. The one test added later compiles a single expression. \n\nIt is not clear what was the intent for the method. Since it resides in production code, its behavior should be tested, which increases our test matrix. For example, if we are changing some of the methods used by `CompileExpressions` to take a new input in order to behave properly in certain scenarios, we should test that `CompileExpressions` provides correct input, etc. However, if the method is meant to be a test helper and is not meant to be used in production code, then testing it would not be a smart way to spend dev resources.\n\nWe should consider moving `CompileExpressions` out of the production code and to location where other EE test helpers reside. It might be simpler and better to remove it completely. Currently only 12 tests are using it and 6 of them pass a single expression. It could be fairly simple to switch the tests to use `CompileExpression` API instead.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/80482","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"EvaluationContext.CompileExpressions method in CSharp.ExpressionCompiler has unclear purpose and should probably be removed from production code\" (#80482)"},{"Id":"3459430765","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-27T00:16:17","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"80480","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Automated] PRs inserted in VS build feature.debugger.main-11025.198","State":"closed","Body":"[View Complete Diff of Changes](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/compare/df5264d2caf5694f1d4bcdc97f7e0a0ad464dde9...ff0a209cf1a97eea64c2b32c7e1f7e11b209d789?w=1)\n- [Update localization branch to dev18.0](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/80436)\n- [Dev18: Revert \"Use immutable types in signature help (#80322)\"](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/80426)\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/80480","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Automated] PRs inserted in VS build feature.debugger.main-11025.198\" (#80480)"},{"Id":"3459430144","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-27T00:15:28","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"80479","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Automated] PRs inserted in VS build main-11026.88","State":"closed","Body":"[View Complete Diff of Changes](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/compare/ff0a209cf1a97eea64c2b32c7e1f7e11b209d789...7831533f68b1c1520c0bbad5292b28e11dfd7e58?w=1)\n- [Change NgenPriority](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/80430)\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/80479","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Automated] PRs inserted in VS build main-11026.88\" (#80479)"},{"Id":"3459107038","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-26T21:01:29","Actor":"dibarbet","Number":"80478","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update TPN with CG generated notices","State":"open","Body":"CG will generate these.

A example of an embedded language would be SQL syntax inside a C# string, which is a common practice for business applications. An analyzer might be built to error on invalid T-SQL syntax or to suggest best practices such as requiring columns to be qualified.\n\nThe source location for such diagnostics should be the relevant _subset_ of the string literal token. For example:\n\n```cs\nvar widgets = await connection.QueryAsync<Widget>(\"\"\"\n    select Widgets.Id, Parts.Id, {|XYZ0001:Name|}\n    from dbo.Widgets\n    join dbo.Parts on Parts.WidgetId = Widgets.Id\n    \"\"\");\n```\n\nWhere `{|XYZ0001:Name|}` signifies that the embedded text `Name` should be the location of a diagnostic XYZ0001.\n\nIn order to report a diagnostic, the analyzer must translate from _embedded_ string offsets within the unescaped string value (such as from `ILiteralOperation.ConstantValue`) to _source offsets_ within the C# file.\n\nThis translation currently requires the analyzer to understand and translate all escapes, as well as trimming raw string indentation _properly_. If `\\u2014` appears in the C# string, the embedded language within the string does not receive a backslash, a lowercase U, and some hex digits; instead, the embedded language gains a single em dash character in this case. This is not solved once and done; C# recently added a new escape sequence, `\\e`. C# also recently added raw string literals, and the analyzer is required to understand the intervening trimmed indentation.\n\nSuch a mapping from embedded language offsets to source file offsets is highly nuanced. It is a large burden for analyzers to solve this from scratch each time, and analyzers cannot remain language-agnostic while doing so.\n\nFurther, if the code fix wants to modify the string literal, it will not only need to know the source file offsets that match the embedded construct, it will also need to know how to escape characters. Any embedded language character that it may be inserting may need escaping in order to appear within the C# string.\n\n## Proposed API\n\nTwo things have thus far been identified as lacking:\n- A language-agnostic API to map from a given ILiteralOperation or SyntaxToken, plus a given offset into the unescaped embedded string value, to a location in the containing source file.\n- A language-agnostic API to escape character values for inclusion in literal strings.\n\nIt could be a good idea to tie together the consumption of the unescaped characters with the source file span for each character. This would improve the API usability since you would no longer have to \"just know\" that you use GetOperation + ILiteralOperation.ConstantValue to get the unescaped string, and then get a service from some other place to map its internal offsets back to the file. Also, could there be a performance advantage in analyzing a SyntaxToken directly rather than going through IOperation to get it?\n\nRoslyn has already solved cleanly with its internal [`IVirtualCharService`](https://sourceroslyn.io/#Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces/IVirtualCharService.cs). `IVirtualCharService` powers Roslyn's own embedded language support for JSON, regular expressions, and others. The interface has stood the test of time. The existence of `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.ExternalAccess.AspNetCore.EmbeddedLanguages.AspNetCoreCSharpVirtualCharService`, which is a copy of this API, also shows its usefulness.\n\nBesides these goals, it may also be worth checking with what Roslyn has learned in the implementation of its own embedded language support, which has shaped `IVirtualCharService`. There may be more concerns that are relevant to analyzers that could be uncovered by doing so.\n\nThe proposed API is similar to IVirtualCharService, but it becomes a class instead of an interface so that new APIs can be added later.\n\n```diff\n+namespace Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.EmbeddedLanguages.VirtualChars\n+{\n+    public abstract class VirtualCharService\n+    {\n+        public static VirtualCharService GetVirtualCharService(SyntaxTree tree);\n+\n+        public virtual VirtualCharSequence TryConvertToVirtualChars(SyntaxToken token, CancellationToken cancellationToken);\n+        public virtual bool TryGetEscapeCharacter(VirtualChar virtualChar, out char escapeChar);\n+    }\n+\n+    public readonly struct VirtualCharSequence\n+    {\n+        public bool IsDefault { get; }\n+        public int Length { get; }\n+        public VirtualChar this[int index] { get; }\n+\n+        // New functionality\n+        public VirtualChar GetVirtualCharAtUtf16Index(int index);\n+\n+        public override string ToString();\n+        public Enumerator GetEnumerator();\n+\n+        public struct Enumerator : IEnumerator<VirtualChar>\n+        {\n+            public bool MoveNext();\n+            public readonly VirtualChar Current { get; }\n+        }\n+    }\n+\n+    public readonly struct VirtualChar : IEquatable<VirtualChar>, IEquatable<char>, IComparable<VirtualChar>, IComparable<char>\n+    {\n+        /// <summary>\n+        /// The value of this <see cref=\"VirtualChar\"/> as a <see cref=\"Rune\"/> if such a representation is possible.\n+        /// <see cref=\"Rune\"/>s can represent Unicode codepoints that can appear in a <see cref=\"string\"/> except for\n+        /// unpaired surrogates.

When this happens across multiple lines, and the token is a raw string literal, this becomes much more complex than simply escaping the virtual characters and replacing the source text span from the start to the end. A raw string literal's trimmed indentation intervenes. Contiguous _virtual_ chars may map to noncontiguous source spans. Something will need to detect the indentation for the raw string and insert it at every inserted newline. This may be a job for a different API in the workspaces layer.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n```c#\nvar literalOperation = (ILiteralOperation)context.Operation;\n\nVirtualCharService virtualCharService = VirtualCharService.GetVirtualCharService(literalOperation.Syntax.SyntaxTree);\nVirtualCharSequence virtualCharSequence = virtualCharService.TryConvertToVirtualChars(literalOperation.Syntax, context.CancellationToken);\nif (virtualCharSequence.IsDefault)\n    return;\n\nusing var textReader = new StringReader(virtualCharSequence.ToString());\nStatementList statementList = TSqlParser.ParseStatementList(textReader, out var parseErrors);\n\nforeach (ParseError error in parseErrors)\n{\n    VirtualChar virtualChar = virtualCharSequence.GetVirtualCharAtUtf16Index(error.Offset);\n    int sourceStart = virtualChar.Span.Start;\n\n    // The TSQL parser doesn't give lengths with the errors, so make the diagnostic as long as the single T-SQL\n    // token at the error position. (TODO: Optimize the lookup)\n    TSqlParserToken? nextToken = statementList.ScriptTokenStream.FirstOrDefault(token => token.Offset > error.Offset);\n    int sourceEnd = nextToken is null\n        ? virtualCharSequence[^1].Span.End\n        : virtualCharSequence.GetVirtualCharAtUtf16Index(nextToken.Offset).Span.Start;\n\n    context.ReportDiagnostic(Diagnostic.Create(\n        DiagnosticDescriptors.InvalidTSqlSyntax,\n        Location.Create(literalOperation.Syntax.SyntaxTree, TextSpan.FromBounds(sourceStart, sourceEnd)),\n        [error.Message, error.Number]));\n}\n\n// Use visitor pattern to continue analyzing 'statementList', using TSqlParserToken offsets within\n```\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\nInstead of iterating runes, the design could iterate chars. This comes with a potential hit to usability. An analyzer that finds a surrogate pair may want to know what the pair represents. In order to know that, the analyzer can no longer walk over the characters using one iteration of the enumerator at a time.\n\nInstead of shipping a Roslyn-specific Rune class, a new Microsoft.Bcl.Rune package could be created so that .NET Standard analyzers can access System.Text.Rune. Roslyn already depends on one of the Microsoft.Bcl packages, Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces.\n\n## Risks\n\nIf Roslyn's own battle-tested `IVirtualCharService` implementation is made public, there will be no immediate risk, but having the interface and associated types public may constrain future iterations as always.\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/80477","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Analyzer API for consuming characters in embedded languages\" (#80477)"},{"Id":"3458168754","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-26T19:14:39","Actor":"winscripter","Number":"80473","RawContent":null,"Title":"Empty <param name=\"\" /> inserted for record types with trailing comma in parameter list","State":"closed","Body":"**Version Used**: 18.0.0 Insiders [11018.127] (a.k.a.

But API review gave feedback that we should also support constructed symbols.\r\nI'd like to get this backported to dev18.0 as it changes the behavior of a public API for core scenario:\r\nPreviously, when given the definition of a generic extension member, it would return the definition of the associated implementation.\r\nNow, in that scenario, it returns the associated implementation constructed with the type parameters from the extension member.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the impact, this PR shows that the SyntaxGenerator logic now has to get the `.OriginalDefinition` on the result.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [x] No\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThe fix is verified via unittests. The initial implementation of this public compiler API intentionally separated the core scenario (dealing with definitions) from the extended scenario (dealing with constructed symbols) because we only needed the former to unblock SyntaxGenerator work.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nLow. The change doesn't go deep into the compiler code, it limited to the API layer and the API itself was only added last week.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/80461","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/dev18.0] Extensions: AssociatedExtensionImplementation on constructed symbols\" (#80461)"},{"Id":"3453345972","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-25T12:13:59","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"80460","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Automated] PRs inserted in VS build main-11024.186","State":"closed","Body":"[View Complete Diff of Changes](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/compare/df5264d2caf5694f1d4bcdc97f7e0a0ad464dde9...ff0a209cf1a97eea64c2b32c7e1f7e11b209d789?w=1)\n- [Update localization branch to dev18.0](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/80436)\n- [Dev18: Revert \"Use immutable types in signature help (#80322)\"](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/80426)\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/80460","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Automated] PRs inserted in VS build main-11024.186\" (#80460)"},{"Id":"3451586762","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-25T03:33:19","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"80459","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Source code updates from dotnet/dotnet","State":"closed","Body":"\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> This is a codeflow update.

This caused IIS to return 404 errors when browsers attempted to fetch the web app manifest, breaking PWA functionality.\n\nThe issue affects all Blazor WASM PWA applications deployed to IIS servers, as the default web.config template in the SDK didn't include support for this file type that was re-included in .NET 10.\n\n## Solution\n\nAdded the missing MIME type mapping to the `BlazorWasm.web.config` template:\n\n- `<remove fileExtension=\".webmanifest\" />` - Removes any existing IIS default mapping to prevent conflicts\n- `<mimeMap fileExtension=\".webmanifest\" mimeType=\"application/manifest+json\" />` - Maps `.webmanifest` files to the correct MIME type\n\nThe MIME type `application/manifest+json` was chosen to:\n- Match the existing definition in `ContentTypeProvider.cs` \n- Follow the W3C Web App Manifest specification standard\n- Ensure consistency across the SDK\n\n## Testing\n\n- All existing Blazor WebAssembly tests continue to pass\n- Verified the web.config template includes the new mapping in the correct location\n- Confirmed the change follows the same pattern as other file extension mappings\n\nThis fix ensures that Blazor WASM PWA applications work correctly on IIS without requiring developers to manually customize their web.config files.\n\nFixes dotnet/sdk#43849\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Blazor WASM Standalone .webmanifest 404 error</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>### Is there an existing issue for this?\n> \n> - [x] I have searched the existing issues\n> \n> ### Describe the bug\n> \n> Hello.

However, upon deployment I'm getting a 404 error when deploying to IIS.\n> \n> Upon inspection, I can see that the default web.config is lacking a `<remove fileExtension=\".webmanifest\" /><mimeMap fileExtension=\".webmanifest\" mimeType=\"application/json\" />`\n> \n> Adding this manually fixes the console error. But, wouldn't this mean that new .net10 wasm pwa blazor apps will face this same issue? It doesn't seem like there's a easy fix for this for .net9 besides adding a custom web.config. However, I'm not sure what I would be missing from the \"default\" web.config template since it's autogenerated.\n> \n> ### Expected Behavior\n> \n> _No response_\n> \n> ### Steps To Reproduce\n> \n> _No response_\n> \n> ### Exceptions (if any)\n> \n> _No response_\n> \n> ### .NET Version\n> \n> _No response_\n> \n> ### Anything else?\n> \n> _No response_</issue_description>\n> \n> <agent_instructions>The fix is likely https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/src/BlazorWasmSdk/Targets/BlazorWasm.web.config\n> \n> Generate an explanation, make the changes if needed and do not add any test.</agent_instructions>\n> \n> ## Comments on the Issue (you are @copilot in this section)\n> \n> <comments>\n> </comments>\n> \n\n\n</details>\nFixes dotnet/sdk#51024\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

This helps users stay informed about available updates and can prevent issues where outdated tools cause compatibility problems with newer SDKs.\n\n## Changes\n\n### Core Functionality\n- **Enhanced ToolRestoreResult**: Added `Warning` property to carry version update notifications\n- **Version Checking Logic**: Added `CheckForNewerVersion()` method in `ToolPackageRestorer` that:\n  - Uses wildcard version ranges (`*`) to query the latest available version from package sources\n  - Compares semantic versions between manifest and latest available\n  - Applies smart logic for prerelease vs stable versions\n  - Gracefully handles network failures without breaking restore functionality\n- **Display Enhancement**: Modified `PrintConclusionAndReturn()` to display warnings in yellow text after successful restore messages\n\n### User Experience\n- **Localized Messages**: Added `RestoreNewVersionAvailable` resource string with clear, actionable messaging\n- **Non-Intrusive**: Warnings only appear during `dotnet tool restore`, never during tool execution\n- **Resilient**: Network issues or package source problems don't cause restore failures\n\n## Example Output\n\nBefore:\n```\nTool 'dotnet-ef' (version '6.0.0') was restored. Available commands: dotnet-ef\n\nRestore was successful.\n```\n\nAfter:\n```\nTool 'dotnet-ef' (version '6.0.0') was restored. Available commands: dotnet-ef\n\nA newer version of tool 'dotnet-ef' is available (version '9.0.9'). Consider updating your manifest file.\n\nRestore was successful.\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n- Added comprehensive unit test coverage for the warning functionality\n- Verified with real-world packages (dotnet-ef, powershell) showing proper version detection\n- Confirmed warnings only appear during restore operations, not tool execution\n- Validated all existing tests pass with no regressions\n- Tested edge cases including latest versions, multiple tools, and network failures\n\n## Behavior Notes\n\n- **Scope**: Only applies to local tools defined in `.config/dotnet-tools.json` files\n- **Version Logic**: Shows warnings for newer stable versions, or any newer version if current is prerelease\n- **Performance**: Adds minimal overhead during restore by reusing existing package query infrastructure\n- **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing functionality\n\nThis addresses the scenario described in the issue where CI systems fail due to outdated tools, but users aren't aware that newer compatible versions are available.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>`dotnet tool restore` should provide warnings if new versions of tool is available</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>### Is your feature request related to a problem?

I need a team member review for the actual merge.\r\n\r\n## Changes Made\r\n\r\n- **Single Format String Approach**: Refactored to use a single format string in `PackageIdentityArgumentDescription` with placeholders `{0}` and `{1}` for package name and version, eliminating duplicate resource strings\r\n- **Parameterized CommonArguments**: Implemented parameterized methods for package identity arguments that accept example package and version parameters:\r\n  - `RequiredPackageIdentityArgument(string examplePackage, string exampleVersion)` - parameterized version\r\n  - `OptionalPackageIdentityArgument(string examplePackage, string exampleVersion)` - parameterized version\r\n  - Backward-compatible overloads maintained for existing callers\r\n- **Context-Specific Examples**: Updated tool command parsers to use appropriate examples:\r\n  - Tool commands (install/update/execute/dnx): use `\"dotnetsay\", \"2.1.7\"` parameters\r\n  - Non-tool commands: use `\"Newtonsoft.Json\", \"13.0.3\"` parameters (default)\r\n- **Runtime Formatting**: Uses `string.Format()` to populate placeholders dynamically at runtime\r\n- **Updated CLI Snapshot Baselines**: Updated completion test baselines to reflect the new tool examples\r\n- **Documentation**: Updated copilot-instructions with the dogfood testing approach for verifying CLI command changes\r\n\r\n## Commands Affected\r\n\r\nAll tool-related commands now show appropriate .NET tool examples:\r\n- `dnx --help`\r\n- `dotnet tool install --help` \r\n- `dotnet tool exec --help`\r\n- `dotnet tool execute --help`\r\n- `dotnet tool update --help`\r\n\r\nNon-tool commands continue to use the generic package examples (e.g., `dotnet package add --help` still shows `Newtonsoft.Json@13.0.3`).\r\n\r\nThe changes maintain backward compatibility while providing more helpful and accurate examples for users working with .NET tools. The implementation uses a single source of truth for the format string, making it more maintainable and eliminating duplicate content.\r\n\r\nFixes dotnet/sdk#51008\r\n\r\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\r\n\r\n> \r\n> ----\r\n> \r\n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\r\n> \r\n> <issue_title>`dnx --help` suggests use of a package that is not a .NET SDK Tool</issue_title>\r\n> <issue_description>### Describe the bug\r\n> \r\n> `dnx --help` provides the following help output:\r\n> \r\n> ```shell\r\n> dnx --help\r\n> Description:\r\n>   Executes a tool from source without permanently installing it.\r\n> \r\n> Usage:\r\n>   dotnet dnx <packageId> [<commandArguments>...] [options]\r\n> \r\n> Arguments:\r\n>   <packageId>         Package reference in the form of a package identifier like 'Newtonsoft.Json' or package identifier and version separated by '@' like\r\n>                       'Newtonsoft.Json@13.0.3'.\r\n>   <commandArguments>  Arguments forwarded to the tool\r\n> \r\n> Options:\r\n>   --version <VERSION>       The version of the tool package to install.\r\n>   -y, --yes                 Accept all confirmation prompts using \"yes.\" [default: False]\r\n>   --interactive             Allows the command to stop and wait for user input or action (for example to complete authentication).

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0  Runtime or .NET 9.0.100 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.1 you should download and install Runtime 2.1.18 or SDK 2.1.515 (for Visual Studio 2017 v15.9), 2.1.612 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.0) or 2.1.807 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.2 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.1 you should download and install Runtime 3.1.4 or SDK 3.1.105 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.4) or 3.1.301 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.5 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1\r\n* For machines running .NET 5 Preview you should download and install .NET 5 Preview 4 when available from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple affected versions you must update the runtime or SDKs for each version.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the .NET Core Bug Bounty.

This is particularly profound in Office extensions since most inherit from `IDispatch`. The fact that this hasn't been reported seems to imply few customers are authoring Office extensions using .NET Core at present.

It is possible .NET Core COM server authors have come to rely on this unusual behavior so it is possible we break someone. How that manifests would near impossible to determine given the fact that this is a bug in our following COM rules.\r\n\r\nThe change itself is isolated to COM scenarios only and has no impact on any scenario other than COM servers authored in .NET Core. This seems to be an acceptable risk given that the primary motivation for COM support was for Office and since few (read one) reports of the failure and it does impact the Office scenario the fix to follow the COM rules appears warranted.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28073","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[.NET Core 3.1] Don't rely on the built-in interface marshaller during COM activation.\" (#28073)"},{"Id":"670175635","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-11T23:15:55","Actor":"sdmaclea","Number":"28072","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix DataTargetReader::AlignBase()","State":"closed","Body":"## Summary\r\n\r\n#28033 added `DAC_ALIGNAS` macro to force MSVC and clang/gcc compilers layouts to match.

Sends on a WebSocket can't run concurrently, and there's a lock that protects access to shared resources, including a pooled buffer.  The code that ends a send operation returns the buffer to the pool and releases the lock, but it does so in the opposite (wrong) order.  As such, a second concurrent send could end up trying to use the buffer concurrently with the first send operation releasing it.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nInitially reported as a sporadic ArgumentException that escapes from within the WebSocket implementation (from valid usage).  But in theory it could result in data corruption throughout the process, with a buffer being returned to the pool while it's still in use.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nLow.

This encourages programmers to add a pattern that handles every case (often times this case simply throws an exception i.e. `_ => throw new ..`).\r\n\r\nBut that means that when you add a new named value to your enum you won't get a warning since it has already been handled (incorrectly) by the catch-all pattern.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion:\r\n\r\nIf instead you get a different warning depending on whether or not the unhandled enum value is named or unnamed, people could decide for themselves how they would like to approach this issue by enabling/disabling the appropriate warning.\r\n\r\n**Languages applicable:**\r\n\r\nC#, I'm not sure if VB has switch expressions.\r\n\r\n**Code example that the analyzer should report:**\r\n\r\nWith this enum:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\npublic enum Operation\r\n{\r\n    Plus,\r\n    Minus,\r\n    Multiply,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis code:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\npublic static string OperationToString(Operation op)\r\n{\r\n    return op switch\r\n    {\r\n        Operation.Plus => \"+\",\r\n        Operation.Minus => \"-\",\r\n        // Note!: Operation.Multiply has not been handled by accident\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand this code:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\npublic static string OperationToString(Operation op)\r\n{\r\n    return op switch\r\n    {\r\n        Operation.Plus => \"+\",\r\n        Operation.Minus => \"-\",\r\n        Operation.Multiply => \"*\",\r\n        // Note!: Every named enum value has been handled\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould be reported with different warnings.\r\n\r\n**Additional information:**\r\n\r\nI expect neither warning to trigger when you add a catch-all pattern. This means that when you intend for your switch expression to handle every named value you would generally not add a catch-all pattern so that you get an alert on those switch expressions when you add a new named enum value.\r\n\r\nI think the [Flags] attribute should cause *unnamed* enum values that can be created by using `bitwise or` on *named* enum values should also be considered named for the purposes of these warning.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/47066","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Split CS8509 into unhandled named and unnamed enum values\" (#47066)"},{"Id":"683983001","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-22T11:50:20","Actor":"Youssef1313","Number":"47065","RawContent":null,"Title":"Don't report CS0534 when a record inherit from a class","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #47064\r\n\r\nThis PR targets master, I'm not sure if I should target features/records instead.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/47065","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Don't report CS0534 when a record inherit from a class\" (#47065)"},{"Id":"683977312","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-22T11:02:16","Actor":"PathogenDavid","Number":"47064","RawContent":null,"Title":"Class inheriting from abstract record complains about unimplemented <Clone>$","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: 3.8.0-3.20421.1 ([9f0b1046](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/commit/9f0b1046))\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\nEncountered while refactoring code to take advantage of records: ([SharpLab](https://sharplab.io/#v2:EYLgtghgzgLgpgJwDQxAN0QSwGYE8A+EwsCEAxjAAQJxkD2CAJpQILEykUBKtDzA3gF8AsACgxAAQBMlAMp0wcAMIAbaFEohW7TjB70mlIWKA===))\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nabstract record AbstractRecord {}\r\n\r\nclass SomeClass : AbstractRecord {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\n\r\nA lone CS8865 error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror CS8865: Only records may inherit from records.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\n\r\nYou get an additional red herring error about not implementing `<Clone>$`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror CS8865: Only records may inherit from records.\r\nerror CS0534: 'SomeClass' does not implement inherited abstract member 'AbstractRecord.<Clone>$()'\r\n```\r\n\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nNot the worst thing ever, but it does leak the unspeakable synthesized method, which could be confusing to developers who aren't aware of the internal mechanics of records.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, due to how squiggles for these errors are shown Visual Studio, the red herring can be the first one the developer sees:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/278957/90954730-ad024800-e43c-11ea-8c0c-e172e4a3147d.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/47064","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Class inheriting from abstract record complains about unimplemented <Clone>$\" (#47064)"},{"Id":"683951442","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-22T10:12:48","Actor":"Youssef1313","Number":"47060","RawContent":null,"Title":"Issue with running a test locally in Visual Studio","State":"closed","Body":"I wrote the following test in `Binder_Statements_Tests`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        <ConditionalFact(GetType(WindowsDesktopOnly), Reason:=\"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/45158\")>\r\n        Public Sub EndWithSingleLineIf()\r\n            Dim source =\r\n<compilation>\r\n    <file name=\"a.vb\">\r\n        <![CDATA[\r\nImports System\r\n\r\nModule Module1\r\n    Public Sub Main()\r\n        If True Then End Else Console.WriteLine(\"Test\")\r\n    End Sub\r\nEnd Module\r\n    ]]>\r\n    </file>\r\n</compilation>\r\n\r\n            Dim compilation = CreateCompilationWithMscorlib40AndVBRuntime(source, TestOptions.ReleaseExe)\r\n            AssertTheseDiagnostics(compilation)\r\n        End Sub\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I attempt to run or debug it, it gets skipped:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTest only supported on Windows desktop\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm already running on a Windows (Azure VM, if that matters).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/47060","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Issue with running a test locally in Visual Studio\" (#47060)"},{"Id":"683953865","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-22T08:06:07","Actor":"Youssef1313","Number":"47062","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix bug when \"End statement\" is used in single-line if","State":"open","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/45158\r\n\r\nThe \"OrElse\" part was existing in `IsValidStatementTerminator` in `ParserScan.vb`.\r\n\r\nIt was removed in #14822 to fix #14761.

I'm hoping this could be solved with some trick/workaround on the UWP side, as I'd really, really like not to be forced to alter the API surface on the .NET Standard side for a specific issue with the .NET Native compiler.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance! 😊","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/8273","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[.NET Native] ILT0005 build error with ref T returning delegate\" (#8273)"},{"Id":"682498755","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-20T07:43:54","Actor":"RalfKornmannEnvision","Number":"8272","RawContent":null,"Title":"Arm64","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/8272","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Arm64\" (#8272)"},{"Id":"682460020","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-20T06:36:00","Actor":"RalfKornmannEnvision","Number":"8271","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support for ARM64 on UNIX like systems compiler and runtime","State":"open","Body":"Implements most of the missing parts for ARM64 on UNIX like hosts.\r\n* Change section for native signature layout from read only to data for non Windows systems to avoid linker issues with absolute relocations between sections\r\n* Store CFI data for ARM64 non Windows builds\r\n* Add special ARM64 relocation types were needed\r\n* Implements functions to handle 28 bit offsets in ARM64 opcodes\r\n* Implements ARM64 instruction encoding\r\n* Implements helper nodes ARM64 code generators\r\n* Implements ARM64 intrinsic supports by following the XArch pattern\r\n* Implements runtime query and check of required intrinsics\r\n* Use special name for AssignRef helper functions as RyuJit uses a custom calling convention for these on ARM64 \r\n* Change relocation type for exception type in catch handler to avoid an assert in LLVM.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.  Ratios greater than 1 mean the benchmark performed worse with the JCC microcode update applied.\r\n - Y: Count of benchmarks in the bucket.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210322/80840714-ba0bda80-8bb2-11ea-8869-07ec55182661.png)\r\n**While there are some outliers, for the most part, the benchmarks are clustered around a ratio of 1 with the most benchmarks in the 1.038 – 1.085 bucket, which represents single digit percentage degradation.**","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\" (#153)"},{"Id":"583170428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-17T17:16:09","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"152","RawContent":null,"Title":"March 2020 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on March 2020.

Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

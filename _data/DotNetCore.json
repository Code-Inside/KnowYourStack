The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

In a Blazor app, add a non-async, void-returning EventCallback handler in your C# code and reference it via the relevant EventCallback Parameter in the .razor code (e.g. add an OnClick handler to a button)\r\n2. Modify the body of the method added in step 1 by typing out a call to `await Task.Delay(1000);`.\r\n3. Notice that the signature of the method has been changed from `void` to `async void` and there are no errors or warnings in the IDE or build output at either the callsite in razor or the method signature in C#.\r\n\r\n(note that this is just one example where the trap you fall into is easy to hit, but there are likely others)\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\n\r\nSince the generally accepted guidance is to avoid `async void` methods whenever possible (with some limited exceptions for event handlers, etc), I would expect that doing the above steps would either:\r\n\r\n1. NOT add the async, so that I am prompted with squiggles/warnings/errors to correct my signature and I can take note of changing the entire signature correctly, OR\r\n2. Change `void` to `Task` in addition to adding `async` so that I am in the more-likely-correct state for that method and if it conflicts with the callsite I will get squiggles/warnings/errors that lead me to address it there as well.\r\n\r\n**Actual Behavior**:\r\n\r\n`async` is added, but there are no squiggles/warnings/errors telling me that I _likely_ need to change something else as well. \r\n\r\nI just fell into this trap in https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/819 (See https://github.com/dotnet/aspire/pull/819#discussion_r1395303542) where I converted an existing void method to `async` and let VS handle that and didn't notice that I should do more. Frankly saying I let VS handle it is probably too strong - VS handled it without me even really noticing, and I _really_ didn't notice because there weren't the expected squiggles/warnings/errors after adding await calls to a non-async method.\r\n\r\nOf course, ultimately its on me (and my reviewers) to notice these things and I will now be more careful in the future. And I know there were previous discussions about this when the feature was implemented. But it feels like from a tooling perspective we could do better to not guide users right into the trap so I figured it was worth bringing up again.\r\n"},{"Id":"33585949127","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-11-23T23:20:31","Actor":"sharwell","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/63081","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Auto add async to method signature feature improvement\" (#63081) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Auto-add-async-to-method-signature-featu/10088036)._\n\n---\nIDE:Visual Studio 2022 17.3.0 Preview 2.0\n\nCase 1:\nCurrent:\n`\npublic void RunAsync() {\n    RunSomethingAsync() // -->add .await\n}\n`\nResult:\n`\npublic async void RunAsync() {\n    await RunSomethingAsync();\n}\n`\nExpect:\n`\npublic async Task RunAsync() /* -->change return type 'void' to 'Task'  */ { \n    await RunSomethingAsync();\n}\n`\n\nCase 2:\nCurrent:\n`\npublic string GetAsync() {\n    return GetStringAsync() // -->add .await\n}\n`\nResult:\n`\npublic async string GetAsync() {\n    return await GetStringAsync();\n}\n`\nExpect:\n`\npublic async Task GetAsync() /* -->change return type 'string' to 'Task'  */ {\n    return await GetStringAsync();\n}\n`\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 7/5/2022, 11:00 PM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)"},{"Id":"33585911899","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-11-23T23:16:19","Actor":"sharwell","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/70954","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Set stack trace on logged assertion failure exceptions\" (#70954) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"Prior to this, assertion failures in integration tests were causing test failures (good), but not providing any context about where the assertion failure occurred (bad).

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n#### **Fine tuning the patch**\r\nThe patch introduces two new AppContext properties: \r\n\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxEnhanceYourCalmCount `\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize `\r\n\r\nThe properties can be set in a [variety](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime-config/) of ways, including AppContext.SetData or AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetData in code (the former is not available in 6.0), RuntimeHostConfigurationOption in a project file, or environment variables. \r\n\r\nMaxEnhanceYourCalmCount is a cap on how many ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM (EYC) messages (generally triggered by excessive client stream resets) the server can send per second on a particular connection without dropping it.  The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\r\n* If you are using one of the affected packages, please update to the patched version listed above.\r\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n\r\n Version:   6.0.300\r\n Commit:    8473146e7d\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n\r\n  Version: 6.0.5\r\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n\r\n  6.0.300 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0 RC2 Runtime  or .NET 8.0 RC2 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.8) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 7.0, you should download and install Runtime 7.0.13 or SDK 7.0.113 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 6.0, you should download and install Runtime 6.0.24 or SDK 6.0.319 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.2) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0.\r\n\r\n.NET 6.0 and and .NET 7.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update. To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n#### **Fine tuning the patch**\r\nThe patch introduces two new AppContext properties: \r\n\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxEnhanceYourCalmCount `\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize `\r\n\r\nThe properties can be set in a [variety](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime-config/) of ways, including AppContext.SetData or AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetData in code (the former is not available in 6.0), RuntimeHostConfigurationOption in a project file, or environment variables. \r\n\r\nMaxEnhanceYourCalmCount is a cap on how many ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM (EYC) messages (generally triggered by excessive client stream resets) the server can send per second on a particular connection without dropping it.  The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

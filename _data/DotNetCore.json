See that issue for discussion.\n\nWe'll be reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3 and encourage both ASP.NET Core 2.1 and ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to update to it. In this post I'll provide more background.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> This post only applies if you're using ASP.NET Core **on .NET Framework**. If you're using ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Core 2.x, it is [already out of support][netcore-support], and you should upgrade to a supported version such as .NET 8.\n\n### Background\n\nEarly versions of ASP.NET Core were provided for .NET Framework and .NET Core. Since 2021, [ASP.NET Core 2.1 is supported][aspnet21-support] only when running on .NET Framework. ASP.NET Core 2.2 has been out of support on all platforms since 2019.\n\nThis happened before we had a [predictable schedule and alternate releases of Standard Term Support (STS) and Long Term Support (LTS)][core-release-policies]. Many users upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2, not realizing that this reduced their support duration.\n\nAs a result, we now have users that are running on the unsupported version of ASP.NET Core 2.2 on .NET Framework.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support        |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | [Supported][aspnet21-support] |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019       |\n\n### How to stay supported\n\n* If you're on .NET Core, you should upgrade to .NET 8 and use ASP.NET Core 8\n* If you're on .NET Framework, you can either migrate to .NET 8 or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.3, which is the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1 (see below)\n\nSince ASP.NET Core 2.x for .NET Framework is just a set of packages, downgrading isn't that easy; there are well over one hundred packages and not all of them have 2.x version numbers. To make matters worse, there are NuGet packages out there that also upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2. Downgrading to ASP.NET Core 2.1 would mean that NuGet fails to restore these dependencies with errors.\n\nIn order to make this easier, we'll reship ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, thus facilitating this downgrade as a package upgrade.\n\nYou might wonder why we don't reship ASP.NET Core 2.2 as 2.3 instead. The answer is breaking changes. ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago, while ASP.NET Core 2.1 kept being supported. We feel it would be wrong to force ASP.NET Core 2.1 users to accommodate those breaking changes in order to stay supported.\n\nUsers on ASP.NET Core 2.2 are unsupported and won't receive any security updates. Our priority is to help those users to get onto a supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework.\n\nBy reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, we provide users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 an off ramp to the supported version via a regular NuGet upgrade. Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 will also be pulled forward to 2.3, but since it's the same code as 2.1, there are no breaking changes. Moving forward, all updates to ASP.NET Core 2.1 will be published as 2.3. However, if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.1, you don't need to move to 2.3 in order to get updates. If we find security issues with 2.1 packages, those will be marked as vulnerable and the recommended version will be versioned as 2.3. Except for the version number changes, that's how ASP.NET Core 2.1 works today, so there are no changes for you and you don't need to preemptively update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 to receive those warnings.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n>\n> Please note that if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.2, you will *not* be getting vulnerability warnings because the product is out of support. There is no change here, this has been the case since ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago. Therefore, if you're on ASP.NET Core 2.2, we strongly recommend to update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 as soon as possible in order to receive security fixes again.\n\nWe understand that this can be confusing, but we believe it's the best compromise to help ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to get back onto a supported train.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support                          |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | Supported with ASP.NET Core 2.3                 |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019                         |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.3 | [Supported, same code as 2.1][aspnet21-support] |\n\n### Summary\n\nFor .NET Core, ASP.NET Core 2.x is and remains unsupported.\n\nThe following statements are specific for ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Framework:\n\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.1 is and remains supported**.\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.2 is and remains unsupported**.\n* **We're re-versioning ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3** to allow ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to move to a supported version.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 should update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. Since it's the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1, there are no breaking changes or feature additions. This operation won't require any code changes on your side. But it will make your life easier as all future updates will be versioned as 2.3.x, so you'll have a consistent set of versions.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. This will ensure you get off of the unsupported version and thus will get security fixes. You should expect breaking changes as you're effectively downgrading to the code from ASP.NET Core 2.1. If you can't live without the features being added in ASP.NET Core 2.2, you'll have to migrate to a supported .NET version with those features, such as .NET 8.\n* **This does not extend or reduce the support durations of any products, nor which versions of .NET are supported where**. It's purely a re-versioning of ASP.NET Core 2.1 in order to help the math in the package manager. The net effect of this change is that the last supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework is also the highest minor version (2.3).\n\n[aspnet21-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/aspnet/2.1-packages\n[netcore-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core\n[core-release-policies]: https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-policies.md\n\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/58598.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

The `AdhocWorkspace` and `MSBuildWorkspace` classes are `sealed` and while one can derive from `Workspace` itself, trying to implement a basic `Workspace` by copying the code for `AdhocWorkspace` won't work because said class [uses `internal` APIs](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/bf617ef799cf741877bb181a16e25bd841f04e25/src/Workspaces/Core/Portable/Workspace/AdhocWorkspace.cs#L154).\n\nGiven that there are a number of `Workspace` implementations in the Roslyn codebase itself, I'm sure that you can appreciate that being able to implement/extend `Workspace` is valuable. Looking though old issues, it looks like `Workspace` was originally [intended to be extensible](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/19891#issuecomment-305252678).\n\n## Proposed API\n\nEither remove `sealed` from `AdhocWorkspace` (and maybe `MSBuildWorkspace`?) or provide a new abstract `AbstractCustomWorkspace` class which implements the parts which require internal APIs.\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\nIt's entirely possible that I'm missing something here and that this is already possible. An alternative solution would be to document/provide a sample of how to implement a custom workspace on top of `Workspace` with existing APIs.\n\n## Risks\n\nMore API surface for the Roslyn team to maintain ;)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/76433","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"API Proposal: Allow creating custom Workspace classes\" (#76433)"},{"Id":"2739812336","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-14T12:16:29","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"76432","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Automated] PRs inserted in VS build feature.debugger.shadowDebug-35613.136","State":"closed","Body":"[View Complete Diff of Changes](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/compare/94fff7ad4f11977f903f435b0d97dcf0f2183710...86d60f7a00b0274a806a40afde8801a89d27e6bc?w=1)\n- [Reduce allocations in WithUsingNamespacesAndTypesBinder.GetForwardedToAssemblyInUsingNamespaces (76370)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76370)\n- [Share more code in extract method (76382)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76382)\n- [Switch code in extract method to using immutable arrays (76378)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76378)\n- [Do not bail generating base type initializer in the presence of use site warnings (76347)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76347)\n- [Remove an enumerator allocation in SymbolCompletionItem.CreateWorker (76375)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76375)\n- [Language feature status: add dictionary expressions (76377)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76377)\n- [Reduce allocations in ProjectState's ctor (76369)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76369)\n- [Reduce allocations in CompletionItem.GetEntireDisplayText (76373)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76373)\n- [Reduce allocations in AbstractSymbolCompletionProvider.UnionSymbols (76368)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76368)\n- [Reduce allocations in AbstractRecommendationServiceBasedCompletionProvider.GetSymbolsAsync (76365)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76365)\n- [Handle other object initializer kinds in ref safety analysis (76339)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76339)\n- [Ensure that 'extract method' follows the user's 'use this/me' preference (76366)](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76366)\n- [Initialize fields when possible when adding parameters to constructors.

When you run `dotnet nuget why Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers`, and get 47,088 lines of output, there's a need for a simplified view.\n\nSkimming this 47k lines in a few places tells me that the package in question is coming from a morass of third-party packages. Now that I know that, I'm left with two questions:\n\n- How many of the third-party packages are _directly_ referencing `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers`, so that I can report them all to the vendor? Skimming 47k lines of output to answer this question is not realistic.\n\n- Are there any other packages besides these third-party packages that also may be causing `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers` to be referenced? Again, I saw pages flashing by, but I can't be sure that I'm not missing something, and I can't skim 47k lines. I could try to recreate an empty solution structure with only package references and no source files, and try removing this vendor's packages from every project in the solution and running `dotnet nuget why` again, but that's not nice and quick either.\n\nTo address this situation, please consider providing an option that can be used to limit the output so that it displays only the _immediate_ parent packages that bring in the queried package, once per project and target. The output will not explain why the parent packages were included, and this is by design.\n\nAs a starting point for design, I would suggest an ancestor depth parameter, so perhaps `--depth 1` would provide what I'm requesting here, but `--depth 2` might explain all the _unique_ ancestry paths up to two steps removed from the queried package. `--depth 2` would still include any one-step-deep paths directly back to the project, with a single intervening parent, as well as any direct references back to the project with no intervening parent.\n\n### Motivating image\n\nThis is 1/850th of the output.

This is so that the final DLL file goes into that folder _without_ the intermediate `Release` and `net9.0` folder.\n- I compiled the console app successfully, the output folder contained the final DLL in the folder `C:\\Users\\calope\\source\\repos\\tmp\\diff\\after_simple\\`.\n- Then I try to consume that DLL using GenAPI (via a custom console app that has GenAPI as dependency).

We can't investigate custom projects, so don't point us to such, please.\n- if we will not be able to repro the behavior you're reporting\n-->\nUp until yesterday I was installing net8.0 on AWS Linux 2023 using the following bash script:\n```\n    sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc\n    sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/microsoft-prod.repo https://packages.microsoft.com/config/fedora/37/prod.repo\n    sudo dnf install -y dotnet-sdk-8.0\n    dotnet --list-sdks\n```\nnet9.0 wouldn't install until I updated it to /fedora/38:\n```\n    sudo rpm --import https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc\n    sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/microsoft-prod.repo https://packages.microsoft.com/config/fedora/38/prod.repo\n    sudo dnf install -y dotnet-sdk-8.0\n    dotnet --list-sdks\n    sudo dnf install -y dotnet-sdk-9.0\n    dotnet --list-sdks\n```\nHowever, running this process results in the second dotnet --list-sdks returning:\n```\n9.0.101 [/usr/share/dotnet/sdk]\n```\nand --list-runtimes shows:\n```\nMicrosoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\nMicrosoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n```\nnet8.0 is no longer available, and some operations that use net8.0 show errors indicating that it is not available.\n \nSimply manually creating a symbolic link to net8.0 (whose files were still there) made the SDK show in --list-sdks, but not in --list-runtimes (another symbolic link may solve that as well?).\n\nAWS Support came up with a process that seems to work, but it involves raw downloading, untarring, and environment variable setting, but a package-based installation is much-preferred.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n<!-- \nInclude the exception you get when facing this issue\n-->\n\n### Further technical details\n- Include the output of `dotnet --info`\n- The IDE (VS / VS Code/ VS4Mac) you're running on, and its version","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/45440","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Installing net9.0 SDK on AWS Linux 2023 breaks net8.0 SDK and runtime\" (#45440)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Announcements-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2653140062","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T19:35:17","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"335","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET November 2024 Updates","State":"open","Body":"# .NET November 2024 Updates\n\nToday, we are releasing .NET 9 , .NET 8.0.11, and .NET 6.0.36 updates.\n\n* https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9599 \n* [.NET 9.0 Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0)\n* [.NET 8.0.11 and .NET SDK 8.0.404](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/8.0/8.0.11/8.0.11.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0))\n* [.NET 6.0.36 and .NET SDK 6.0.427](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.36/6.0.36.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0))\n\nAlso announced at [.NET Updates in November 2024](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-and-dotnet-framework-november-2024-servicing-updates/).\n\nThis issue will be updated if there are any additional releases during the month.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/335","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET November 2024 Updates\" (#335)"},{"Id":"2653127024","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T19:27:36","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"334","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-43498 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-43498 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\n\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 9.0.

See that issue for discussion.\n\nWe'll be reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3 and encourage ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to update to it. In this post I'll provide more background.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> This post only applies if you're using ASP.NET Core **on .NET Framework**. If you're using ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Core 2.x, it is [already out of support][netcore-support], and you should upgrade to a supported version such as .NET 8.\n\n### Background\n\nEarly versions of ASP.NET Core were provided for .NET Framework and .NET Core. Since 2021, [ASP.NET Core 2.1 is supported][aspnet21-support] only when running on .NET Framework. ASP.NET Core 2.2 has been out of support on all platforms since 2019.\n\nThis happened before we had a [predictable schedule and alternate releases of Standard Term Support (STS) and Long Term Support (LTS)][core-release-policies]. Many users upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2, not realizing that this reduced their support duration.\n\nAs a result, we now have users that are running on the unsupported version of ASP.NET Core 2.2 on .NET Framework.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support        |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | [Supported][aspnet21-support] |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019       |\n\n### How to stay supported\n\n* If you're on .NET Core, you should upgrade to .NET 8 and use ASP.NET Core 8\n* If you're on .NET Framework, you can either migrate to .NET 8 or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.3, which is the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1 (see below)\n\nSince ASP.NET Core 2.x for .NET Framework is just a set of packages, downgrading isn't that easy; there are well over one hundred packages and not all of them have 2.x version numbers. To make matters worse, there are NuGet packages out there that also upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2. Downgrading to ASP.NET Core 2.1 would mean that NuGet fails to restore these dependencies with errors.\n\nIn order to make this easier, we'll reship ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, thus facilitating this downgrade as a package upgrade.\n\nYou might wonder why we don't reship ASP.NET Core 2.2 as 2.3 instead. The answer is breaking changes. ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago, while ASP.NET Core 2.1 kept being supported. We feel it would be wrong to force ASP.NET Core 2.1 users to accommodate those breaking changes in order to stay supported.\n\nUsers on ASP.NET Core 2.2 are unsupported and won't receive any security updates. Our priority is to help those users to get onto a supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework.\n\nBy reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, we provide users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 an off ramp to the supported version via a regular NuGet upgrade. Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 will also be pulled forward to 2.3, but since it's the same code as 2.1, there are no breaking changes. Moving forward, all updates to ASP.NET Core 2.1 will be published as 2.3. However, if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.1, you don't need to move to 2.3 in order to get updates. If we find security issues with 2.1 packages, those will be marked as vulnerable and the recommended version will be versioned as 2.3. Except for the version number changes, that's how ASP.NET Core 2.1 works today, so there are no changes for you and you don't need to preemptively update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 to receive those warnings.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n>\n> Please note that if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.2, you will *not* be getting vulnerability warnings via NuGet because the product is out of support. There is no change here, this has been the case since ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago. Therefore, if you're on ASP.NET Core 2.2, we strongly recommend to update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 as soon as possible in order to receive security fixes again.\n\nWe understand that this can be confusing, but we believe it's the best compromise to help ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to get back onto a supported train.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support                          |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | Supported with ASP.NET Core 2.3                 |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019                         |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.3 | [Supported, same code as 2.1][aspnet21-support] |\n\n### Summary\n\nFor .NET Core, ASP.NET Core 2.x is and remains unsupported.\n\nThe following statements are specific for ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Framework:\n\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.1 is and remains supported**.\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.2 is and remains unsupported**.\n* **We're re-versioning ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3** to allow ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to move to a supported version.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 should update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. Since it's the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1, there are no breaking changes or feature additions. This operation won't require any code changes on your side. But it will make your life easier as all future updates will be versioned as 2.3.x, so you'll have a consistent set of versions.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. This will ensure you get off of the unsupported version and thus will get security fixes. You should expect breaking changes as you're effectively downgrading to the code from ASP.NET Core 2.1. If you can't live without the features being added in ASP.NET Core 2.2, you'll have to migrate to a supported .NET version with those features, such as .NET 8.\n* **This does not extend or reduce the support durations of any products, nor which versions of .NET are supported where**. It's purely a re-versioning of ASP.NET Core 2.1 in order to help the math in the package manager. The net effect of this change is that the last supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework is also the highest minor version (2.3).\n\n[aspnet21-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/aspnet/2.1-packages\n[netcore-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core\n[core-release-policies]: https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-policies.md\n\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/58598.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nThe `CopyWithPrivateKey` methods that combine a certificate with its associated private key fail on macOS 15 when using in-memory (ephemeral) keys.  This failure is most commonly seen when creating new certificates via `CertificateRequest.CreateSelfSigned` or when loading a certificate and key from a PEM file (or files) with `X509Certificate2.CreateFromPem`, which utilize the affected methods.\r\n\r\nCallers of these methods on macOS 15 (\"Sequoia\") will receive a `CryptographicException`, specifically `Interop+AppleCrypto+AppleCommonCryptoCryptographicException: The specified item is no longer valid. It may have been deleted from the keychain.`  The `dotnet dev-certs https` command relies on `CertificateRequest.CreateSelfSigned` and fails with this error.\r\n\r\nThis issue affects .NET 6, .NET 8, and .NET 9. The issue is addressed in the upcoming .NET 6.0.34, .NET 8.0.10, and 9.0.0-rc2 releases, scheduled for release in October 2024.\r\n\r\n## Root Cause\r\n\r\nmacOS 15 uses a different status code to indicate a key is not in a Keychain than prior versions do.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\nIf you have not already upgraded to macOS 15 from a prior version and use .NET, you are not impacted by this issue.  If you are planning to upgrade to macOS 15, the workaround is to upgrade to .NET 6.0.34. .NET 8.0.10, or .NET 9.0.0-rc2 (scheduled for October 2024) prior to upgrading to macOS 15.\r\n\r\nLoading a certificate and its associated private key from a PKCS#12/PFX are not affected.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nWe [announced Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-the-new-microsoftdatasqlclient/) in the first half of 2019 and [shipped the first stable](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-blog/released-general-availability-of-microsoft-data-sqlclient-1-0/ba-p/825859) package later that year. That release [coincided with .NET Core 3.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-0/#introducing-the-new-sqlclient). We’ve been developing [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient) in the [dotnet/SqlClient](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient) repo since that time, over the last five years. It’s now time to start the deprecation process for the [System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient) package. We plan to take a staged process to deprecation, with the intent to align support changes and associated code transition activities between these libraries to natural migration points between .NET major versions.\r\n\r\nAll System.Data.SqlClient users are encouraged to transition to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. We offer improvements and significantly higher support via the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nWe intend to deprecate the System.Data.SqlClient package in stages.\r\n- **Before .NET 9 GA:**\r\n  - Publish a new 5.0.0 package, including the following changes.\r\n  - Remove support for .NET 7 and earlier and .NET Framework 4.6.1 and earlier.\r\n  - Publish assets for the following target frameworks: .NET 8, .NET Framework 4.6.2, .NET Standard 2.0.\r\n  - Add [Obsolete attributes](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/attributes/general#obsolete-attribute) to .NET 8 and .NET Standard 2.0 assets. This will generate new warnings for .NET 8+ and .NET Standard users.\r\n  - Continue to offer security servicing, for .NET 8, and .NET Framework 4.6.2+ application users.\r\n- **After .NET 9 GA:**\r\n  - No change\r\n  - We will not support this package for .NET 9+ application users.\r\n- **After .NET 8 EOL:**\r\n  - Remove support for .NET 8 users (the .NET 8 library will be removed).\r\n  - Maintain support for .NET Framework 4.6.2+ users.\r\n  - Security servicing will be provided via .NET Framework, not the package, at that point.\r\n  - We do not expect to update the package again after this point.\r\n  - We will not mark the package as deprecated since it will only support .NET Framework users with an implementation provided by .NET Framework.\r\n\r\nWe will remove support in the package for unsupported .NET and .NET Framework versions at various stages of this deprecation plan. Users affected by those changes are encouraged to move to a supported .NET or .NET Framework version and to adopt the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package.\r\n\r\nWe decided to remove support for .NET 6 since it will go EOL shortly after this new package is released, even though .NET 6 will still be supported at the time. Publishing a .NET 8 library significantly simplifies the plan, both in terms of what we will deliver and what we need to explain.\r\n\r\nFor .NET dates, see [.NET Releases.](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md) .NET 9 will [GA in November](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md) of this year. .NET 8 will go EOL in November, 2026.\r\n\r\nThe current package version of [System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient) is 4.8.6, at the time of writing. These changes will be made with a 5.0.0 version and later.\r\n\r\n**Note:** _This deprecation doesn’t apply to the System.Data.SqlClient namespace in .NET Framework._\r\n\r\n### Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\r\n\r\nDaily downloads of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient on nuget.org are nearing 50% higher than System.Data.SqlClient. We expect the gap in usage between the two libraries will continue to increase. Microsoft.Data.SqlClient is the best library we offer to access SQL Server.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to providing high-quality, performance-driven, and secure data access technologies. We strongly encourage users to transition to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. It is actively maintained and supports the latest SQL Server features.\r\n\r\n### How to migrate? \r\n\r\nAdd the NuGet package to your project, then update your references and using statements. Our [porting cheat sheet](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/blob/master/porting-cheat-sheet.md) provides a step-by-step set of changes you may need to make.\r\n\r\n1. **Update your project references:** Replace references to System.Data.SqlClient with Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.\r\n2. **Modify your using statements:** Update your using statements in your code files from System.Data.SqlClient to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.\r\n3. **Test your application:** Thoroughly test your application to ensure that it works as expected after the migration.\r\n\r\nWe also plan to [support semi-automatic migration](https://github.com/dotnet/upgrade-assistant/issues/1593) via [.NET Upgrade Assistant](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/upgrade-assistant).\r\n\r\n**Support & Feedback:** If you have any questions or need assistance with the migration, please reach out through our [official support channels](https://support.microsoft.com/) or join the discussion on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues).\r\n\r\n**Resources**\r\n- [Frequently Asked Questions - dotnet/SqlClient Wiki - GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions)\r\n- [Introduction to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient namespace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/introduction-microsoft-data-sqlclient-namespace?view=sql-server-ver16)\r\n- [SQL Server and ADO.NET (Microsoft.Data.SqlClient)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/sql)\r\n- [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient API Browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/322","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Announcement: System.Data.SqlClient package is now deprecated\" (#322)"},{"Id":"2464032272","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-13T19:08:47","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"321","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 9 Preview 7","State":"open","Body":"We are pleased to announce the release of .NET 9 Preview 7.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nAs [announced earlier](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/293), starting with .NET 9, we no longer include an implementation of `BinaryFormatter` in the runtime (.NET Framework remains unchanged). The APIs are still present, but their implementation always throws an exception, regardless of project type. Hence, setting the existing backwards compatibility flag is no longer sufficient to use `BinaryFormatter`.\r\n\r\n* We published the [BinaryFormatter migration guide][migration-guide]. We'd appreciate if could give it a read and give us feedback by filling issues in the [dotnet/docs] repo.\r\n* If you experience issues related to BinaryFormatter's removal not addressed in this migration guide, please file an issue in the [dotnet/runtime][dotnet/runtime] repo and indicate that the issue is related to the removal of `BinaryFormatter`.\r\n\r\n### Why was it removed?\r\n\r\n*[Docs][security-guide]*\r\n\r\nThe primary reason is that BinaryFormatter is unsafe. Any deserializer, binary or text, that allows its input to carry information about the objects to be created is a security problem waiting to happen. There is a common weakness enumeration (CWE) that describes the issue: [CWE-502 \"Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"][CWE502]. `BinaryFormatter` is such a deserializer. We also cover this in the [BinaryFormatter security guide][security-guide].\r\n\r\n### What are my options to move forward?\r\n\r\n*[Docs][migration-guide]*\r\n\r\nYou have two options to address the removal of `BinaryFormatter`'s implementation:\r\n\r\n1. **Migrate away from BinaryFormatter**. We strongly recommend you to investigate options to stop using `BinaryFormatter` due to the associated security risks. The [BinaryFormatter migration guide][migration-guide] lists several options.\r\n\r\n2. **Keep using BinaryFormatter**. If you need to continue using `BinaryFormatter` in .NET 9, you need to depend on the unsupported [System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters][compat-pack] NuGet package, which restores the unsafe legacy functionality and replaces the throwing implementation.\r\n\r\n[compat-pack]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-migration-guide/compatibility-package\r\n[migration-guide]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-migration-guide/\r\n[security-guide]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-security-guide\r\n[CWE502]: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html\r\n[dotnet/docs]: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=01-general-issue.yml\r\n[dotnet/runtime]: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/new\r\n\r\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/106240.

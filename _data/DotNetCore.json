It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

Forcing enumeration early is easy, familiar, and reads nicely:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\n// Goal: enumerate the iterator method ReadHeaderLines completely,\r\n// and call ReadBody only afterward.\r\n[.. ReadHeaderLines().ToList(), ReadBody()]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only downside is that this allocates an intermediate `List<T>` or `T[]`. However, this intermediate allocation is immediately spread, so the compiler could elide the allocation at its discretion without language users being able to tell the difference. This is in line with tentative plans to do similar eliding of collection instances in `foreach (var x in new[] { a, b, c })` and stack-allocating instead.\r\n\r\nThe important part would be that the semantics are preserved: enumeration of `ReadHeaderLines()` must finish before the evaluation of `ReadHeaderLines().ToList()` completes. Even with the ToList call being elided as a compiler optimization, the call is still there in concept, and is still causing enumeration to happen as part of evaluating the spread expression.\r\n\r\nOnly Enumerable.ToList/ToArray should be elided. Instance ToArray methods such as ConcurrentDictionary.ToArray can't be elided without changing the semantics.

reference to App_Code.dll while coding.","State":"open","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Visual-Studio-keeps-losing-reference-to-/10180388)._\n\n---\n[severity:It's more difficult to complete my work] [regression]\nWhen working with an ASP.NET Web Site solution after a few minutes of code changes and updates VS starts to report that I need to add a reference to App_Code.dll. This doesn't happen immediately after opening the solution it takes a few minutes of making changes for it to occur. There doesn't seem to be any exact action or changes that cause it to happen. \n\nI've tried rebuilding the web site, the solution, just the web page. the solution compiles fine and none of those actions fixes it. The only solution I've found that works temporarily is closing VS and deleting the \"root\" folder in \"Temporary ASP.NET Files\" folder. After doing that I can reopen the solution and the issue is no longer there but then after a few minutes of changes it comes right back. \n\nIf I double click on the error to go to the location in code where the reference is needed. I can right click on the ClassList property and select 'Go To Definition' and VS shows me a decompiled version of the WebUserControl source code instead of going to the actual code file.  See additional screen shot included.\n\nI appears to me that when I make changes, VS will recompile those changes in the background to update intellisense and for some reason loses reference to the temp dll files. \n\nThis issue is causing my productivity to be slowed because I'm constantly having to navigate the list of errors to see the real ones, I can't use any of the code navigation shortcuts because VS seems to think there's no symbols for the code. \n\n\nI created a simple test solution to test this and was able to make it happen. WebSiteTest.zip\nIf you open this solution as a web site and just start making changes to the code between the App_Code folder, the user control and the web page. After a few minutes the error starts to show.\n\nI used the \"Record your actions\" option in the report hoping to capture what's happening, but I kept getting other errors so I'm not sure if that was because of the recording or not. And of course, as soon as I stopped recording the App_Code.dll reference issue happened within minutes.\n\nExample Error: BC30652\t_Reference required to assembly 'App_Code.j0ud00zh, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' containing the type 'Class1'. Add one to your project._\t\n\nI also have this issue in VS 2019 and I moved to VS 2022 hoping the newer version might solve it, but the issue still remains. So, I'm reporting this as a VS 2022 issue.\n\n\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 10/24/2022, 09:37 PM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n#### Feedback Bot on 10/31/2022, 04:58 AM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n#### Bill Hiebert [MSFT] on 3/3/2023, 02:14 PM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n#### Dave Polomis on 3/14/2023, 05:57 PM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n#### Bill Hiebert [MSFT] on 3/20/2023, 00:17 PM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n#### Feedback Bot on 4/24/2023, 07:47 AM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n#### Feedback Bot on 6/1/2023, 01:20 AM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n#### Feedback Bot on 6/29/2023, 11:51 AM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n\n---\n### Original Solutions\n(no solutions)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/70155","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Visual Studio keeps losing reference to App_Code.dll while coding.\" (#70155)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"SDK-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1916481176","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-29T02:07:59","Actor":"github-actions[bot]","Number":"35765","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/8.0.1xx] Avoid running new APIs under older TFMs","State":"closed","Body":"Backport of #35636 to release/8.0.1xx\n\n/cc @captainsafia","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/35765","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/8.0.1xx] Avoid running new APIs under older TFMs\" (#35765)"},{"Id":"1917684007","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-28T23:35:05","Actor":"github-actions[bot]","Number":"35776","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/8.0.1xx] Skip getting Windows GUI bit on non-Windows in AppHostShellShimMaker","State":"closed","Body":"Backport of #35600 to release/8.0.1xx\n\n/cc @elinor-fung","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/35776","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/8.0.1xx] Skip getting Windows GUI bit on non-Windows in AppHostShellShimMaker\" (#35776)"},{"Id":"1918244889","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-28T22:36:17","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"35783","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/8.0.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/fsharp","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:d51edde1-9444-43d8-9e9a-08db9f47cad7)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp\r\n- **Subscription**: d51edde1-9444-43d8-9e9a-08db9f47cad7\r\n- **Build**: 20230928.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: September 28, 2023 8:08:40 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 38b2bac6361e9b75dc2b51c0f2b78b008872767d\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/dev17.8\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

With the .NET 8 SDK this is no longer the case. Even for correctly multi-targeted libraries, the netstandard output assembly will no longer contain the `IsTrimmable` attribute. We debated whether it was worth warning in this case, but decided that the negative impact of the warning on library developers following the \"golden path\" was too large to justify keeping this as a warning.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/35528","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/35767","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Detect correctly multitargeted apps for trim/AOT/single-file warnings\" (#35767)"},{"Id":"1916387845","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-09-27T23:17:41","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"35763","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/8.0.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/windowsdesktop","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:Coherency Updates)\r\n## Coherency Updates\r\n\r\nThe following updates ensure that dependencies with a *CoherentParentDependency*\r\nattribute were produced in a build used as input to the parent dependency's build.\r\nSee [Dependency Description Format](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/Documentation/DependencyDescriptionFormat.md#dependency-description-overview)\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Coherency Updates**:\r\n  -

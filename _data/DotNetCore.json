The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"702426498","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-16T06:07:11","Actor":"billvenhaus","Number":"1774","RawContent":null,"Title":"[UWP] HttpClientHandler - Digest Authentication Broken on Windows 10 PC","State":"closed","Body":"Just recently I found that my UWP app can no longer connect with Digest authentication on Windows 10 PCs.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption.

However, this conflicts with the simplifying assumption we made by calling `SetCount` then `AsSpan` just once. We'd get bad results if we, for example, just called AddRange on the underlying list--elements would be added at the wrong position, and so on. We'd have to do some kind of interleaving of SetCount+AsSpan/AddRange/SetCount+AsSpan/... to make things work.\r\n\r\nThe impl of List.AddRange is useful as a point of reference here: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/6f30b7500ea2c0d0fb2923ea1fc5ed3c4ce2f29c/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Collections/Generic/List.cs#L243\r\n\r\nWhat we would ideally do to make it straightforward to insert the spread elements is either:\r\n1. access the underlying array of the List and pass it in to ICollection<T>.CopyTo(T[], index), as AddRange is doing internally\r\n2. Use a runtime API under consideration to try and convert IEnumerables to ReadOnlySpan, then use CopyTo: dotnet/runtime#58821\r\n3. Use some hypothetical new CollectionsMarshal API to, for example, create a `T[]` and move ownership of it to a new `List<T>`\r\n\r\nNote that even if we had say, `[bunch, of, scalars, ..spread1, bunch, of, scalars]`, where `spread1` is convertible to ICollection but not Span, it might still be desirable to use `AsSpan`, as it does seem to meaningfully reduce the overhead of inserting the scalar elements into the list compared to calling `Add`. So, we wouldn't want to necessarily see a spread of an ICollection and fall back to completely using Add/AddRange instead of Span.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/71273","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Rationalize spread optimization targeting List when collection-expr contains spread values of ICollection type\" (#71273)"},{"Id":"2042603766","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-15T00:21:22","Actor":"dibarbet","Number":"71269","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"Merge pull request #71258 from mavasani/RemoveFadingDiagnostics\"","State":"closed","Body":"This reverts commit dac459979942d53af078c91507d7118b332d841f, reversing changes made to 5249865bc562b64333ae80de6ccb47e7881b7840.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/71269","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"Merge pull request #71258 from mavasani/RemoveFadingDiagnostics\"\" (#71269)"},{"Id":"2042640873","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-14T23:11:27","Actor":"AlekseyTs","Number":"71271","RawContent":null,"Title":"Params Collections: Implement \"Better function member\" section of the proposal","State":"open","Body":"https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/pull/7768","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/71271","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Params Collections: Implement \"Better function member\" section of the proposal\" (#71271)"},{"Id":"2042614260","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-14T22:42:50","Actor":"RikkiGibson","Number":"71270","RawContent":null,"Title":"Store the dest collection as span to a temp for CopyTo optimization","State":"open","Body":"We removed the span temp for now per https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/71195#discussion_r1425751607.\r\n\r\nWe'd like to reintroduce the span temp later, perhaps only when non-async, or when lowering can prove that the span will not be used across an await boundary, or perhaps even reinitializing the span temp when it is used across an await boundary.\r\n\r\nThis would result in a maybe 2% perf improvement for CopyTo codegen.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nT[] result = [..arr1, ..arr2];\r\n\r\n// currently becomes\r\n((Span<T>)arr1).CopyTo((Span<T>)result).Slice(...));\r\n((Span<T>)arr2).CopyTo((Span<T>)result).Slice(...));\r\n\r\n// we could instead do:\r\nSpan<T> spanTemp = result;\r\n((Span<T>)arr1).CopyTo(spanTemp.Slice(...));\r\n((Span<T>)arr2).CopyTo(spanTemp.Slice(...));\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/71270","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Store the dest collection as span to a temp for CopyTo optimization\" (#71270)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"SDK-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2045646154","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-18T03:07:56","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"37571","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/runtime","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:Coherency Updates)\r\n## Coherency Updates\r\n\r\nThe following updates ensure that dependencies with a *CoherentParentDependency*\r\nattribute were produced in a build used as input to the parent dependency's build.\r\nSee [Dependency Description Format](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/Documentation/DependencyDescriptionFormat.md#dependency-description-overview)\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Coherency Updates**:\r\n  -

This case is problematic. If you try to register it as 32-bit COM component, the client gets 0x800700C1 (\"not a valid Win32 application\").\r\n\r\nIf an assembly targets the architecture Any CPU then two .comhost.dll files\r\nshould be generated, because the autor may want to create both x64 and x86 COM servers from the same .NET \"Any CPU\" assembly (ex: consider a .NET-based add-in for Office 64-bit and Office 32-bit). That was possible with .NET Framework with a single build, but it is not possible with .NET Core: two builds are required, one for architecture x86 and another for architecture x64, and you need to move the output files before the second build.\r\n\r\nI suggest the following approach:\r\n\r\n* If the .NET Core assembly uses architecture x86 a .comhost32.dll file is generated for 32-bit\r\n* If the .NET Core assembly uses architecture x64 a .comhost64.dll file is generated for 64-bit\r\n* If the .NET Core assembly uses architecture Any CPU, both .comhost32.dll and .comhost64.dll files are generated.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/37570","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Generate comhost.dll for multiple runtimes\" (#37570)"},{"Id":"2045273550","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-17T16:01:33","Actor":"joegoldman2","Number":"37569","RawContent":null,"Title":"Code-style analysis rules not included with `AnalysisLevel` = `latest`","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nUsing a non-stable version (like `9.0.100-alpha.1.23615.9` in my case) of the SDK and with `AnalysisLevel` sets to `latest`, analysislevel_\\*.globalconfig is included but not analysislevelstyle_\\*.editorconfig.\r\n\r\nTarget `AddGlobalAnalyzerConfigForPackage_MicrosoftCodeAnalysisNetAnalyzers`:\r\n\r\n![net_analyzers](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/assets/147369450/ca1b5fd4-76cb-4937-80d3-922993bd57e1)\r\n\r\nTarget `AddGlobalAnalyzerConfigForPackage_MicrosoftCodeAnalysisCSharpCodeStyle`:\r\n\r\n![code_style](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/assets/147369450/9181f044-93d5-4eca-a1b1-5709e58a88f9)\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n1 - Run `dotnet new console --framework net9.0`\r\n2 - Edit the csproj and program.cs:\r\n```diff\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>\r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>\r\n+   <AnalysisLevel>latest</AnalysisLevel>\r\n+   <AnalysisMode>All</AnalysisMode>\r\n+   <EnforceCodeStyleInBuild>true</EnforceCodeStyleInBuild>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n```diff\r\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello, World!\");\r\n\r\n// 👇 IDE0040 'Accessibility modifiers required' should be normally raised here\r\n+ class Test\r\n+ {\r\n+ }\r\n```\r\n3 - Run `dotnet build`\r\n\r\n### Expected\r\n\r\nIt seems a little odd that the editorconfig for `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers` package is included but not the one for `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.CodeStyle` which is only included when `AnalysisLevel` is set to `preview` in this case.

The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n#### **Fine tuning the patch**\r\nThe patch introduces two new AppContext properties: \r\n\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxEnhanceYourCalmCount `\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize `\r\n\r\nThe properties can be set in a [variety](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime-config/) of ways, including AppContext.SetData or AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetData in code (the former is not available in 6.0), RuntimeHostConfigurationOption in a project file, or environment variables. \r\n\r\nMaxEnhanceYourCalmCount is a cap on how many ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM (EYC) messages (generally triggered by excessive client stream resets) the server can send per second on a particular connection without dropping it.  The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

All new repos will already use this naming. Over the next couple of months, we're going to rename the branches in our existing repos as well. We're using [GitHub's new tooling](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-01-19-support-for-renaming-an-existing-branch/) to make sure branch policies and PRs are automatically updated.\r\n\r\nHowever, this still requires some changes from you as well. This announcement describes the process and what you need to do on your end.\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a smaller list of repos and grow from there. Theses are the planned starting repos:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/project-system](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system)\r\n* [dotnet/llvm-project](https://github.com/dotnet/llvm-project)\r\n* [dotnet/icu](https://github.com/dotnet/icu)\r\n* [dotnet/xharness](https://github.com/dotnet/xharness)\r\n* [mono/linker](https://github.com/mono/linker)\r\n* [dotnet/docker-tools](https://github.com/dotnet/docker-tools)\r\n* [dotnet/wcf](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf)\r\n* [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore)\r\n\r\nWe're starting with a smaller list to ensure we catch all cases where need to update corresponding configuration in our Arcade-based tooling (see [this fantastic blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/) on how we build .NET).\r\n\r\nOnce we have validated our checklist, each repo admin will rename the default branch at their own pace. We expect to complete all repos in the next couple of months.\r\n\r\n## What you can expect\r\n\r\n*We have a detailed guide you can find at <https://aka.ms/m2m-dotnet>. This is only the essentials.*\r\n\r\nWe'll add a sticky issue to each repo when we're about to rename the branch. We'll do this a few days before and we'll leave it there for two weeks.\r\n\r\n**You don't need to update your PRs**. If you submitted a PR against the old default branch, the GitHub tooling will automatically retarget your PR against the new default branch (main).\r\n\r\nFor sanity, **you should rename the default branch in your fork as well**.

Particularly `_EH_prolog3_catch_GS_align`/`_EH_epilog3_GS_align` had a `mov esp, ebx` instruction the lazy unwinding didn't handle. This helper ended up getting called by 3 FCalls in all coreclr: \r\n\r\n- `DebugDebugger::Log`\r\n- `StubHelpers::ValidateObjec`\r\n- `COMDelegate::BindToMethodName`\r\n\r\n# Customer Impact\r\n\r\nCustomers will see seeing seemingly random behavior once one of these stubs is hit. This manifests as GC holes where the stack walking caused the GC to not find stack roots, effectively unrooting object with references in the stack. A customer reported this from their use of `Debug.WriteLine` .\r\n\r\n# Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, with respect to previous releases. The regression was caused by a native toolset update in the build agents.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\nA repro app that used to crash in under a second using GC stress ran successfully for 12+hrs with no issues. \r\n\r\n# Risk\r\n\r\nVery targeted fix, both @jkotas and I have stepped through the unwinder logic and it's as minimally invasive as possible while preserving correctness.

A fix would be nice]\r\nC# 9.0 enables extension `GetEnumerator` support for `foreach` loops:\n\n[What's new in C# 9.0] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-9)\n\nIf there is no instance `GetEnumerator` method and there is more than one reachable `GetEnumerator` extension method, the C# compiler correctly chooses the closest one. For instance:\n\n```c#\nusing System.Collections;\nusing Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;\nusing UnitTestProject1;\n\nnamespace UnitTestProject1\n{\n    [TestClass]\n    public class UnitTest1\n    {\n        [TestMethod]\n        public void TestMethod1()\n        {\n            var c = new C();\n            foreach (var i in c) ;\n        }\n    }\n\npublic class C { }\n\npublic static class Extensions\n    {\n        public static IEnumerator GetEnumerator(this C c) => new int[0]. GetEnumerator(); // The compiler chooses this extension method.\n    }\n}\n\npublic static class Extensions\n{\n    public static IEnumerator GetEnumerator(this C c) => new int[0]. GetEnumerator();\n}\n```\n\nThe previous example compiles and runs just fine. However, IntelliSense incorrectly flags the usage of variable `c` in the `foreach` loop, stating:\n\n`Type 'UnitTestProject.C' cannot be used in 'foreach' statement because it neither implements 'IEnumerable' or 'IEnumerable<T>', nor has suitable 'GetEnumerator' method which return type has 'Current' property and 'MoveNext' method`\n\nRemoving either of the extension methods causes the flag to go away.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 2/11/2021, 09:35 PM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

Fix lazy machine state unwinding for MSVC epilogues on x86","State":"open","Body":"# Description\r\n\r\nMSVC introduced changes into their prologue/epilogue helpers. Particularly `_EH_prolog3_catch_GS_align`/`_EH_epilog3_GS_align` had a `mov esp, ebx` instruction the lazy unwinding didn't handle. This helper ended up getting called by 3 FCalls in all coreclr: \r\n\r\n- `DebugDebugger::Log`\r\n- `StubHelpers::ValidateObjec`\r\n- `COMDelegate::BindToMethodName`\r\n\r\n# Customer Impact\r\n\r\nCustomers will see seeing seemingly random behavior once one of these stubs is hit. This manifests as GC holes where the stack walking caused the GC to not find stack roots, effectively unrooting object with references in the stack. A customer reported this from their use of `Debug.WriteLine` .\r\n\r\n# Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, with respect to previous releases. The regression was caused by a native toolset update in the build agents.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\nA repro app that used to crash in under a second using GC stress ran successfully for 12+hrs with no issues. \r\n\r\n# Risk\r\n\r\nVery targeted fix, both @jkotas and I have stepped through the unwinder logic and it's as minimally invasive as possible while preserving correctness.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly \r\n                 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0\"\r\n\r\n2. It builds fine but on app launch it crashes with:\r\n\r\n                 \"Could not load file or assembly 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51' \r\n                 or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"705166145","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-20T19:05:41","Actor":"Korporal","Number":"1775","RawContent":null,"Title":"Confusing behavior when using AssemblyInfo.cs ","State":"open","Body":"I'm completely perplexed.\r\n\r\nI created a .Net Standard 2.0 library project.\r\n\r\nI explicity added an AssemblyInfo.cs file, we need this because we use this utility to \"stamp\" our assemblies when we build them:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ygoe/NetRevisionTool\r\n\r\nThat utility is run as a pre/post build event and temporarily replaces placeholders in the AssemblyInformationalVersion attribute with runtime values (like repo folder name, commit ID, branch etc etc).\r\n\r\nThe completed assembly then has this info \"burned\" into it as we go forward.\r\n\r\n.Net Standard is not working with this.\r\n\r\n1.

when combining exception filtering and pattern matching","State":"closed","Body":"Hey all, \r\n\r\nNot sure if this falls under the compiler team or the language team. This is something that came up while handling errors in a microservice I'm writing. I tend to heavily use the pattern matching features of the language and so I naturally used the 'is' construct with assignment to pattern match an InnerException in an Exception Filter expression. I didn't know if it would work but it compiled and I think the behaviour was undesirable and probably should be identified\r\n\r\n**Version Used**: \r\nUnsure how to find this but currently using VS2019 Version 16.8.5\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\n1.

to control which browser is launched, with command line arguments.\r\n\r\nParticularly when working with Blazor, which requires a bunch of arguments to be passed to Edge, Chrome etc to enable the Dev Tools experience, e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nchrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=\"C:\\Users\\mark\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\blazor-chrome-debug\" https://localhost:5001/\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently when working with Blazor, `dotnet run` launches the system default browser, then you hit `Alt+Shift+D` to open the developer tools, then you get the page telling you how to re-launch the browser from `Win+R`, and it's a drag.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/16051","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide a way to override the system default browser in launchSettings.json\"

discovered by `dotnet restore/build/test`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a solution with the solution files having extensions in uppercase characters. The solution should have a unit test, to check the functionality of `dotnet test`.\r\n2. Execute `dotnet restore` from PowerShell and observe it works fine.\r\n3. Execute `dotnet build` from PowerShell and observe it works fine.\r\n4. Execute `dotnet test` from PowerShell and observe it works fine.\r\n5. Remove all build artefacts or create a .DOCKERIGNORE file.\r\n6.

All new repos will already use this naming. Over the next couple of months, we're going to rename the branches in our existing repos as well. We're using [GitHub's new tooling](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-01-19-support-for-renaming-an-existing-branch/) to make sure branch policies and PRs are automatically updated.\r\n\r\nHowever, this still requires some changes from you as well. This announcement describes the process and what you need to do on your end.\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a smaller list of repos and grow from there. Theses are the planned starting repos:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/project-system](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system) ✔ \r\n* [dotnet/llvm-project](https://github.com/dotnet/llvm-project) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/icu](https://github.com/dotnet/icu) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/xharness](https://github.com/dotnet/xharness) ✔\r\n* [mono/linker](https://github.com/mono/linker) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/docker-tools](https://github.com/dotnet/docker-tools) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/wcf](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/iot](https://github.com/dotnet/iot) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms) ✔\r\n\r\nWe're starting with a smaller list to ensure we catch all cases where we need to update corresponding configuration in our Arcade-based tooling (see [this fantastic blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/) on how we build .NET).\r\n\r\nOnce we have validated our checklist, each repo admin will rename the default branch at their own pace. We expect to complete all repos in the next couple of months.\r\n\r\n## What you can expect\r\n\r\n*We have a detailed guide you can find at <https://aka.ms/m2m-dotnet>. This is only the essentials.*\r\n\r\nWe'll add a sticky issue to each repo when we're about to rename the branch. We'll do this a few days before and we'll leave it there for two weeks.\r\n\r\n**You don't need to update your PRs**. If you submitted a PR against the old default branch, the GitHub tooling will automatically retarget your PR against the new default branch (main).\r\n\r\nFor sanity, **you should rename the default branch in your fork as well**. When you go to your fork, GitHub will guide you through this experience:\r\n\r\n![Rename branch in fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/105210186-92bdba80-5aff-11eb-99c9-0beb708fcf3f.png)\r\n\r\n**You will need to update the repos you cloned to your hard drive**.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported.

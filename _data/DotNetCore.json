<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

Behavior**:\n\nThe compiler should decide that `Write(byte[])` is the better overload because it has an exact type match.\n\n**Actual Behavior**:\n\n`byte[]` is implicitly converted to `ReadOnlySpan<byte>` and then to `Utf8String`, so `Write(Utf8String)` is chosen."},{"Id":"49043558040","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-04-25T00:50:54","Actor":"333fred","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78313","RelatedDescription":"Opened

The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

This template will help us gather the information we need to start the review process.\n-->\n\n## Summary\n\nOffer \"Implement interface\" in type declaration body block too when it is empty yet.\n\n## Background and Motivation\n\n\"Implement interface\" is only offered in the type declaration signature scope so far.\n\nWhile it is intuitive to declare the skeleton of the type first:\n\n```cs\nclass C : I\n{\n    $$ // you end up here after declaration\n    // next step is to start implementation\n}\n```\n\nTo invoke the \"Implement interface\" code fix, you need to go back to the signature span:\n\n```cs\nclass C : I$$\n{\n}\n```\n\n## Proposed Feature\n\nSo, it would be intuitive and handy if we could call \"Implement interface\" right here:\n\n```cs\ninterface I \n{\n    void M();\n}\n\nclass C : I\n{\n    $$\n}\n```\n\nTo not get too intrusive (and display this code fix anywhere anytime in the body block), the availability could be limited to a few cases where it makes sense. For a start:\n- offer the code fix inside the declaration body block only when it is empty (trivia-only)\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\nI'm aware that the \"Implement interface\" can be invoked on a \"partially\" completed declaration too, where only the signature is there and there are no braces yet (e.g. `class C : I`, and it is going to add them as well, but most people may not.\n\nA similar experience is \"Implement with Copilot\" for `throw new NotImplementedException();`-bodied methods.\n\n(In this proposal I refer to the symbolic \"Implement interface\" code fix and not the newly introduced Copilot-based implementation.)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/78294","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Offer \"Implement interface\" in type declaration body block too when empty\" (#78294)"},{"Id":"3015453348","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-24T03:26:55","Actor":"elinor-fung","Number":"78288","RawContent":null,"Title":"CS8629 when checking `HasValue` by first assigning it to a local variable","State":"closed","Body":"**Version Used**: \n.NET 10.0.100-preview.4.25222.15\n`csc -version`: 5.0.0-1.25220.1 (02425481)\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\n\n```c#\npublic enum MyEnum { Default }\npublic MyEnum Method_Warning(MyEnum? val)\n{\n    bool hasValue = val.HasValue;\n    if (!hasValue)\n    {\n        val = MyEnum.Default;\n    }\n\n    return val.Value; // warning CS8629: Nullable value type may be null.\n}\n\npublic MyEnum Method_NoWarning(MyEnum? val)\n{\n    if (!val.HasValue)\n    {\n        val = MyEnum.Default;\n    }\n\n    return val.Value;\n}\n```\n[SharpLab](https://sharplab.io/#v2:EYLgxg9gTgpgtADwGwBYA+ABATARgLABQGAzAATakDCpA3oaQ+WTAHYCuAtqQLICeAouy41SAERgAzAIZsANgBdSAX3qMSPAUJ4x5ACwgATAPoB1KVBYBLFgHMAFH0GcA/KQBuU2QEpVDOgUZA0mAICFlSXSkAZwA1TzYYUgBed08AOgAJaLjZBIBuXyDLCVI7AEJI2PiYHwCgv0L6hg9wlMchNPFpOXkCuvqVAka1AHZU2TSc/MLBwvV2zm09QyMAOQgzC2t7BY5XFtrA/ybSYtKylszs6sOm45PGFuSNJw5OyRkFPpPZ/qCMMaXKYwb6MQZKIA)\n\n**Diagnostic Id**:\n\nwarning CS8629: Nullable value type may be null.\nIf this is a report about a bug in an analyzer, please include the diagnostic ID and message if possible (e.g. `\"IDE0030: Use coalesce expression\"`).\n\n**Expected Behavior**:\n\nNo warnings.\n\n**Actual Behavior**:\n\nCS8629 is fired for `Method_Warning`, which assigns `val.HasValue` to a local and checks that local.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/78288","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"CS8629 when checking `HasValue` by first assigning it to a local variable\" (#78288)"},{"Id":"3015542283","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-24T02:03:39","Actor":"davidwengier","Number":"78291","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix MEF composition for Razor","State":"closed","Body":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78122 broke Razor tests, because we now have to initialize the export provider builder first.\r\nInitializing the export provider builder broke Razor tests, because I had an old copy of the EA dll laying around\r\nFixing the name of the EA dll broke Razor tests, because of a MEF composition error with the RazorTestLanguageServerFactory\r\nAnd thats how we got here.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78291","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix MEF composition for Razor\" (#78291)"},{"Id":"3015422166","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-24T00:20:48","Actor":"ryzngard","Number":"78286","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove unused reference","State":"closed","Body":"This is no longer used, which is fantastic!

Let's fix that.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/vscode-csharp/issues/8193\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78286","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Remove unused reference\" (#78286)"},{"Id":"3015526913","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-24T00:12:32","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"78290","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Automated] PRs inserted in VS build main-10523.80","State":"closed","Body":"[View Complete Diff of Changes](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/compare/3683d8b6bb9e0527b4e8a46c4885ef7177fefb38...05e49aa98995349ffa26a19020333293ffe99670?w=1)\n- [Allow Razor files to be additional documents in a misc files project](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78267)\n- [Hook up IDocumentServiceProvider in VS Code](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78266)\n- [Cache MEF catalog in servicehub process](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78122)\n- [Allow Razor cohosting to run in VS Code, and fix it in VS](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78167)\n- [Update 17.14 insertion title](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78258)\n- [Fix toolset package failing to build from clean state in VS](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78251)\n- [Use collection expressions](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78237)\n- [Clean up output capture on .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78205)\n- [Create a NuGet package for Microsoft.VisualStudio.LanguageServices.Xaml](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78206)\n- [EnC: Track stale projects](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78166)\n- [Do not offer 'use auto prop' on a ref returning property](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78226)\n- [Add cherry pick parameters to pipeline](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78178)\n- [Adding new EA api at 'Features' layer for unit testing ot use](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78175)\n- [Fix razor analyzer loading](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78116)\n- [Move DiagnosticService impl down to Features layer](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78155)\n- [Fix crash when converting primary constructor to normal constructor](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78234)\n- [Reduce LOH allocations in MetadataWriter](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78245)\n- [Support empty root namespaces in ResxSourceGenerator](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78233)\n- [Allocate slightly less in ImmutableArrayExtensions.ConditionallyDeOrder](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78235)\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/78290","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Automated] PRs inserted in VS build main-10523.80\" (#78290)"},{"Id":"3015479518","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T23:37:55","Actor":"DustinCampbell","Number":"78289","RawContent":null,"Title":"Edit & Continue support for field access in auto-properties","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #77951\r\n\r\nField access in auto-properties mostly already worked in EnC.\r\n\r\n- Update the EnC unit testing infrastructure to always run C# tests with the \"preview\" language version and VB tests with the \"latest\" language version.\r\n- Add unit test coverage\r\n- Fix small issue in the `AbstractEditAndContinueAnalyzer` to allow auto-properties to be detected from a set accessor.\r\n\r\ncc @tmat ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78289","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Edit & Continue support for field access in auto-properties\" (#78289)"},{"Id":"3015428017","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T22:57:17","Actor":"ToddGrun","Number":"78287","RawContent":null,"Title":"Switch Project data structures from ImmutableDictionary => Dictionary and lock","State":"open","Body":"Solution/Project classes keep several immutable dictionaries for mapping (Document/Project)Id to various data. ImmutableDictionaries are a fine (but slow) data structure when data between versions is to be shared, but none of the values in these ImmutableDictionaries persist between solution/project transformations. In fact, the only operation performed on these dictionaries is GetOrAdd calls. As immutable dictionaries are quite poor performing wrt lookups/adds, I thought I would try out two approaches to see if they showed improvements:\r\n\r\n1) Switch to ConcurrentDictionary (see https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78285).\r\n2) Switch to simple Dictionaries guarded by locks (this PR)\r\n\r\nI created test insertions for each of these PRs to gather speedometer numbers, particularly during the solution load of the c# editing speedometer test. The measurements below are from GC Heap Allocs and CPU samples for those tests under (Solution/Project).GetDocument calls \r\n\r\n1) ConcurrentDictionary change test insertion: https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_git/VS/pullrequest/631277\r\n2) Dictionary/lock test insertion: https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_git/VS/pullrequest/631278\r\n\r\n*** Baseline ***\r\nAlloc: 120 MB (1.0%)\r\nCPU:  560 ms (0.3%)\r\n\r\n*** Concurrent Dictionary ***\r\nAlloc: 59 MB\r\nCPU: 258 ms (0.1%)\r\n\r\n*** Dictionary with lock ***\r\nAlloc: 28 MB\r\nCPU: 172 ms (< 0.1%)\r\n\r\nSo, it looks like the best performing of the bunch is this PR, which uses simple dictionaries and locks, thus why I'm elevating this PR out of draft mode. The ConcurrentDictionary PR is interesting as the code changes are simple and do give a nice perf improvement.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78287","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Switch Project data structures from ImmutableDictionary => Dictionary and lock\" (#78287)"},{"Id":"3015404498","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T22:45:40","Actor":"ToddGrun","Number":"78285","RawContent":null,"Title":"*** WIP: Switch Project data structures from ImmutableDictionary => ConcurrentDictionary","State":"open","Body":"Will add more information if speedometer run provides compelling results\r\n\r\nCommit 1 test insertion: https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_git/VS/pullrequest/631104\r\nCommit 2 test insertion: https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_git/VS/pullrequest/631277","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/78285","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"*** WIP: Switch Project data structures from ImmutableDictionary => ConcurrentDictionary\" (#78285)"},{"Id":"3015372912","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-23T22:20:12","Actor":"AlekseyTs","Number":"78284","RawContent":null,"Title":"Override completion doesn't offer to override assignment operators","State":"open","Body":"```\nabstract class C1\n{\n    virtual public void operator ++() { }\n\n    virtual public void operator -=(int i) { }\n}\n\n\nclass C2 : C1\n{\n    override \n}\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/78284","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Override completion doesn't offer to override assignment operators\" (#78284)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"SDK-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"3018869228","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-25T03:02:37","Actor":"v-wuzhai","Number":"48713","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix launch profile test failure ","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/48713","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix launch profile test failure \" (#48713)"},{"Id":"3018851358","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-25T02:44:02","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"48712","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/10.0.1xx-preview4] Update dependencies from dotnet/msbuild","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:a6c3438a-454e-4026-99a5-2e8764ebb3c8)\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild\n- **Subscription**: [a6c3438a-454e-4026-99a5-2e8764ebb3c8](https://maestro.dot.net/subscriptions?search=a6c3438a-454e-4026-99a5-2e8764ebb3c8)\n- **Build**: [20250425.1](https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=11473012)\n- **Date Produced**: April 25, 2025 2:19:31 AM UTC\n- **Commit**: [d40ed5884d80b92a5fc13adadb5ab3a893243b52](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/commit/d40ed5884d80b92a5fc13adadb5ab3a893243b52)\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Updates**:\n  - **Microsoft.SourceBuild.Intermediate.msbuild**: [from 17.15.0-preview-25224-05 to 17.15.0-preview-25225-01][1]\n  - **Microsoft.Build**: [from 17.15.0-preview-25224-05 to 17.15.0-preview-25225-01][1]\n  - **Microsoft.Build.Localization**: [from 17.15.0-preview-25224-05 to 17.15.0-preview-25225-01][1]\n\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/compare/34ccf7f743...d40ed5884d\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\n\n\n[marker]: <> (End:a6c3438a-454e-4026-99a5-2e8764ebb3c8)\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/48712","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/10.0.1xx-preview4] Update dependencies from dotnet/msbuild\" (#48712)"},{"Id":"3018809382","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-25T02:06:51","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"48711","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Source code updates from dotnet/dotnet","State":"open","Body":"\n> [!NOTE]\n> This is a codeflow update.

The standalone SB pipeline will be retained as a backup for now.\r\n\r\nHere's a screenshot of the structure of the pipeline with these changes:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45fc5197-6218-4f70-a741-aaa280883d06)\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes on these changes:\r\n* Source build jobs are moved into a separate stage. This allows for an easier dev experience to evaluate the state of the pipeline. For example, a SB dev can easily see the state of SB without wading through all of the Microsoft jobs.\r\n* A separate SB validation stage exists which depends on the SB and Vertical stages since validating SB requires scenarios where packages produced by the Microsoft build get restored.\r\n* Due to limitations in AzDO YAML, it wasn't possible to continue defining template parameters by reference variable values. This is called out in a big comment block in eng/pipelines/templates/stages/source-build.yml. This complicates some of the logic in eng/pipelines/templates/stages/source-build-stages.yml by having to check the distro name for a bunch of conditions. But it also has benefits in simplifying the amount of fields that need to be set for the SB jobs.\r\n* The SB jobs were pulled out of the vmr-verticals.yml template. This was done because the \"VMR Final Join\" job depends on everything within the vmr-verticals.yml template. As you can see in the screenshot, we want SB validation to occur in parallel with the join job, so it was necessary to move things out of that template.\r\n* It was found that test exclusions for OmniSharp are no longer needed so those have been removed.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/48703","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[10.0.1xx-preview4] Consolidate UB and SB pipelines\" (#48703)"},{"Id":"3016899633","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-24T18:51:35","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"48692","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/10.0.1xx-preview4] Update dependencies from dotnet/msbuild","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:a6c3438a-454e-4026-99a5-2e8764ebb3c8)\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild\n- **Subscription**: [a6c3438a-454e-4026-99a5-2e8764ebb3c8](https://maestro.dot.net/subscriptions?search=a6c3438a-454e-4026-99a5-2e8764ebb3c8)\n- **Build**: [20250424.5](https://dev.azure.com/devdiv/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=11466940)\n- **Date Produced**: April 24, 2025 10:56:03 AM UTC\n- **Commit**: [34ccf7f74382b73388ed97c3ff1d678b037a0647](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/commit/34ccf7f74382b73388ed97c3ff1d678b037a0647)\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Updates**:\n  -

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

You may need to make changes to adjust.\n\nTracking issue: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9674\n\n> .NET Team Status:\n> - azureedge.net scream tests are starting\n> - See: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9676\n\n>  \n> Recommended action:\n> - Read [Critical: .NET Install links are changing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/critical-dotnet-install-links-are-changing/) for an overview.\n> - Update `azureedge.net` references\n> - Update local copies of install script\n> - Update pinned references to [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n> - Validate that firewall rules are resilient to using new domains.\n> \n> Last update: 2025.01.23\n> Next update: 2025.02.04\n\n## Context\n\nSome .NET binaries and installers have been hosted on Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) domains that end in `.azureedge.net`. These domains were hosted by [edg.io](https://edg.io/), which has [ceased operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/edgio-retirement-faq) due to bankruptcy. We [migrated to a new CDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/migrate-cdn-to-front-door) and will be using new domains going forward. \n\nWe expect`azureedge.net` domains to cease by 5/31 (at latest).\n\n## .NET Team Remediation\n\nNew domains were created:\n\n- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` for signed official builds\n- `ci.dot.net` for unsigned builds\n\nTest links for new CDN:\n\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nTest links for old CDN:\n\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nThe following resources have been updated to use new domains.\n\n- [`releases-index.json`](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json)\n- [.NET install script](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/)\n- [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n- [CI short links](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/pull/15365)\n\nOther changes are in progress.\n\n## User Remediation\n\nPlease make the following replacements:\n\n- `dotnetcli.azureedge.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n- `dotnetbuilds.blob.core.windows.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n\nAll the new domains are path-compatible with old domains, as they share the same origin.\n\nPlease also make the following changes:\n\n- Update local copies of the install script\n- Update setup-dotnet Action references\n- Validate that firewall rules work with the new domains\n\n## Install script\n\nThe [.NET install script](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script) is used to install .NET from our CDN. We are changing CDNs (documented in a following section), which requires us to change the install script to use the new CDN.\n\nUpdated scripts:\n\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh`\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.ps1`\n\nNotes: \n\n- Users who have local copies of these scripts will need to update their copies.\n- Users who rely on the remote copy (at the URLs above) do not need to do anything other than validate no observed change in behavior (due to new domains and CDNs being used).\n\nTracking PRs:\n\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #554](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/554)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #555](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/555)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts/issues #558](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/issues/558)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #564](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/564)\n- [dotnet/docs #44052](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/44052)\n\n## Official builds\n\nOfficial builds and JSON files are hosted via a CDN, available for use by the install script and other installers.\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net\n\nNotes:\n\n- Official builds are tested and signed by Microsoft. A `microsoft.com` domain was chosen to reflect that.\n- We also [plan to stop using dowload.visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9675) for new content. That CDN will continue to function.\n- [Microsoft.Deployment.DotNet.Releases](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Deployment.DotNet.Releases) has been [updated](https://github.com/dotnet/deployment-tools/pull/423)\n\nYou can change from old to new domains by changing the domain section of the URL. The other parts of the URL do not need to change.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nA set of short links are available for official builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/dotnet-sdk-win-x64.zip\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-x64.tar.gz\n \nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- Currently forward to:  https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net.\n- Will be changed to forward to: https://build.dotnet.microsoft.com.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in mid January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/core #9683](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9683)\n\n## CI builds\n\nContinuous integration (CI) builds are hosted via a CDN, available via the install script and GitHub README files.\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net\n\nNote: CI builds include a mix of tested and untested builds, signed and unsigned builds.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n\nA set of short links are available for CI builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/daily/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/dotnet-runtime-win-x64.exe\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-arm.tar.gz\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/10.0.1xx/daily/dotnet-sdk-osx-arm64.pkg\n\nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- New builds now forward to: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old builds forward to:  https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in mid January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/core #9683](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9683)\n\nCI build pages use the CI short links.\n\nExample build pages:\n\n- [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/project/dogfooding.md#daily-builds-table)\n- [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/README.md#nightly-builds)\n- [dotnet/sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/documentation/package-table.md)\n\n## Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions\n\n- Major versions tags for [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570) have been updated. References to pinned versions will require updating to the most recent version.\n- We expect that GitHub Enterprise Server will be addressed in January.\n- Azure DevOps [`UseDotnetTask`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/use-dotnet-v2?view=azure-pipelines) will be updated in January\n- We do not yet have a date for updating [Azure DevOps Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/server/).\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/336","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Critical: .NET install domains and URLs are changing\" (#336)"},{"Id":"2653140062","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T19:35:17","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"335","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET November 2024 Updates","State":"open","Body":"# .NET November 2024 Updates\n\nToday, we are releasing .NET 9 , .NET 8.0.11, and .NET 6.0.36 updates.\n\n* https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9599 \n* [.NET 9.0 Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0)\n* [.NET 8.0.11 and .NET SDK 8.0.404](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/8.0/8.0.11/8.0.11.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0))\n* [.NET 6.0.36 and .NET SDK 6.0.427](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.36/6.0.36.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0))\n\nAlso announced at [.NET Updates in November 2024](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-and-dotnet-framework-november-2024-servicing-updates/).\n\nThis issue will be updated if there are any additional releases during the month.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/335","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET November 2024 Updates\" (#335)"},{"Id":"2653127024","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T19:27:36","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"334","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-43498 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-43498 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\n\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 9.0.

See that issue for discussion.\n\nWe'll be reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3 and encourage ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to update to it. In this post I'll provide more background.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> This post only applies if you're using ASP.NET Core **on .NET Framework**. If you're using ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Core 2.x, it is [already out of support][netcore-support], and you should upgrade to a supported version such as .NET 8.\n\n### Background\n\nEarly versions of ASP.NET Core were provided for .NET Framework and .NET Core. Since 2021, [ASP.NET Core 2.1 is supported][aspnet21-support] only when running on .NET Framework. ASP.NET Core 2.2 has been out of support on all platforms since 2019.\n\nThis happened before we had a [predictable schedule and alternate releases of Standard Term Support (STS) and Long Term Support (LTS)][core-release-policies]. Many users upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2, not realizing that this reduced their support duration.\n\nAs a result, we now have users that are running on the unsupported version of ASP.NET Core 2.2 on .NET Framework.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support        |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | [Supported][aspnet21-support] |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019       |\n\n### How to stay supported\n\n* If you're on .NET Core, you should upgrade to .NET 8 and use ASP.NET Core 8\n* If you're on .NET Framework, you can either migrate to .NET 8 or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.3, which is the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1 (see below)\n\nSince ASP.NET Core 2.x for .NET Framework is just a set of packages, downgrading isn't that easy; there are well over one hundred packages and not all of them have 2.x version numbers. To make matters worse, there are NuGet packages out there that also upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2. Downgrading to ASP.NET Core 2.1 would mean that NuGet fails to restore these dependencies with errors.\n\nIn order to make this easier, we'll reship ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, thus facilitating this downgrade as a package upgrade.\n\nYou might wonder why we don't reship ASP.NET Core 2.2 as 2.3 instead. The answer is breaking changes. ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago, while ASP.NET Core 2.1 kept being supported. We feel it would be wrong to force ASP.NET Core 2.1 users to accommodate those breaking changes in order to stay supported.\n\nUsers on ASP.NET Core 2.2 are unsupported and won't receive any security updates. Our priority is to help those users to get onto a supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework.\n\nBy reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, we provide users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 an off ramp to the supported version via a regular NuGet upgrade. Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 will also be pulled forward to 2.3, but since it's the same code as 2.1, there are no breaking changes. Moving forward, all updates to ASP.NET Core 2.1 will be published as 2.3. However, if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.1, you don't need to move to 2.3 in order to get updates. If we find security issues with 2.1 packages, those will be marked as vulnerable and the recommended version will be versioned as 2.3. Except for the version number changes, that's how ASP.NET Core 2.1 works today, so there are no changes for you and you don't need to preemptively update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 to receive those warnings.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n>\n> Please note that if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.2, you will *not* be getting vulnerability warnings via NuGet because the product is out of support. There is no change here, this has been the case since ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago. Therefore, if you're on ASP.NET Core 2.2, we strongly recommend to update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 as soon as possible in order to receive security fixes again.\n\nWe understand that this can be confusing, but we believe it's the best compromise to help ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to get back onto a supported train.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support                          |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | Supported with ASP.NET Core 2.3                 |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019                         |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.3 | [Supported, same code as 2.1][aspnet21-support] |\n\n### Summary\n\nFor .NET Core, ASP.NET Core 2.x is and remains unsupported.\n\nThe following statements are specific for ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Framework:\n\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.1 is and remains supported**.\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.2 is and remains unsupported**.\n* **We're re-versioning ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3** to allow ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to move to a supported version.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 should update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. Since it's the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1, there are no breaking changes or feature additions. This operation won't require any code changes on your side. But it will make your life easier as all future updates will be versioned as 2.3.x, so you'll have a consistent set of versions.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. This will ensure you get off of the unsupported version and thus will get security fixes. You should expect breaking changes as you're effectively downgrading to the code from ASP.NET Core 2.1. If you can't live without the features being added in ASP.NET Core 2.2, you'll have to migrate to a supported .NET version with those features, such as .NET 8.\n* **This does not extend or reduce the support durations of any products, nor which versions of .NET are supported where**. It's purely a re-versioning of ASP.NET Core 2.1 in order to help the math in the package manager. The net effect of this change is that the last supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework is also the highest minor version (2.3).\n\n[aspnet21-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/aspnet/2.1-packages\n[netcore-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core\n[core-release-policies]: https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-policies.md\n\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/58598.

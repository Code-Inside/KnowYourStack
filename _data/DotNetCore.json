You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.1 you should download and install Runtime 2.1.18 or SDK 2.1.515 (for Visual Studio 2017 v15.9), 2.1.612 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.0) or 2.1.807 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.2 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.1 you should download and install Runtime 3.1.4 or SDK 3.1.105 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.4) or 3.1.301 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.5 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1\r\n* For machines running .NET 5 Preview you should download and install .NET 5 Preview 4 when available from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple affected versions you must update the runtime or SDKs for each version.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the .NET Core Bug Bounty. Details of the .NET Core Bug Bounty including terms and conditions are at [https://aka.ms/corebounty](https://aka.ms/corebounty).\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET Core GitHub organization. The main repos are located at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime and https://github.com/dotnet/aspnet/. The Announcements repo (https://github.com/dotnet/Announcements) will contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue.

This is particularly profound in Office extensions since most inherit from `IDispatch`. The fact that this hasn't been reported seems to imply few customers are authoring Office extensions using .NET Core at present. As .NET 5 releases and adoption increases the assumption would be this issue will become more common.\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/38950 for user reported issue.\r\n\r\n.NET 5 PR: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/40228.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from .NET Framework and has been present since COM support was added to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nValidation of the above user scenario and updated tests in .NET 5 to verify the scenario. The test updates did not get ported to this PR but can be if those changes are desired. The minimum updates to tests were applied here to enable build and run of existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nThe risk of this change has two facets. It is possible .NET Core COM server authors have come to rely on this unusual behavior so it is possible we break someone. How that manifests would near impossible to determine given the fact that this is a bug in our following COM rules.\r\n\r\nThe change itself is isolated to COM scenarios only and has no impact on any scenario other than COM servers authored in .NET Core. This seems to be an acceptable risk given that the primary motivation for COM support was for Office and since few (read one) reports of the failure and it does impact the Office scenario the fix to follow the COM rules appears warranted.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28073","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[.NET Core 3.1] Don't rely on the built-in interface marshaller during COM activation.\" (#28073)"},{"Id":"670175635","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-11T23:15:55","Actor":"sdmaclea","Number":"28072","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix DataTargetReader::AlignBase()","State":"closed","Body":"## Summary\r\n\r\n#28033 added `DAC_ALIGNAS` macro to force MSVC and clang/gcc compilers layouts to match.

When a thread is created coreclr requests for the processor affinity of the new thread to be changed to the process' affinity, which is not allowed under Snap's strict confinement.\r\n- There are a couple of workarounds, but both involve manual/non-default steps (inconvenient) and give the process more control than desired:\r\n  - Specify the process-control plug and manually connect it before running the app\r\n  - Require the classic confinement instead and specify it when installing the app\r\n- The workarounds may also cause some difficulty, especially longer-term, for .NET Core apps to be added to the public snap store due to the extra control the process would require.\r\n  - It is possible to specify to auto-connect the process-control plug using store processes, but it requires review and justification, and the purpose of working around this issue may be difficult to justify longer-term\r\n  - Apps that use the classic confinement run without any sandboxing, and may not be allowed in the public snap store for the purpose of working around this issue\r\n  - See https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/1634#issuecomment-667332468 for more information\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- Tested a small app under Snap's strict confinement\r\n- PAL, coreclr, and libraries tests\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow:\r\n- Instead of the creating thread changing the affinity of the created thread, the created thread changes its own affinity after starting, the difference is mostly invisible\r\n- Where appropriate, used a fallback to use the pthread implementation for setting the affinity when sched_setaffinity is not available, so in the theoretical possibility of a different pthread implementation for setting the affinity, there would be no change from before","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28071","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[3.1] Change new thread's affinity after thread starts, from the same thread, as a workaround for Snap\" (#28071)"},{"Id":"668934448","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-30T17:04:31","Actor":"silvioguiso","Number":"28069","RawContent":null,"Title":"Decodes bitstream to string","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28069","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Decodes bitstream to string\" (#28069)"},{"Id":"665279560","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-28T18:29:19","Actor":"ViktorHofer","Number":"28066","RawContent":null,"Title":"Hardcode path to ICU on macOS","State":"closed","Body":"Port of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/commit/05f17e3170d014efe63202c4e7e7b641e8f8fef6.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28066","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Hardcode path to ICU on macOS\" (#28066)"},{"Id":"665280682","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-24T17:09:08","Actor":"ViktorHofer","Number":"28067","RawContent":null,"Title":"Hardcode path to ICU on macOS","State":"closed","Body":"Port of dotnet/runtime@05f17e3","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28067","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Hardcode path to ICU on macOS\" (#28067)"},{"Id":"664937647","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-24T06:02:10","Actor":"theaoqi","Number":"28065","RawContent":null,"Title":"[3.1] build.sh skipcrossgen failed","State":"open","Body":"dotnet/runtime has a new build system and I cannot reproduce this issue with dotnet/runtime.

Sends on a WebSocket can't run concurrently, and there's a lock that protects access to shared resources, including a pooled buffer.  The code that ends a send operation returns the buffer to the pool and releases the lock, but it does so in the opposite (wrong) order.  As such, a second concurrent send could end up trying to use the buffer concurrently with the first send operation releasing it.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nInitially reported as a sporadic ArgumentException that escapes from within the WebSocket implementation (from valid usage).  But in theory it could result in data corruption throughout the process, with a buffer being returned to the pool while it's still in use.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nLow.

The original comment was [here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/pull/3429#issuecomment-678569706) in the PR where I stumbled upon this bug. I've also already sent an email to the .NET Native team with a repro and a sample project that reproduces the issue.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nUsing a custom `ref T` returning delegate seems to trigger a build error on UWP. Consider this snippet:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic delegate ref T FieldAccessor<T>();\r\n\r\nprivate int n;\r\n\r\nprivate void Button_OnClick(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n    FieldAccessor<int> accessor = () => ref n;\r\n\r\n    accessor() = default;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreating a blank app and just adding that code results in the following error:\r\n\r\n> ILT0005: 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\UWPNuGetPackages\\runtime.win10-x64.microsoft.net.native.compiler\\2.2.8-rel-28605-00\\tools\\x64\\ilc\\Tools\\nutc_driver.exe @\"C:\\Users\\Sergio\\source\\repos\\FieldAccessorRepro\\FieldAccessorRepro\\obj\\x64\\Release\\ilc\\intermediate\\MDIL\\FieldAccessorRepro.rsp\"' returned exit code 2\r\n\r\nYou can find a full repro project to download [here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/files/5111764/FieldAccessorRepro.zip).\r\n\r\nThis bug is currently blocking one of the follow up PRs for the `Microsoft.Toolkit.Mvvm` package ([here](https://github.com/windows-toolkit/WindowsCommunityToolkit/issues/3428)), as it causes the build to just fail on UWP. I'm hoping this could be solved with some trick/workaround on the UWP side, as I'd really, really like not to be forced to alter the API surface on the .NET Standard side for a specific issue with the .NET Native compiler.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance! 😊","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/8273","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[.NET Native] ILT0005 build error with ref T returning delegate\" (#8273)"},{"Id":"682498755","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-20T07:43:54","Actor":"RalfKornmannEnvision","Number":"8272","RawContent":null,"Title":"Arm64","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/8272","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Arm64\" (#8272)"},{"Id":"682460020","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-20T06:36:00","Actor":"RalfKornmannEnvision","Number":"8271","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support for ARM64 on UNIX like systems compiler and runtime","State":"open","Body":"Implements most of the missing parts for ARM64 on UNIX like hosts.\r\n* Change section for native signature layout from read only to data for non Windows systems to avoid linker issues with absolute relocations between sections\r\n* Store CFI data for ARM64 non Windows builds\r\n* Add special ARM64 relocation types were needed\r\n* Implements functions to handle 28 bit offsets in ARM64 opcodes\r\n* Implements ARM64 instruction encoding\r\n* Implements helper nodes ARM64 code generators\r\n* Implements ARM64 intrinsic supports by following the XArch pattern\r\n* Implements runtime query and check of required intrinsics\r\n* Use special name for AssignRef helper functions as RyuJit uses a custom calling convention for these on ARM64 \r\n* Change relocation type for exception type in catch handler to avoid an assert in LLVM.

I\r\n     disabled them all together.\r\n\r\n4.Testing for C++/CLI. I fixed bug that in dotnet/sdk, the targeting\r\n  pack is still the stage0(the older SDK that is used to build this SDK)\r\n  version instead of what is in dotnet/sdk. However, that breaks all\r\n  C++/CLI testing in dotnet/sdk due to these targeting pack need to\r\n  download from the internet and C++/CLI does not support nuget restore.\r\n  I will only add few test in dotnet/installer instead. Since C++ nuget\r\n  restore support will be added later. And before that, there will be no\r\n  big new feature in C++/CLI.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files. But now you can enhance your localized Visual Studio development experience by adding the localized IntelliSense files from the download site into your local development environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, with this release we have made the localized IntelliSense available as zip archives that does require you to manually extract and copy the files to respective SDK install folders.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

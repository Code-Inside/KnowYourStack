The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

This caused the following problematic code to compile without errors:\n\n```csharp\nscoped Span<int> items1 = default;\nscoped Span<int> items2 = default;\nforeach (var x in new[] { 1, 2 })\n{\n    Span<int> items = [x];\n    if (x == 1)\n        items1 = items;  // Should be ERROR - but was allowed\n    if (x == 2)\n        items2 = items;  // Should be ERROR - but was allowed\n}\n\nConsole.Write(items1[0]); // Prints '2' - unexpected aliasing!\nConsole.Write(items2[0]); // Prints '2' - unexpected aliasing!\n```\n\nThe issue is that `items` is a collection expression created in the foreach loop body (a nested scope), but was being allowed to escape to the outer scope and be assigned to `items1` and `items2`. This is a correctness issue where the contents of spans are aliased unexpectedly.\n\n## Solution\n\nChanged two locations in `Binder.ValueChecks.cs`:\n\n1. **Line 4588** in `GetValEscape`: Changed `SafeContext.CurrentMethod` to `localScopeDepth`\n   - This ensures the method returns the actual scope depth where the collection expression was created\n\n2. **Line 5336** in `CheckValEscape`: Changed `SafeContext.CurrentMethod` to `escapeFrom`\n   - This ensures escape validation checks against the actual escape-from scope\n\n## Breaking Change\n\nThis is an intentional breaking change to fix incorrect code patterns. After this change, the problematic code above now correctly produces compilation errors:\n\n```\nerror CS8352: Cannot use variable 'items' in this context because it may expose \nreferenced variables outside of their declaration scope\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\n- Added breaking changes documentation in `docs/compilers/CSharp/Compiler Breaking Changes - DotNet 11.md` describing the change and providing workarounds\n\n## Test Updates\n\n- Updated 4 existing tests that were incorrectly expecting the unsafe code to compile\n- Added a new test `SpanAssignment_NestedScope_IssueExample` that validates the fix with the exact scenario from the issue\n- All 1,560 collection expression tests pass\n\nFixes dotnet/roslyn#80683\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Fix the SafeContext of Span-valued collection expressions to match specification</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>See also dotnet/roslyn#80107\n> See also dotnet/csharplang#9750\n> \n> Currently the below program is valid.

Possibly, it always has the same value.\n\nIn my opinion, `escapeFrom` is a confusing name for this parameter, as it implies that the *safe-context* of `BoundExpression expr` is already known. But, usually that *safe-context* is actually determined by calling a helper like `GetParameterValEscape(...)` and passing in `expr`, as the BoundKind of `expr` is switched on/narrowed down.\n\nInstead, it seems like `escapeFrom` is used when the expression is thought to hold a reference to the current block.\n\nIt seems like things would be more clear if `escapeFrom` were either renamed to `localScopeDepth` a la `GetValEscape()`, or, if the parameter were deleted and `_localScopeDepth` were used instead.\n\nNote that theoretically it seems like we could implement our ref safety checks by patterns like `GetValEscape(source).IsConvertibleTo(GetValEscape(dest))`. The reason we have `CheckValEscape` methods is, that when the conversion of the source safe-context fails, we can give an error which is appropriate for the particular expression.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/80682","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Parameter `escapeFrom` in `CheckValEscape()`/`CheckRefEscape()` is confusing\" (#80682)"},{"Id":"3511552057","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-13T21:37:36","Actor":"Copilot","Number":"80681","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix IsSymbolAccessibleWithin to respect EmbeddedAttribute","State":"open","Body":"## Fix IsSymbolAccessibleWithin to respect EmbeddedAttribute\n\nThis PR fixes the issue where `Compilation.IsSymbolAccessibleWithin` doesn't check for `EmbeddedAttribute` and incorrectly returns `true` for symbols marked with this attribute when they're in a different assembly.\n\n### Plan:\n- [x] Explore repository and understand the issue\n- [x] Build the project successfully\n- [x] Add EmbeddedAttribute check to C# AccessCheck.IsNamedTypeAccessible\n- [x] Add EmbeddedAttribute check to VB AccessCheck\n- [x] Create test cases for C# compiler\n- [x] Create test cases for VB compiler\n- [x] Fix infinite recursion issue in attribute checking\n- [x] Run tests and verify the fix\n- [x] Ensure all tests pass\n- [x] Address code review feedback\n\n### Key Changes:\nThe fix adds a check in `IsNamedTypeAccessible` (for both C# and VB) to return `false` when:\n1.

When enabled, typing `///` (or `'''` in VB) generates the summary tag in a compact single-line format instead of spanning multiple lines.\n\n2. **\"Generate only <summary> tag\"** - When enabled, only generates the `<summary>` tag and omits other tags like `<param>`, `<typeparam>`, `<returns>`, and `<exception>`.\n\n## Behavior Examples\n\n**Default behavior (both options disabled):**\n```csharp\n/// <summary>\n/// |\n/// </summary>\n/// <param name=\"x\"></param>\n/// <param name=\"y\"></param>\nvoid M(int x, string y) { }\n```\n\n**With \"Generate <summary> on single line\" enabled:**\n```csharp\n/// <summary>|</summary>\n/// <param name=\"x\"></param>\n/// <param name=\"y\"></param>\nvoid M(int x, string y) { }\n```\n\n**With both options enabled:**\n```csharp\n/// <summary>|</summary>\nvoid M(int x, string y) { }\n```\n\n**Pressing Enter inside single-line summary:**\nWhen the user presses Enter between `<summary>` and `</summary>`, it expands to the multi-line format:\n```csharp\n/// <summary>\n/// |\n/// </summary>\n```\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **66% reduction in lines** for single-line summary comments\n- **Further reduction** when combined with only-summary option for simple properties and methods\n- **Consistency** with other single-line XML elements like `<param>`, `<returns>`, etc.\n- **Flexibility** to easily expand to multi-line by pressing Enter\n- **Backward compatible**: Both options default to false, preserving existing behavior\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n- Added `GenerateSummaryTagOnSingleLine` and `GenerateOnlySummaryTag` boolean options to `DocumentationCommentOptions` with XML doc comments\n- Updated both C# and VB documentation comment snippet services to respect both options\n- Added UI checkboxes in Advanced Options for both languages\n- Resource strings consolidated in shared `ServicesVSResources.resx`\n- Added automation object properties (`GenerateSummaryTagOnSingleLine` and `GenerateOnlySummaryTag`) for programmatic access\n- Included comprehensive unit tests for both C# and VB with proper WorkItem attributes\n- Whitespace is automatically trimmed in single-line mode for cleaner output\n- Fixed caret positioning logic to correctly account for the \"///\" being shaved off before snippet insertion\n\nFixes #10968\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Style: Decrease number of lines for default <summary> element in XML comments</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>**Version Used**: Visual Studio 2015\n> \n> **Steps to Reproduce**:\n> 1.

For example:\n\n```csharp\n// User selects this code:\nConsole.WriteLine(\"test\");\n\n// Uses Ctrl+K, Ctrl+S to surround with #if snippet\n// Result (notice trailing space after the code):\n#if DEBUG\nConsole.WriteLine(\"test\") \n#endif\n```\n\nThe trailing space after `\"test\")` is the unwanted whitespace from the snippet template.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe `CleanUpEndLocation` method in `SnippetExpansionClient.cs` handles cleanup after snippet expansion by:\n1. Removing the temporary empty comment marker inserted at the `$end$` position\n2. Cleaning up whitespace around that position\n\nHowever, it only removed whitespace when an **entire line** was whitespace. It didn't handle the common case where there's actual content followed by trailing whitespace before the `$end$` marker (from the `$selected$ $end$` pattern in snippet templates).\n\n## Solution\n\nExtended `CleanUpEndLocation` to detect and remove trailing whitespace before the `$end$` marker when the line contains actual content:\n\n1. **Scans backward** from the `$end$` position to find any trailing whitespace\n2. **Removes whitespace** only when there's non-whitespace content before it (preserves leading indentation)\n3. **Maintains compatibility** with existing behavior for whitespace-only lines\n\n## Implementation\n\n```csharp\n// Scan backwards from the $end$ position to find trailing whitespace\nvar startOfTrailingWhitespace = endPositionInLine;\nwhile (startOfTrailingWhitespace > 0 && char.IsWhiteSpace(lineText[startOfTrailingWhitespace - 1]))\n{\n    startOfTrailingWhitespace--;\n}\n\n// Only remove if we found trailing whitespace AND there's content before it\nvar hasTrailingWhitespace = startOfTrailingWhitespace < endPositionInLine;\nvar hasContentBeforeWhitespace = startOfTrailingWhitespace > 0;\n\nif (hasTrailingWhitespace && hasContentBeforeWhitespace)\n{\n    // Remove the trailing whitespace\n    SubjectBuffer.Delete(new Span(trailingWhitespaceStart, trailingWhitespaceLength));\n}\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nThe fix correctly handles all edge cases:\n- ✅ Text with trailing space before `$end$`: removes the trailing space\n- ✅ Text with no space before `$end$`: no change\n- ✅ Line with only indentation: handled by existing code path\n- ✅ Indented text with trailing space: removes only trailing space, preserves indentation\n\nThis is a minimal, surgical change that addresses the specific issue without affecting other snippet functionality.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>The default #if code snippet always insert white space end of $selected$</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/The-default-if-code-snippet-always-inse/10793883)._\n> \n> ---\n> The default #if code snippet always insert white space end of $selected$.

Checking if the cursor is inside a `ParenthesizedExpressionSyntax`\n2. Verifying the expression inside the parentheses resolves to a type symbol\n3. Returning the appropriate `NameDeclarationInfo` for name generation\n\nThe implementation follows the same pattern as existing tuple handling methods and is placed appropriately in the check chain.\n\n## Testing\n\nAdded ten test cases covering:\n- Generic types: `(List<Person> $$` → suggests \"people\"\n- Predefined types: `(int $$` → suggests \"i\"\n- Qualified names: `(System.Action $$` → suggests \"action\"\n- Fully qualified generic types: `(System.Collections.Generic.List<Person> $$` → suggests \"people\"\n- Array types: `(Person[] $$` → suggests \"people\"\n- Variants with closing paren present for all of the above\n\nAll builds successful with no regressions expected.\n\nFixes dotnet/roslyn#75347\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Suggest name when naming tuple element</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>### Version Used\r\n> \r\n> Compiler: 4.12.0-3.24470.4 (d799b056)  \r\n> .NET: 9.0.100-rc.1.24452.12  \r\n> Visual Studio Code: 1.93.1, `38c31bc77e0dd6ae88a4e9cc93428cc27a56ba40`, x64  \r\n> C# Extension: v2.49.25  \r\n> C# Dev Kit Extension: v1.11.11\r\n> \r\n> ### Background and Motivation\r\n> \r\n> Many symbols today get suggested names depending on the context, like method parameters.

When `HasInitializer` returned `false`, the dataflow analysis incorrectly determined the variable was not definitely assigned on entry to the local function (since local functions can be called before assignment).\n\n### Solution\nUpdated `HasInitializer` to walk up the syntax tree from `SingleVariableDesignationSyntax` nodes and detect:\n- **Out var declarations**: `Goo(out var v)` - ArgumentSyntax with out keyword\n- **Deconstruction assignments**: `var (b, c) = (0, 0)` - AssignmentExpressionSyntax\n- **Foreach declarations**: `foreach (var (x, y) in ...)` - ForEachStatementSyntax/ForEachVariableStatementSyntax\n\nThis allows the service to skip expensive dataflow analysis and correctly identify these variables as definitely assigned from initialization.\n\n### Changes Made\n- [x] Updated `HasInitializer` in `CSharpReassignedVariableService.cs` (35 lines changed)\n- [x] Added comprehensive test cases:\n  - `TestDeconstructionReassignedInLocalFunction` - Main issue scenario\n  - `TestDeconstructionReassignedInLocalFunction_MixedWithRegular` - Mixed variables\n  - `TestDeconstructionReassignedInLocalFunction_ExplicitType` - Explicit type deconstruction\n  - `TestDeconstructionReassignedInLocalFunction_Nested` - Nested deconstruction\n  - `TestOutVarReassignedInLocalFunction` - Out var scenario\n  - `TestPatternMatchingReassignedInLocalFunction` - Pattern matching edge case\n- [x] Verified code formatting follows project conventions\n- [x] Built successfully with no warnings or errors\n- [x] Minimal, surgical changes that preserve existing behavior\n\n### Testing\nAll existing tests continue to pass (build successful).

This returns delegate declarations as-is without modification, consistent with how nested type declarations are handled.\n\nThis approach is appropriate because:\n- Delegates are valid members of C# interfaces\n- Delegate declarations in interfaces don't need transformation (unlike methods which need bodies removed, fields which are converted to properties, etc.)\n- This follows the same pattern as nested type declarations which are also returned as-is\n\n## Changes Made\n\n1. **CSharpSyntaxGenerator.cs**: Updated the type check to include `DelegateDeclarationSyntax` using pattern matching\n2. **SyntaxEditorTests.cs**: Added test `TestInsertDelegateIntoInterface` with WorkItem attribute to verify delegates can be added to interfaces\n3. **copilot-instructions.md**: Added guidance about including WorkItem attributes for tests that fix GitHub issues\n\n## Testing\n\n- ✅ New test `TestInsertDelegateIntoInterface` passes\n- ✅ All existing SyntaxEditorTests (10 tests) pass\n- ✅ No new test failures introduced\n- ✅ Verified issue exists in v4.8.0 and is fixed in this PR\n\n## Example\n\nAfter this fix, the following code works correctly:\n\n```csharp\nvar syntaxEditor = new SyntaxEditor(root, workspace);\nvar delegateDecl = SyntaxFactory.DelegateDeclaration(/* ... */);\nsyntaxEditor.InsertMembers(interfaceDecl, 0, new[] { delegateDecl });\nvar newRoot = syntaxEditor.GetChangedRoot(); // No exception!\n```\n\nProducing:\n```csharp\npublic interface ITest\n{\n    delegate void MyDelegate();\n    void Method();\n}\n```\n\nFixes dotnet/roslyn#78860\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Exception is thrown in SyntaxEditor when adding a delegate declaration to an interface declaration</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>**Version Used**: \n> \n> 4.12.0\n> \n> **Steps to Reproduce**:\n> \n> The following code results in an exception being thrown if `parent` is an interface declaration and `newMember` is a delegate declaration:\n> ```\n> var syntaxEditor = new SyntaxEditor(orgSyntaxRoot, workspace);\n> syntaxEditor.AddMember(parent, newMember);\n> var newSyntaxRoot = syntaxEditor.GetChangedRoot();

This ensures that \"Remove unnecessary usings/imports\" consistently appears before \"Add file header\" in the code fix dropdown, matching user expectations.\n\nThe fix follows the existing pattern already used by `RemoveUnnecessaryImportsCodeFixProvider` for ordering relative to other code fix providers (e.g., `AddMissingReference`, `ConvertToProgramMain`).\n\n## Changes\n\n- Added `[ExtensionOrder(Before = PredefinedCodeFixProviderNames.FileHeader)]` to `CSharpRemoveUnnecessaryImportsCodeFixProvider`\n- Added `<ExtensionOrder(Before:=PredefinedCodeFixProviderNames.FileHeader)>` to `VisualBasicRemoveUnnecessaryImportsCodeFixProvider`\n\nThis is a minimal, surgical fix (2 lines added) that uses established MEF patterns to control code fix provider ordering without changing any functionality.\n\nFixes #ISSUE_NUMBER\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>\"Add File Header\" codefix priority too high</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>**Version Used**: \n> VS 2026 Insiders 11109.219\n> **Steps to Reproduce**:\n> \n> 1. create a new class\n> 2. go to first line where (now obsolete) using statements live\n> 3. hit ctrl-. to get the dropdown for the codefixes to remove the unnecessary using statements\n> 4. observe that \"Add File Header\" is the first entry of the dropdown now, and preselected, and thus your muscle memory fails and instead of removing  lines a bunch of comments are added when you hit return\n> 5. be sad\n> \n> **Expected Behavior**:\n> \"Add file header\" should have lower priority, at least below any warning or hint, and thus be not-the-first in the context menu\n> **Actual Behavior**:\n> for whatever reason, it went first:\n> <img width=\"801\" height=\"290\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfa3be20-dbb3-429e-959a-3b259caf8777\" /></issue_description>\n> \n> <agent_instructions>Look at CSharpRemoveUnnecessaryImportsCodeFixProvider and see how it already orders itself before and after other code fix providers.

Two blocking calls using `JoinableTaskFactory.Run()` were identified:\n\n1. **`OnOpenDocument`**: Blocks UI thread during initial file refresh\n2. **`OnDocumentOpenedIntoWindowFrame`**: Blocks UI thread during window frame setup\n\nBlocking the UI thread allows reentrancy as `JoinableTaskFactory` pumps messages while waiting. During this reentrancy, several race conditions could occur:\n- Window frames might be associated with the wrong documents\n- Text buffer operations could be applied out of order\n- The `_updatingBuffer` flag could be checked at the wrong time\n- Window frame properties could be set on the wrong window\n\nAny of these could result in other editor windows (like Program.cs) having their text buffers incorrectly affected, causing keyboard input to be \"eaten.\"\n\n## Solution\n\nChanged both methods to use `JoinableTaskFactory.RunAsync()` instead of `Run()`:\n\n**In `OnOpenDocument`:**\n```csharp\n// Don't block the UI thread during initial file refresh to avoid potential reentrancy issues.\n_ = _threadingContext.JoinableTaskFactory.RunAsync(async () => await openFile.RefreshFileAsync(CancellationToken.None));\n```\n\n**In `OnDocumentOpenedIntoWindowFrame`:**\n```csharp\n// Don't block the UI thread to avoid potential reentrancy issues during window frame setup.\n// Blocking here could allow other events to be processed, potentially causing the window frame\n// to be associated with the wrong document.\n_ = _threadingContext.JoinableTaskFactory.RunAsync(() => openFile.SetWindowFrameAsync(windowFrame));\n```\n\nThis fire-and-forget pattern prevents UI thread blocking and eliminates the reentrancy windows where race conditions could occur.\n\n## Behavior\n\nThe fix ensures that file initialization and window frame setup happen asynchronously without blocking the UI thread, preventing race conditions during source-generated file management. Users can now click \"Rerun generator\" and immediately continue working in other files without keyboard input being blocked.\n\nFixes #74032\n\nCo-authored-by: @CyrusNajmabadi\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Clicking 'rerun generator' prevent future edits into the regular text buffer.</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>Roslyn recently switched to using \"balanced\" for source generators, which means it only runs source generators on save/build.

For example, in the following cases an allocation can be avoided:\n\n```cs\nvar dictionary = new Dictionary<string, string>();\nvar key = \"...\";\nvar keySpan = key.AsSpan();\n\ndictionary[key.Substring(1)] = value;\ndictionary[key.Remove(1)] = value;\ndictionary[key[..2]] = value;\ndictionary[keySpan.ToString()] = value;\n```\n\nThe analyzer could recommend to avoid allocation by creating a `ReadOnlySpan<char>` instead and using `GetAlternateLookup<ReadOnlySpan<char>>` method exposed by various dictionary types as well as `HashSet<K, V>`:\n\n```cs\nvar alternate = dictionary.GetAlternateLookup<ReadOnlySpan<char>>();\nalternate[key.AsSpan(1)];\n```\n\nIn case if `ToLower{Invariant}` or `ToUpper{Invariant}` is called on a key to perform a lookup, it might even be easier to pass `StringComparer` to dictionary constructor:\n\n```cs\nvar dictionary = new Dictionary<string, string>(StringComparer.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase);\n```\n\n**Analysis**\n\nThe analyzer can look for the following calls on `Dictionary<string, V>`, `ConcurrentDictionary<string, V>`, `FrozenDictionary<string, V>` and `HashSet<string>`:\n\n- Indexer access.\n- `TryGetValue`, `ContainsKey`, `TryAdd` calls.\n\nThen it can look for the following calls in an expression used as a key for a lookup:\n\n- `Substring`, `Remove`, `Replace`, `Trim`, `TrimStart`, `TrimEnd`, `ToLower{Invariant}, `ToUpper{Invariant}`\n- Range expression\n- `ToString` call on a `{ReadOnly}Span<char>`\n\nIf an expression is a variable, it may also analyze the expression assigned to that variable. It may also analyze parts of a simple expression like conditional or coalesce operation.\n\n> While analyzing assignments to a variable, the analyzer should probably make sure that the variable is not used anywhere except lookup. For example, if the variable is passed to some API that takes a `string`, the analyzer cannot recommend using `Span` instead of a `string`.\n\n**Examples**\n\nI prototyped such an analyzer and ran it as a standalone analysis tool against projects in dotnet/runtime repo.

It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.17  Runtime or .NET 8.0.314 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.6  Runtime or .NET 9.0.107 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

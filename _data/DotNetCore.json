These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across the .NET framework. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

I talked to the CloudBuild team and they directed me to reach out to the Roslyn compiler team.

Previously, if `Verbosity` isn't specified, it will be null. And `null != true`, so the message is printed.\n\nAfter the change, `MSBuildArgs.Verbosity` is actually never null. `MSBuildArgs` is set via `SetupSilentBuildArgs` which clones the args with `VerbosityOptions.quiet` if `Verbosity` was null.\n\n\nSo, before the change:\n\n- `dotnet run` -> prints the message\n- `dotnet run -v:q` -> doesn't print the message\n\nAfter the change, it's not printed in both the above cases, and only gets printed if a verbosity other than quiet is explicitly provided.\n\n@baronfel "},{"Id":"53069424045","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-08-07T11:31:49","Actor":"nohwnd","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/13431","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"dotnet test error MSB4181: The \"Microsoft.TestPlatform.Build.Tasks.VSTestTask\" task returned false but did not log an error\" (#13431) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"When running NUnit tests using `dotnet test` I sometimes get the following error at the end of the test run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.401\\Microsoft.TestPlatform.targets(32,5): error MSB4181: The \"Microsoft.TestPlatform.Build.Tasks.VSTestTask\" task returned false but did not log an error.

The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

Furthermore, I confirmed that it is only where I am comparing a nullable type using that function and I am guessing that I missed a thread someone opened on this issue. I am aware .NET core 2.2 is not LTS. I also thought this goes here because it's not AFAIK, an EF core issue but rather an Ienumerable/Linq issue.\r\n\r\nUpdate: As it turns out your notion of `DateTime.Now` getting evaluated twice is true. To rectify that, I will now be using `DateTime.Now.Date`. This is odd because this exact code works on 4.6.1. You're probably right. SMH. Thank you @GrabYourPitchforks!

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

failed","State":"open","Body":"(not sure if there is a more appropriate internal support queue, please let me know if there is)\n\n**Version Used**: \nMSBuild 17.4\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\n\nWe had a PR get in that enabled a Roslyn analyzer rule, but subsequently all runs started failing because there was a latent warning that was not flagged. The repro does not happen locally (I checked out the commit enabling the rule), it happened in CloudBuild. I talked to the CloudBuild team and they directed me to reach out to the Roslyn compiler team. Per David from CB team, the calls to csc are identical.\n\nThis is specifically about CA1868.\n\n**Expected Behavior**:\nBuild failed\n\n**Actual Behavior**:\nBuild succeeded\n\nI added two binlogs here where one run failed and one succeeded:

The method `<>E__0.<Extension>$` is no-op. The method `<>E__0.That` is always throwing. Only `AssertExtensions.That` is meaningful and that's the only thing called from the entry-point (the callsite of the extension).\n\nIs there anything I'm missing?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/79823","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Compiler generates seemingly unused class for extensions?\" (#79823)"},{"Id":"3297982086","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-07T04:56:59","Actor":"anonntojalil-eng","Number":"79815","RawContent":null,"Title":"Off","State":"closed","Body":"### Type of issue\n\nTypo\n\n### Description\n\nTgh\n\n### Page URL\n\nRgg\n\n### Content source URL\n\nFhh","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/79815","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Off\" (#79815)"},{"Id":"3298633072","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-07T03:16:09","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"79822","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Source code updates from dotnet/dotnet","State":"closed","Body":"\n> [!NOTE]\n> This is a codeflow update.

Please describe.\nI have projects that conditionally include some files based on the build configuration. As a simplified example, suppose my .csproj file contains:\n\n```\n  <ItemGroup Condition=\"'$(Configuration)' != 'Test'\">\n    <Compile Remove=\"**\\*Test.cs\" />\n    <Compile Remove=\"**\\*Tests.cs\" />\n    <Compile Remove=\"**\\*TestHelper.cs\" />\n    <Compile Remove=\"**\\TestHelpers\\**\\*.cs\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\n```\n\nWhen I run dotnet format the files matching those patterns are not affected. In particular I do not see unused \"using\" expressions removed for the *Test.cs files while I will see unused using expressions removed for files not matching the patterns.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\nI am not sure what is possible, but it seems like supporting a --configuration argument should be possible. I would hope to be able to specify the configuration like I would with dotnet build or dotnet test:\n\n> dotnet format --configuration Test\n\nThis should cause the project to be built and formatted using the specified build configuration.\n\n### Additional context\n\nI have further problems with JetBrains rider (I haven't tried visual studio) where after I run dotnet format I cannot build or even rebuild from the IDE. I have to do a \"dotnet build --configuration Test\" to be able to build from the IDE again. I don't know how Visual Studio behaves. I suspect it has something to do with everyone sharing bin and obj directories. Maybe JetBrains Rider could play nicer with the obj and bin directories if that is the case, I can only speculate.

In the CCA runtime environment it has .NET 8 installed by default at `/usr/lib/dotnet`\n2. I actually need to use .NET 9\n3. So in the build steps I'm using the following:\n\n```yml\n      - name: Setup .NET\n        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4\n        with:\n          dotnet-version: 9.0.x\n```\n\n4. That adds a new .NET installation at `/home/runner/.dotnet`\n\nNow, if you try to do `dotnet tool install <some-dotnet-9-tool>`,  it will fail because it only sees the .NET 8 SDK. Even if you set the env var `DOTNET_ROOT` to `/home/runner/.dotnet`, this still fails - it seems to ignore `DOTNET_ROOT` entirely. The only thing that worked for me is running `/home/runner/.dotnet/dotnet tool install <some-dotnet-9-tool>`. So it seems it *does* care about the path to the `dotnet` installation you're calling.\n\nBut then if you try to run your tool with `dotnet <some-dotnet-9-tool>`, it will fail because it only sees the .NET 8 SDK. Even if you run `/home/runner/.dotnet/dotnet <some-dotnet-9-tool>` it fails - it seems to ignore the path to the `dotnet` installation you're calling entirely. The only thing that worked for me is setting `DOTNET_ROOT` to `/home/runner/.dotnet`.\n\nHopefully you can see how these two paragraphs are inconsistent with each other. Ideally:\n\n * Min bar: both installation and invocation should respect `DOTNET_ROOT`\n * Better still: also, if `DOTNET_ROOT` is not set, then they should both respect the path to the installation that you ran\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/50110","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"\"dotnet tool install\" and \"dotnet <toolname>\" inconsistent treatment of paths and DOTNET_ROOT\" (#50110)"},{"Id":"3299814517","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-07T09:53:43","Actor":"Copilot","Number":"50109","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add architecture validation for dotnet test with UseAppHost=false in MTP","State":"open","Body":"This PR implements architecture validation for Microsoft Testing Platform (MTP) projects when `UseAppHost=false` is used with the `--arch` parameter.\n\n## Problem\n\nWhen `UseAppHost=false`, .NET projects don't generate an executable host and instead rely on `dotnet exec mydll.dll` for execution. In this scenario, if a user specifies `--arch` with an architecture that doesn't match the current .NET host architecture, the execution would fail with unclear errors or unexpected behavior.\n\nThe issue specifically requested:\n1. Adding a test for `UseAppHost=false` with `--arch` parameter for MTP\n2. Supporting this case with proper error handling for architecture mismatches\n3. Ensuring behavior matches `dotnet run --arch` requirements\n\n## Solution\n\n### Architecture Validation Logic\n- **Detection**: Automatically detects when `UseAppHost=false` by checking if `RunArguments` starts with \"exec\"\n- **Architecture Parsing**: Extracts requested architecture from both MSBuild args (`-p:RuntimeIdentifier=`) and command line (`--arch` parameter)\n- **Validation**: Compares requested architecture with current muxer architecture using proper normalization\n- **Error Handling**: Provides clear, actionable error message when architectures don't match\n\n### Implementation Details\n- Added validation in `TestApplication.CreateProcessStartInfo()` before process execution\n- Implemented comprehensive architecture parsing that handles various architecture name variants (x64/amd64, arm64/aarch64)\n- Added helper methods for architecture detection and normalization\n- Integrated validation only for MTP scenarios with `UseAppHost=false`\n\n### Error Message\nWhen an architecture mismatch occurs, users now see:\n```\nThe current .NET host does not support the requested target architecture 'wrongArchitecture'. \nThe current host is running 'x64' architecture. \nWhen UseAppHost is false, the target architecture must match the current .NET host architecture.\n```\n\n### Testing\n- Added test case `RunMTPProjectWithUseAppHostFalseAndArchMismatch_ShouldFailWithProperError`\n- Created test asset combining MTP with `UseAppHost=false` configuration\n- Updated test to use existing working assets to avoid network dependencies\n\nThis ensures consistent behavior with `dotnet run --arch` and provides clear guidance about the architectural constraint when using `UseAppHost=false` with MTP projects.\n\nFixes #49718.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

See that issue for discussion.\n\n.NET binaries and installers have moved to a new domain -- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` -- backed by a new Content Delivery Network (CDN). You may need to make changes to adjust.\n\nTracking issue: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9674\n\n> .NET Team Status:\n> - azureedge.net scream tests are starting\n> - See: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9676\n\n>  \n> Recommended action:\n> - Read [Critical: .NET Install links are changing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/critical-dotnet-install-links-are-changing/) for an overview.\n> - Update `azureedge.net` references\n> - Update local copies of install script\n> - Update pinned references to [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n> - Validate that firewall rules are resilient to using new domains.\n> \n> Last update: 2025.01.23\n> Next update: 2025.02.04\n\n## Context\n\nSome .NET binaries and installers have been hosted on Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) domains that end in `.azureedge.net`. These domains were hosted by [edg.io](https://edg.io/), which has [ceased operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/edgio-retirement-faq) due to bankruptcy. We [migrated to a new CDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/migrate-cdn-to-front-door) and will be using new domains going forward. \n\nWe expect`azureedge.net` domains to cease by 5/31 (at latest).\n\n## .NET Team Remediation\n\nNew domains were created:\n\n- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` for signed official builds\n- `ci.dot.net` for unsigned builds\n\nTest links for new CDN:\n\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nTest links for old CDN:\n\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nThe following resources have been updated to use new domains.\n\n- [`releases-index.json`](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json)\n- [.NET install script](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/)\n- [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n- [CI short links](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/pull/15365)\n\nOther changes are in progress.\n\n## User Remediation\n\nPlease make the following replacements:\n\n- `dotnetcli.azureedge.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n- `dotnetbuilds.blob.core.windows.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n\nAll the new domains are path-compatible with old domains, as they share the same origin.\n\nPlease also make the following changes:\n\n- Update local copies of the install script\n- Update setup-dotnet Action references\n- Validate that firewall rules work with the new domains\n\n## Install script\n\nThe [.NET install script](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script) is used to install .NET from our CDN. We are changing CDNs (documented in a following section), which requires us to change the install script to use the new CDN.\n\nUpdated scripts:\n\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh`\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.ps1`\n\nNotes: \n\n- Users who have local copies of these scripts will need to update their copies.\n- Users who rely on the remote copy (at the URLs above) do not need to do anything other than validate no observed change in behavior (due to new domains and CDNs being used).\n\nTracking PRs:\n\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #554](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/554)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #555](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/555)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts/issues #558](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/issues/558)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #564](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/564)\n- [dotnet/docs #44052](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/44052)\n\n## Official builds\n\nOfficial builds and JSON files are hosted via a CDN, available for use by the install script and other installers.\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net\n\nNotes:\n\n- Official builds are tested and signed by Microsoft. A `microsoft.com` domain was chosen to reflect that.\n- We also [plan to stop using dowload.visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9675) for new content. That CDN will continue to function.\n- [Microsoft.Deployment.DotNet.Releases](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Deployment.DotNet.Releases) has been [updated](https://github.com/dotnet/deployment-tools/pull/423)\n\nYou can change from old to new domains by changing the domain section of the URL. The other parts of the URL do not need to change.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nA set of short links are available for official builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/dotnet-sdk-win-x64.zip\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-x64.tar.gz\n \nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- Currently forward to:  https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net.\n- Will be changed to forward to: https://build.dotnet.microsoft.com.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in mid January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/core #9683](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9683)\n\n## CI builds\n\nContinuous integration (CI) builds are hosted via a CDN, available via the install script and GitHub README files.\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net\n\nNote: CI builds include a mix of tested and untested builds, signed and unsigned builds.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n\nA set of short links are available for CI builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/daily/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/dotnet-runtime-win-x64.exe\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-arm.tar.gz\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/10.0.1xx/daily/dotnet-sdk-osx-arm64.pkg\n\nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- New builds now forward to: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old builds forward to:  https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in mid January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/core #9683](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9683)\n\nCI build pages use the CI short links.\n\nExample build pages:\n\n- [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/project/dogfooding.md#daily-builds-table)\n- [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/README.md#nightly-builds)\n- [dotnet/sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/documentation/package-table.md)\n\n## Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions\n\n- Major versions tags for [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570) have been updated. References to pinned versions will require updating to the most recent version.\n- We expect that GitHub Enterprise Server will be addressed in January.\n- Azure DevOps [`UseDotnetTask`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/use-dotnet-v2?view=azure-pipelines) will be updated in January\n- We do not yet have a date for updating [Azure DevOps Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/server/).\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/336","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Critical: .NET install domains and URLs are changing\" (#336)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-08-08T03:30:16.4423836Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":6688}

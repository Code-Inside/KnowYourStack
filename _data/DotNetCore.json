name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty. Details of the Microsoft .NET Bounty Program including terms and conditions are at <https://aka.ms/corebounty>.\n\n### Support\n\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET GitHub organization.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

Furthermore, I confirmed that it is only where I am comparing a nullable type using that function and I am guessing that I missed a thread someone opened on this issue. I am aware .NET core 2.2 is not LTS. I also thought this goes here because it's not AFAIK, an EF core issue but rather an Ienumerable/Linq issue.\r\n\r\nUpdate: As it turns out your notion of `DateTime.Now` getting evaluated twice is true. To rectify that, I will now be using `DateTime.Now.Date`. This is odd because this exact code works on 4.6.1. You're probably right. SMH. Thank you @GrabYourPitchforks!

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

This creates unsafe code that can lead to resource leaks if an exception occurs during initialization.\r\n\r\nFor example, given this code:\r\n```csharp\r\nusing var form = new MultipartFormDataContent();\r\nform.Add(new StringContent(request.Id.ToString()), \"id\");\r\nform.Add(new StringContent(request.Name), \"name\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe analyzer would suggest converting it to:\r\n```csharp\r\nusing var form = new MultipartFormDataContent\r\n{\r\n    { new StringContent(request.Id.ToString()), \"id\" },\r\n    { new StringContent(request.Name), \"name\" }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is unsafe because using declarations are lowered such that initialization happens **before** entering the try-finally block. If initialization throws an exception, the object is never assigned to the variable, so `Dispose()` is never called:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// Lowered code for using declaration with collection initializer\r\nvar __temp = new MultipartFormDataContent();\r\n__temp.Add(...);  // ‚Üê If this throws, __temp is never assigned to 'form'\r\n__temp.Add(...);  //   so Dispose() won't be called!\r\nvar form = __temp;\r\ntry { }\r\nfinally { if (form != null) ((IDisposable)form).Dispose(); }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nAdded the same safety check that IDE0017 (object initializers) already has to prevent suggestions for using declarations:\r\n\r\n1. Added abstract `IsValidContainingStatement` method to `AbstractUseCollectionInitializerDiagnosticAnalyzer`\r\n2. Implemented in C# to block using declarations (checks for `LocalDeclarationStatementSyntax` with `UsingKeyword`)\r\n3. Implemented in VB to return true (VB doesn't have using declarations like C#)\r\n\r\nThe fix is minimal and follows the existing pattern from IDE0017, ensuring consistency across analyzers.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nAdded `TestDoNotOfferForUsingDeclaration` test that verifies the analyzer doesn't suggest collection initializers for using declarations with IDisposable types.

This prevents the paths from being interpreted as switches while still referring to the exact same file (both `/Program.cs` and `/./Program.cs` have the same inode on Unix).\n\nThe transformation is applied in `ManagedCompiler.GetSourcesForCommandLine()`:\n- Only runs on Unix (detected via `Path.DirectorySeparatorChar`)\n- Transforms paths like `/Program.cs` ‚Üí `/./Program.cs`\n- Preserves all task item metadata using a lightweight wrapper class\n- Skips paths already starting with `/./` to avoid double-transformation\n\n## Compatibility\n\nThe fix maintains full compatibility with:\n- **CallerFilePath**: The compiler normalizes `/./path` to `/path` when resolving file paths\n- **SourceLink**: Uses a separate JSON file for path mapping, unaffected by source file arguments\n- **PathMap**: The compiler resolves paths before applying path mappings\n- **Debug info**: File paths are normalized during PDB generation\n\n## Testing\n\nAdded tests for both C# and VB compilers covering:\n- Single source file in root directory\n- Multiple source files with mixed paths (some in root, some in subdirectories)\n\nAll 377 existing MSBuild task tests continue to pass.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>`csc` misinterprets a source file in root directory on Unix as a command-line option switch</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>```sh\n> docker run --rm -it mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:10.0 bash\n> # inside the docker container:\n> dotnet new console\n> sed -i 's|</Project>|<ItemGroup><Compile Include=\"/Program.cs\" /></ItemGroup></Project>|' ConsoleApp1.csproj # the default globs don't work in root\n> dotnet build -bl\n> ```\n> \n> (I guess you could also create the project anywhere else, and just put the C# file to root folder and add the `<Compile Include=\"/Program.cs\" />`.)\n> \n> Observed:\n> \n> ```\n> CSC : error CS2007: Unrecognized option: '/Program.cs'\n> ```\n> \n> Motivating scenario: file-based apps: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/51282\n> \n> Proposed solution: change the Csc/Vbc tasks so they pass such files as `/./Program.cs` (this workaround is mentioned in https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/401).

This addresses a common footgun that frequently impacts users.\n\nFixes #<issue_number>\n\n## What was changed\n\n- **New warning NETSDK1234**: Added warning message to resource strings indicating when an application name ends with `.App` or `.Service` which may prevent it from running on macOS\n- **New targets file**: Created `Microsoft.NET.MacOSAppName.targets` with the check logic that runs during build\n- **Integration**: Imported the new targets file in `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.BeforeCommon.targets`\n- **Tests**: Added comprehensive test coverage with 7 test cases covering various scenarios\n\n## Warning behavior\n\nThe warning fires when:\n- `OutputType` is `Exe` (executable projects)\n- `RuntimeIdentifier` or `NETCoreSdkPortableRuntimeIdentifier` starts with `osx` or `macos`\n- `AssemblyName` ends with `.App` or `.Service`\n\nExample warning output:\n```\nwarning NETSDK1234: The application name 'MyTest.App' ends with '.App' which may prevent the application from running on macOS. Rename the application or set the AssemblyName property to a different value.\n```\n\n## Suppressing the warning\n\nDevelopers who intentionally want to use these naming conventions can suppress the warning in two ways:\n\n1. Set the `CheckMacOSAppName` property to `false`:\n   ```xml\n   <PropertyGroup>\n     <CheckMacOSAppName>false</CheckMacOSAppName>\n   </PropertyGroup>\n   ```\n\n2. Use the standard `NoWarn` property:\n   ```bash\n   dotnet build /p:NoWarn=NETSDK1234\n   ```\n\n## Testing\n\nAll tests pass including:\n- ‚úÖ Warning fires for `.App` suffix with macOS RID\n- ‚úÖ Warning fires for `.Service` suffix with macOS RID  \n- ‚úÖ No warning for normal app names\n- ‚úÖ No warning when targeting non-macOS platforms (e.g., Windows)\n- ‚úÖ Warning can be suppressed via property\n- ‚úÖ Warning can be suppressed via NoWarn\n- ‚úÖ No warning for library projects (OutputType=Library)\n\n## Related\n\nThis implements the solution described in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/120935\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>The SDK should issue a build warning when building a macOS app that likely won't run</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>### Is your feature request related to a problem?

However, this directory was not excluded from the app's default non-compile items. This is particularly problematic for apps using `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web`, which includes `**/*.json` files in its default items.\n\n**Reproduction:**\n```csharp\n// app.cs\n#:sdk Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\n#:property PublishAot=false\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\nvar app = builder.Build();\napp.MapGet(\"/\", () => \"Hello World!\");\napp.Run();\n```\n\n```bash\ndotnet publish app.cs          # Creates ./artifacts/app/ with JSON files\ndotnet publish app.cs          # JSON files from first publish get included, causing errors\n```\n\nThis resulted in:\n- Warnings about files being in use\n- Recursive artifact directories: `./artifacts/app/artifacts/app/*.json`\n- Publish failures when file locks couldn't be retried\n\n## Solution\n\nAdded `$(PublishDir)/**` to the `DefaultItemExcludes` property in `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.DefaultItems.targets`, conditioned on `PublishDir` being set. This follows the same pattern as existing exclusions for `BaseOutputPath` and `BaseIntermediateOutputPath`.\n\nThe exclusion is placed alongside other output path-related exclusions and only applies when `PublishDir` is defined, ensuring it doesn't affect projects where the property isn't set.\n\n## Testing\n\n- Added test `It_excludes_items_in_publish_directory` that verifies JSON files in `PublishDir` are not included in None items\n- All 21 existing tests in `GivenThereAreDefaultItems` pass\n- Manually verified with file-based Web SDK app - no recursive artifacts on second publish\n\nFixes #44721\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Output from publishing file-based app using web SDK is included by default items, causes errors on subsequent publish</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>The default output directory for publishing file-based apps, `./artifacts/<app name>`, next to the app file, is not excluded from the app's default non-compile items. This is especially problematic for app's using the `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web` SDK which includes **.json* files in its default items. This results in issues if you call publish multiple times without clearing the output directory, as the JSON files in the output directory get included in the next publish command.\n> \n> Repro steps:\n> \n> 1.

This can also be a container publish:\n>       `dotnet publish app.cs --os linux --arch x64 -t:PublishContainer`\n> 6. Observe the warnings about files being in use. If the publish succeeds (I've seen it fail, I've seen retries on the file in use succeed), note the publish output directory now contains \"recursive\" items, e.g. `./artifacts/app/artifacts/app/*.json`\n> \n> We might want to consider updating the default non-compile items globs for file-based apps to exclude the artifacts directory.</issue_description>\n> \n> <agent_instructions>Follow my instructions in the last comment here to solve this issue</agent_instructions>\n> \n> ## Comments on the Issue (you are @copilot in this section)\n> \n> <comments>\n> <comment_new><author>@DamianEdwards</author><body>\n> @willdean we specifically didn't want a *bin* but instead wanted to adopt a more modern layout similar to [artifacts output layout](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk/artifacts-output). *artifacts* is widely used in the developer ecosystem across different stacks as the output location for build, etc. and is already in common *.gitignore* files, etc.</body></comment_new>\n> <comment_new><author>@baronfel</author><body>\n> For file-based apps, the decision was made to explicitly allow the `publish` gesture to leave binaries next to the app in question - functionally speaking this means setting `PublishDir` to something like `./artifacts/<appName>` when publishing file-based apps.\n> \n> For other projects, PublishDir is generally set by default to a location under the `BaseOutputPath` or explicitly managed by a user (by the `-o`/`--output` flags on `dotnet publish`). In these cases the published assets generally aren't within the 'cone' of items globbed by default by the SDK.\n> \n> The SDK already tries to filter out these base output paths from the set of items that are globbed:\n> \n> https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/c2d964b8dac43353e9596203cc96c407a45af7f5/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/targets/Microsoft.NET.Sdk.DefaultItems.targets#L34-L37\n> \n> For these other projects, `PublishDir` is contained in these locations - but that's not actually an enforced thing. I think we can solve this problem for file-based apps, (as well as the general correctness problem in the SDK overall) by adding another entry here to exclude the `PublishDir/**` glob in a similar fashion - though we should condition this on the `PublishDir` actually existing.</body></comment_new>\n> </comments>\n> \n\n\n</details>\n\nFixes dotnet/sdk#51391\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n‚ú® Let Copilot coding agent [set things up for you](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/new?title=‚ú®+Set+up+Copilot+instructions&body=Configure%20instructions%20for%20this%20repository%20as%20documented%20in%20%5BBest%20practices%20for%20Copilot%20coding%20agent%20in%20your%20repository%5D%28https://gh.io/copilot-coding-agent-tips%29%2E%0A%0A%3COnboard%20this%20repo%3E&assignees=copilot) ‚Äî coding agent works faster and does higher quality work when set up for your repo.\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/51417","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Exclude PublishDir from default items to prevent recursive artifacts in file-based apps\" (#51417)"},{"Id":"3541950786","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-22T18:36:22","Actor":"nagilson","Number":"51416","RawContent":null,"Title":"`dnup` should use an atomic move operation if the dotnet_root folder is empty","State":"open","Body":"We want to avoid possible installation issues if the dnup process is killed/closed/system shuts down in the middle of install.

Once the SDK updates to include those APIs, the analyzer will automatically detect preview features in the new constructs.\n\n**Tests:**\nAdded comprehensive test cases for all scenarios.

These changes expand the program‚Äôs scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù or ‚Äúnot complete.‚Äù Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as ‚Äúcomplete.‚Äù Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe‚Äôve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

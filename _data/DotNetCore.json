It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"702426498","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-16T06:07:11","Actor":"billvenhaus","Number":"1774","RawContent":null,"Title":"[UWP] HttpClientHandler - Digest Authentication Broken on Windows 10 PC","State":"closed","Body":"Just recently I found that my UWP app can no longer connect with Digest authentication on Windows 10 PCs.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key.

And the changes are identical to those in the other backports.\r\n\r\n# Regression\r\n\r\nThis is not a regression.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43141","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/2.1] Fix ReadOnlySequence created out of sliced Memory owned by MemoryManager\" (#43141)"},{"Id":"1224389900","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-03T19:24:35","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43143","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.26","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43143","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.26\" (#43143)"},{"Id":"1202264239","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-13T04:53:34","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43142","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merging internal commits for release/3.1","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43142","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Merging internal commits for release/3.1\" (#43142)"},{"Id":"1193653850","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-05T21:51:59","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43140","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.25","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43140","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.25\" (#43140)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Roslyn-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"3660606694","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-25T02:15:40","Actor":"ToddGrun","Number":"81433","RawContent":null,"Title":"PublicApi txt file changes after resetting public api files for 18.0","State":"closed","Body":"Cherry-pick and merge of https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/commit/c3625e10fc99fc50a334e383422cf0b0b579d498","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/81433","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"PublicApi txt file changes after resetting public api files for 18.0\" (#81433)"},{"Id":"3661210901","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-25T02:02:38","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"81436","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:111cfc79-5f9f-4acd-d8a2-08dc0c5899fd)\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\n- **Subscription**: [111cfc79-5f9f-4acd-d8a2-08dc0c5899fd](https://maestro.dot.net/subscriptions?search=111cfc79-5f9f-4acd-d8a2-08dc0c5899fd)\n- **Build**: [20251124.6](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=2846727) ([292167](https://maestro.dot.net/channel/2/github:dotnet:arcade/build/292167))\n- **Date Produced**: November 24, 2025 10:01:45 PM UTC\n- **Commit**: [9a99542f9b72dbcd0e07baec5166909ab756788a](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/commit/9a99542f9b72dbcd0e07baec5166909ab756788a)\n- **Branch**: [main](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/tree/main)\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Dependency Updates**:\n  - From [11.0.0-beta.25571.8 to 11.0.0-beta.25574.6][1]\n     - Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk\n     - Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Sdk\n     - Microsoft.DotNet.XliffTasks\n\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/compare/a8b9e73f56...9a99542f9b\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\n\n\n[marker]: <> (End:111cfc79-5f9f-4acd-d8a2-08dc0c5899fd)\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/81436","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#81436)"},{"Id":"3653274187","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-25T00:46:42","Actor":"jhinder","Number":"81407","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix some minor UI errors that were caused by binding failures","State":"closed","Body":"This PR fixes two things which were caused by broken XAML bindings.\r\n\r\n1: The \"Include overload(s)\" option in the rename flyout was broken because the checkbox was not properly bound to the bool that controls this behaviour.\r\n\r\nLeft: old (\"1 reference\", right: fixed (\"2 references\").\r\n<img width=\"780\" height=\"322\" alt=\"grafik\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acf76bc4-3bc2-47b0-94d5-5e7176bcf4b4\" />\r\n\r\n2: The left checkbox in \"Pull Members Up\" is greyed out when the destination is an interface and the member is a field.

However, it would aid JIT with handling such methods if the generated throw helper was annotated with `[DoesNotReturn]`. Currently, it appears to be inlined, which subsequently reduces the likelihood of inlining methods with non-exhaustive switch expressions with missing default clause. \n\nI understand that this is ideally an issue for JIT to handle, but given the current policy of applying `[DoesNotReturn]` to other throw helpers too, this falls in line with the established practice.\n\nThe motivation for this issue is that we are using https://www.nuget.org/packages/StaticCS to great success in performance-sensitive scenarios, which results in switches that are effectively exhaustive for which Roslyn cannot legally elide the default clause (not until we get type unions 🙂).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/81412","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Suggestion] Emit `[DoesNotReturn]` on generated `ThrowSwitchExpressionException` for switch expressions Roslyn does not consider exhaustive\" (#81412)"},{"Id":"3653630992","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-22T03:39:03","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"81408","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:111cfc79-5f9f-4acd-d8a2-08dc0c5899fd)\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\n- **Subscription**: [111cfc79-5f9f-4acd-d8a2-08dc0c5899fd](https://maestro.dot.net/subscriptions?search=111cfc79-5f9f-4acd-d8a2-08dc0c5899fd)\n- **Build**: [20251121.7](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=2844564) ([291849](https://maestro.dot.net/channel/2/github:dotnet:arcade/build/291849))\n- **Date Produced**: November 21, 2025 4:48:54 PM UTC\n- **Commit**: [23d431613e20b20517334c1acbc7a04a6edb6ad9](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/commit/23d431613e20b20517334c1acbc7a04a6edb6ad9)\n- **Branch**: [main](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/tree/main)\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Dependency Updates**:\n  - From [11.0.0-beta.25570.6 to 11.0.0-beta.25571.7][1]\n     - Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk\n     - Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Sdk\n     - Microsoft.DotNet.XliffTasks\n\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/compare/c1926cf647...23d431613e\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\n\n- **Updates to .NET SDKs:**\n  - Updates **sdk.version** to 10.0.100-rc.2.25502.107\n  - Updates **tools.dotnet** to 10.0.100-rc.2.25502.107\n\n[marker]: <> (End:111cfc79-5f9f-4acd-d8a2-08dc0c5899fd)\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/81408","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#81408)"},{"Id":"3653764168","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-22T03:24:48","Actor":"RikkiGibson","Number":"81410","RawContent":null,"Title":"\"Failed to get language for textDocument/diagnostic\" when saving a new file","State":"open","Body":"Repro steps in VS Code:\n1) New Untitled Text File (ctrl+N).\n2) Change Language Mode to C#.

Please describe.\n\nWhile solutions are the traditional way to manage multi-project build and orchestration in the .NET ecosystem due to their IDE support, the [Traversal](https://github.com/microsoft/MSBuildSdks/tree/main/src/Traversal) MSBuild SDK is often used by large teams or power users that want more direct control of their repo-wide build experiences. These projects mimic many of the benefits of solutions, while allowing for a more natural way to express build-level dependencies, easier Target definitions, and more 'clean' alignment to traditional MSBuild semantics.\n\nToday, Traversal projects are treated like 'normal' projects by the .NET CLI for non-MSBuild commands. Commands like `test`, `format`, `reference add`, and more attempt to interact just with the Traversal project instead of 'unwrapping' the project to discover its contained project graph - like they do for solutions.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nThe `dotnet` CLI should natively support traversal projects in all of its commands and experiences. It should provide patterns for contributing teams to correctly consume and work with such projects. It should enable easily creating new traversal projects.\n\n### Additional context\n\nTraversal projects are often used by large teams inside Microsoft to make common repo-management tasks easier.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

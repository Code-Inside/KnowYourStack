These bugs are subtle.\r\n\r\nLuckily, we can avoid a pretty horrible join point by relying on the fact that the version numbers for all the shared frameworks (and internal non-shipping versions) align across the core runtime runtime repos for all the version numbers in question. Use the runtime versions instead of windowsdesktop, wpf, and winforms versions. To avoid accidental, I've eliminated these dependencies from Version.Details.xml, and set the original properties based on runtime properties that we know build every time."},{"Id":"51975879707","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-07-11T13:07:02","Actor":"springheeledjackDE","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/49744","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Microsoft.NET.RuntimeIdentifierInference.targets insist on win-AnyCPU on a MAUI/Win.UI project\" (#49744) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"****************************************************************************************\nI was having trouble getting the Doc FX framework to work with my Win.UI project. \nI have the following csproj file for a Win.UI project out of the MAUI template project.

What you're seeing tells us definitively:\n\nRuntimeIdentifier = win-AnyCPU is being set: This property is indeed getting this invalid value during the project evaluation.\n\nThe Culprit: The line C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\9.0.302\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.RuntimeIdentifierInference.targets (344,5) points directly to the source.\n\nThis is a core .NET SDK targets file, specifically designed for Runtime Identifier inference.\n\nLine 344 (and 345 for OutputPath) within this file is where the SDK is attempting to figure out the RuntimeIdentifier for your build when it's not explicitly provided.\n\nThe fact that it's inferring win-AnyCPU for a WinUI/MAUI project on Windows, even when your csproj lists valid win-x86, win-x64, win-arm64 RIDs and you've tried to set a default Platform, indicates a bug in the .NET SDK 9.0.302's inference logic. It's incorrectly combining the \"Windows\" platform with a general \"AnyCPU\" concept, which is not a valid Runtime Identifier.\"\n\n\"Report this bug to Microsoft: This behavior in dotnet SDK 9.0.302 is unexpected and should be reported. You can open an issue on the dotnet/sdk GitHub repository, providing the details you've uncovered (especially the binlog output showing Microsoft.NET.RuntimeIdentifierInference.targets (344,5) setting win-AnyCPU).\"\n\n************************************************************************\nIt seems your RuntimeIdentifierInference is overwriting RuntimeIdentifiers even when they are explicilty set.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nKevin\n\n******************************************************************************\ndotnet --info:\n\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.302\n Commit:

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

So I suspect the behavior comes from `ilasm`.\n\nI verified that `ildasm` returns the correct order: `.field public int32 modopt(int64) modopt(string) modopt(int32) 'field'`.\nI also tested this with `ilasm` from Desktop and verified reflection output from Core (.NET 10p5). It prints out the expected order (`System.Int64` is first when doing `Console.WriteLine(typeof(C).GetField(\"field\").GetOptionalCustomModifiers().First().ToString());`).\n\nIn short, `ilasm`, `ildasm` and reflection agree. Maybe the issue is in the metadata reader or the compiler expectations?\n\nThe second test below shows that in scenarios where we copy modifiers, the order is correct.\n\n```csharp\n    [Fact]\n    public void TODO2()\n    {\n        var ilSrc = \"\"\"\n.class public auto ansi beforefieldinit C\n    extends [mscorlib]System.Object\n{\n    .field public int32 modopt(int64) modopt(string) modopt(int32) 'field'\n\n    .method public hidebysig specialname rtspecialname instance void .ctor () cil managed \n    {\n        IL_0000: ldarg.0\n        IL_0001: call instance void [mscorlib]System.Object::.ctor()\n        IL_0006: nop\n        IL_0007: ret\n    }\n}\n\"\"\";\n        var comp = CreateCompilationWithIL(\"\", ilSrc, options: TestOptions.UnsafeDebugDll);\n        comp.VerifyEmitDiagnostics();\n\n        var field = comp.GetMember<NamedTypeSymbol>(\"C\").GetField(\"field\");\n        AssertEx.Equal([\"System.Int32\", \"System.String\", \"System.Int64\"], field.TypeWithAnnotations.CustomModifiers.SelectAsArray(m => m.Modifier.ToTestDisplayString()));\n    }\n```\n\n```csharp\n    [Fact]\n    public void TestWrite()\n    {\n        var ilSrc = \"\"\"\n.class public auto ansi beforefieldinit Base\n\textends [mscorlib]System.Object\n{\n\t.method public hidebysig newslot virtual instance void modopt(int64) modopt(string) modopt(int32) M () cil managed \n\t{\n\t\tIL_0000: nop\n\t\tIL_0001: ret\n\t}\n\n\t.method public hidebysig specialname rtspecialname instance void .ctor () cil managed \n\t{\n\t\tIL_0000: ldarg.0\n\t\tIL_0001: call instance void [mscorlib]System.Object::.ctor()\n\t\tIL_0006: nop\n\t\tIL_0007: ret\n\t}\n}\n\"\"\";\n        var src = \"\"\"\npublic class C : Base\n{ \n    public override void M() { }\n}\n\"\"\";\n        var comp = CreateCompilationWithIL(src, ilSrc);\n        comp.VerifyEmitDiagnostics();\n\n        // The IL below shows expected order of modifiers (ignore that the test actually fails when re-run, that's due to variable assembly name for compiled IL)\n        CompileAndVerify(comp).VerifyTypeIL(\"C\", \"\"\"\n.class public auto ansi beforefieldinit C\n    extends ['_0_a81477ba-f57b-4bad-bd87-8e9609b8d968']Base\n{\n    // Methods\n    .method public hidebysig virtual \n        instance void modopt([netstandard]System.Int64) modopt([netstandard]System.String) modopt([netstandard]System.Int32) M () cil managed \n    {\n        // Method begins at RVA 0x2067\n        // Code size 1 (0x1)\n        .maxstack 8\n        IL_0000: ret\n    } // end of method C::M\n    .method public hidebysig specialname rtspecialname \n        instance void .ctor () cil managed \n    {\n        // Method begins at RVA 0x2069\n        // Code size 7 (0x7)\n        .maxstack 8\n        IL_0000: ldarg.0\n        IL_0001: call instance void ['_0_a81477ba-f57b-4bad-bd87-8e9609b8d968']Base::.ctor()\n        IL_0006: ret\n    } // end of method C::.ctor\n} // end of class C\n\"\"\");\n    }\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/79344","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unexpected order of custom modifiers read from metadata\" (#79344)"},{"Id":"3223317291","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-11T21:19:58","Actor":"mattleibow","Number":"79338","RawContent":null,"Title":"CSharpUseNullPropagationCodeFixProvider for IDE0031 in SyntaxEditor fails with \"GetCurrentNode returned null\" on Windows and macOS but works on Linux","State":"closed","Body":"**Version Used**: \n\n.NET 9 and .NET 10 SDK using `dotnet format`.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\n\n1.

The existing `Combine` operator causes the downstream pipeline to re-evaluate whenever *either* side changes. While this behaviour is appropriate in general, it introduces inefficiencies in common generator workflows.\n\nAn optimal generator needs to:\n\n1. Determine as cheaply as possible list of \"inputs\" that determine whether generation should occur. This can often be done via syntax analysis only without semantic analysis.\n2. Later enrich those inputs with additional contextual data—often requiring semantic model access—to produce the final output.\n\nDue to the design of the current API, developers are forced to perform all semantic enrichment during the `transform` step of `CreateSyntaxProvider`, because that is the only stage where `SemanticModel` is available. Attempting `Combine` with `context.CompilationProvider`  will lead to complete loss of incremental generation since compilation changes on every keystroke. As such, all semantic computation (even that which is only relevant for final source rendering vs equivalency checks) needs to happen inside `transform` delegate. As such the object coming out of `CreateSyntaxProvider` must be \"cache friendly\". Critically, developers must avoid passing `ISymbol` instances through `IncrementalValuesProvider` pipelines. Doing so causes the previous `Compilation` to be rooted in the incremental cache, leading to expensive and unnecessary cache invalidations. `SyntaxNode` can be passed downstream safely *only* if either:\n\n- It is excluded from equality comparison logic, or\n- A custom `IEqualityComparer` is used to ignore its reference identity (which is not value-comparable by default).\n\nThis leads to developers having to either having to create bulky model objects that must preemptively capture all possibly needed semantic data—even for unchanged inputs—just to preserve cache correctness, or generating final source output right in template. Alternatively they must compute the final string output right inside `transform` method and use that as the cache key. In both instances they will need to query semantic model which may not be necessary for minimal set of data that forms cache key. This undermines the purpose of a multi-step pipeline and can result in redundant semantic analysis.\n\nThe proposed `Attach` API enables a safe and efficient pattern: combine key-driven model tied to actual \"incremental value change\" (such as those coming from `CreateSyntaxProvider`) with a context value (such as `Compilation` snapshot obtained from `context.CompilationProvider`), in a way that guarantees recomputation only when \"one side\" changes, not \"either\" like in `Combine`. This permits semantic enrichment to occur *after* determining that a generation is needed, minimizing both semantic model overhead and cache churn. Even in scenarios where semantic information may need to be resolved twice (first in transform and then in Attach), if we can avoid accessing semantic model entirely due to cache hits driven by pure syntax model, it is likely a worthy tradeoff.\n\n\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```diff\nnamespace Microsoft.CodeAnalysis;\n\npublic static class IncrementalValueProviderExtensions\n{\n+    public static IncrementalValueProvider<TResult> Attach<TLeft, TRight, TResult>(\n+        this IncrementalValuesProvider<TLeft> left,\n+        IncrementalValueProvider<TRight> right,\n+        Func<TLeft, TRight, TResult> transform)\n+        where TLeft : notnull;\n}\n```\n\nThis method behaves similarly to `Combine`, but only propagates changes downstream when the **left** input changes. The **right** input is available for enrichment or context purposes (e.g., compilation or semantic model) but does not trigger recomputation on its own.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n``` C#\nvar syntaxModels = context.SyntaxProvider\n    .CreateSyntaxProvider(\n        predicate: static (node, _) => node.IsPartialTypeDeclaration(),\n        transform: static (context, _) => new ReducedModel(context.Node))\n    .WithComparer(ReducedModelKeyComparer.Instance); // Node is carried, but not part of the comparison. \n\nvar renderingView = syntaxModels.Attach(context.CompilationProvider, static (generationModel, compilation) =>\n{\n    \n    // we only arrive here if we determined that \n    // Compilation is used to enrich the model, but doesn't trigger incremental change on its own\n    \n    var semanticModel = compilation.GetSemanticModel(generationModel.Node);\n    return RenderModel(generationModel, semanticModel); // this is our source \"view\" that can use our custom model, node in it and semantic model to generate rendered source string\n});\n\ncontext.RegisterSourceOutput(renderingView, static (ctx, data) =>\n{\n    var source = SourceRenderer.Render(data);\n    ctx.AddSource(data.FileNameHint, source);\n});\n```\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\nOverload to `Combine` that takes `propagateOnlyIfLeftChanged: bool` flag\n\n## Risks\n\n- Introducing a new propagation model might complicate mental models of the incremental pipeline, especially for less experienced users.\n- In some scenarios can lead to degradation of performance. This can happen when semantic model is resolved in `transform` and selection criteria for caching doesn't trigger often enough to be worth the creating SemanticModel twice (first in transform and later in pipeline). This can largely be mitigated through developer education to select optimal strategy.\n- No compatibility issues are expected, as this is a purely additive API.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/79322","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Introduce Attach operator for source generator pipeline triggering incremental output driven by only one source (instead of either like Combine)\" (#79322)"},{"Id":"3217207895","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-09T21:30:29","Actor":"dr1rrb","Number":"79320","RawContent":null,"Title":"HR fails when removing a property with an initializer from a partial class","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: net 9.0 / Microsoft.CodeAnalysis 4.14.0\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\n1.

What you're seeing tells us definitively:\n\nRuntimeIdentifier = win-AnyCPU is being set: This property is indeed getting this invalid value during the project evaluation.\n\nThe Culprit: The line C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\9.0.302\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.RuntimeIdentifierInference.targets (344,5) points directly to the source.\n\nThis is a core .NET SDK targets file, specifically designed for Runtime Identifier inference.\n\nLine 344 (and 345 for OutputPath) within this file is where the SDK is attempting to figure out the RuntimeIdentifier for your build when it's not explicitly provided.\n\nThe fact that it's inferring win-AnyCPU for a WinUI/MAUI project on Windows, even when your csproj lists valid win-x86, win-x64, win-arm64 RIDs and you've tried to set a default Platform, indicates a bug in the .NET SDK 9.0.302's inference logic. It's incorrectly combining the \"Windows\" platform with a general \"AnyCPU\" concept, which is not a valid Runtime Identifier.\"\n\n\"Report this bug to Microsoft: This behavior in dotnet SDK 9.0.302 is unexpected and should be reported. You can open an issue on the dotnet/sdk GitHub repository, providing the details you've uncovered (especially the binlog output showing Microsoft.NET.RuntimeIdentifierInference.targets (344,5) setting win-AnyCPU).\"\n\n************************************************************************\nIt seems your RuntimeIdentifierInference is overwriting RuntimeIdentifiers even when they are explicilty set.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nKevin\n\n******************************************************************************\ndotnet --info:\n\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.302\n Commit:

Please describe.\n\nThe .NET 10 SDK Resolver gained the ability to provide environment variables that MSBuild will now set as part of evaluation/execution. This is used in .NET 10 to set key SDK-facing env vars like DOTNET_HOST_PATH. However, some environments for older SDKs may have previously calculated DOTNET_HOST_PATH to be the _directory_ containing the `dotnet` binary - not the correct semantic, which is the full path to the `dotnet` binary.\n\nThe SDK Container CreateNewImage ToolTask for net472 is one such example here, but there are likely others.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nTo mitigate this, we could consider only setting the env variables when the SDK resolved from the SdkResolver is 10+.\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/49735","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consider setting DOTNET_HOST_PATH only for SDKs that are resolved to be >= 10.0\" (#49735)"},{"Id":"3220286881","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-10T18:31:35","Actor":"Youssef1313","Number":"49734","RawContent":null,"Title":"Cleanup dotnet test","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/49734","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Cleanup dotnet test\" (#49734)"},{"Id":"3220278721","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-10T18:28:38","Actor":"Youssef1313","Number":"49733","RawContent":null,"Title":"dotnet test for MTP: Verify and add test for console app that does \"nothing\"","State":"open","Body":"We need to test the behavior of an empty console app that does nothing, and doesn't even handshake with us.

The apphost executable is named `$(AssemblyName)$(_NativeExecutableExtension)` \n2. On Unix, `$(_NativeExecutableExtension)` is empty, so the file is just named after the assembly (e.g., \"cs\")\n3. Packages with localized resources create culture directories with the same names (e.g., \"cs/\")\n4. MSBuild fails when trying to copy the apphost file to a location that's already a directory\n\n**Example failure:**\n```\ndotnet new console -o cs\ncd cs\ndotnet add package Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp\ndotnet build\n```\n\nResults in:\n```\nerror MSB3024: Could not copy the file \"cs/obj/Debug/net10.0/apphost\" \nto the destination file \"bin/Debug/net10.0/cs\", because the destination is a folder instead of a file.\n```\n\n## Changes Made\n\n**Added NETSDK1229 Warning:**\n- New warning message in `Strings.resx` with clear description and solutions\n- Suggests renaming the application or restricting `SatelliteResourceLanguages` property\n\n**Implemented Detection Target:**\n- Added `_WarnForApphostCultureCollision` target in `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.targets`\n- Runs after `ResolvePackageAssets` to ensure `ResourceCopyLocalItems` are available\n- Only executes for executable projects with `UseAppHost=true`\n- Compares apphost filename with culture metadata from resource packages\n- Issues warning when collision is detected\n\n**Warning Message:**\n> NETSDK1229: The executable file name '{0}' may conflict with resource directories for culture '{1}'. Consider renaming the application or restricting the SatelliteResourceLanguages property to avoid this conflict.\n\nThis provides early detection of the collision issue with clear guidance on how to resolve it, improving the developer experience for this edge case.\n\nFixes #49731.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.17  Runtime or .NET 8.0.314 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.6  Runtime or .NET 9.0.107 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

See that issue for discussion.\n\n.NET binaries and installers have moved to a new domain -- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` -- backed by a new Content Delivery Network (CDN). You may need to make changes to adjust.\n\nTracking issue: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9674\n\n> .NET Team Status:\n> - azureedge.net scream tests are starting\n> - See: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9676\n\n>  \n> Recommended action:\n> - Read [Critical: .NET Install links are changing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/critical-dotnet-install-links-are-changing/) for an overview.\n> - Update `azureedge.net` references\n> - Update local copies of install script\n> - Update pinned references to [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n> - Validate that firewall rules are resilient to using new domains.\n> \n> Last update: 2025.01.23\n> Next update: 2025.02.04\n\n## Context\n\nSome .NET binaries and installers have been hosted on Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) domains that end in `.azureedge.net`. These domains were hosted by [edg.io](https://edg.io/), which has [ceased operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/edgio-retirement-faq) due to bankruptcy. We [migrated to a new CDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/migrate-cdn-to-front-door) and will be using new domains going forward. \n\nWe expect`azureedge.net` domains to cease by 5/31 (at latest).\n\n## .NET Team Remediation\n\nNew domains were created:\n\n- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` for signed official builds\n- `ci.dot.net` for unsigned builds\n\nTest links for new CDN:\n\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nTest links for old CDN:\n\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nThe following resources have been updated to use new domains.\n\n- [`releases-index.json`](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json)\n- [.NET install script](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/)\n- [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n- [CI short links](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/pull/15365)\n\nOther changes are in progress.\n\n## User Remediation\n\nPlease make the following replacements:\n\n- `dotnetcli.azureedge.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n- `dotnetbuilds.blob.core.windows.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n\nAll the new domains are path-compatible with old domains, as they share the same origin.\n\nPlease also make the following changes:\n\n- Update local copies of the install script\n- Update setup-dotnet Action references\n- Validate that firewall rules work with the new domains\n\n## Install script\n\nThe [.NET install script](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script) is used to install .NET from our CDN. We are changing CDNs (documented in a following section), which requires us to change the install script to use the new CDN.\n\nUpdated scripts:\n\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh`\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.ps1`\n\nNotes: \n\n- Users who have local copies of these scripts will need to update their copies.\n- Users who rely on the remote copy (at the URLs above) do not need to do anything other than validate no observed change in behavior (due to new domains and CDNs being used).\n\nTracking PRs:\n\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #554](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/554)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #555](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/555)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts/issues #558](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/issues/558)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #564](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/564)\n- [dotnet/docs #44052](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/44052)\n\n## Official builds\n\nOfficial builds and JSON files are hosted via a CDN, available for use by the install script and other installers.\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net\n\nNotes:\n\n- Official builds are tested and signed by Microsoft.

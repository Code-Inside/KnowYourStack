The former leads to long, cumbersome, namespace qualified names everywhere, and the latter results in a huge blizzard of using statements everywhere, and unwieldy long intellisense lists.  There are many cases where one using for one outer namespace will do, and using a single inner namespace name to qualify a type is conveniently terse enough.  VB has had this since version 1.0, and it was never a problem.  In the case of ambiguity, a fully qualified name would still be required.</p>\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Mila Zhou[MSFT] on 9/27/2020, 00:32 AM: \n\nThank you for taking the time to provide your suggestion.

The question here is only if the conversion should be done on the C# or C side?\r\n\r\nThe handle might be more tricky as pthread_t doesn't need to be a numeric type. \r\n\r\nTherefore my idea is to store the handle in the managed part a a intptr. For systems that uses a numeric type for pthread_t that is smaller than a pointer we can just use it direct. On other systems we need to allocate some memory to store a copy of pthread_t and the managed part will store a pointer to this memory. But we need to make sure the memory is freed when the managed thread object is collected. \r\n\r\nThe other option would be doing it in the same way as socket addresses are store. The managed part asks the native how much space is needed. It creates a byte array and every time a native call is made the array is pinned. While this is very straight forward it might be less efficent.

I'll add something at the end of this explaining it for additional context, but I do not believe it to be directly relevant to my potential MSBuild issue.\r\n\r\nProject A is a web project targeting netcoreapp3.1.\r\n\r\nProject B is a class library targeting netstandard2.1 and has a build dependency on Project A set up in the following way:\r\n```\r\n<ItemGroup>\r\n    <ProjectReference Include=\"..\\ProjectA\\ProjectA.csproj\">\r\n        <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>\r\n        <ReferenceOutputAssembly>false</ReferenceOutputAssembly\r\n        <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=netcoreapp3.1</SetTargetFramework>\r\n    </ProjectReference>\r\n</ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nProject C is a class library targeting netcoreapp3.1. It has direct dependencies on Project B **and** Project A, as Project B's dependency does implicitly not include Project A's build output.\r\n\r\n# Issue\r\n\r\nBuilding Project C will build Project A twice concurrently. This results in frequent file lock problems. Specifically the `SetTargetFramework` inclusion in Project B's dependency on Project A will cause Project B to build Project A at the same time Project C's dependency on Project A builds Project A.\r\n\r\nIf I target netcoreapp3.1 in Project B and remove the `SetTargetFramework` inclusion, Project A will only build once. However, targeting netstandard2.1 in Project B is my ultimate goal.\r\n\r\nProject B only needs Project A as a **build** dependency. Project C needs the build outputs from both Project A and Project B.\r\n\r\n# Context\r\n\r\nProject A is an ASP.NET Core MVC project with API Controllers. It uses NSwag for to generate an OpenAPI spec. I am also using `Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server` with `OpenApiGenerateDocumentsOnBuild` to output that spec on build.\r\n\r\nProject B is a class library using `Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Client` to generate a C# NSwag client from the OpenAPI spec defined in Project A. This is why Project B has a build dependency on Project A, to ensure a current spec has been generated. Targeting .netstandard2.1 is the goal with Project B as it is a simple class library client for Project A.\r\n\r\nProject C is a class library using XUnit2 to test Project A using a `TestServer` with the library generated in Project B. It requires the client generated in Project B as well as the `Startup` definition in Project A.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/13961","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`SetTargetFramework` can cause multiple concurrent builds of dependencies\" (#13961)"},{"Id":"713609540","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-02T15:42:07","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"13956","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from mono/linker","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:9ac01057-d33d-4509-c9e1-08d846b6e5b9)\r\n## From https://github.com/mono/linker\r\n- **Subscription**: 9ac01057-d33d-4509-c9e1-08d846b6e5b9\r\n- **Build**: 20201002.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: 10/2/2020 12:57 PM\r\n- **Commit**: b89cb90abdfdc4e1ccd0822b62d367fa35d30f00\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.ILLink.Tasks**: [from 6.0.0-alpha.1.20480.9 to 6.0.0-alpha.1.20502.1][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/mono/linker/compare/8da3666...b89cb90\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:9ac01057-d33d-4509-c9e1-08d846b6e5b9)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/13956","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from mono/linker\" (#13956)"},{"Id":"713707128","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-02T15:25:12","Actor":"SCLD-FJaramillo","Number":"13958","RawContent":null,"Title":"Project file with directory check runs properly from Visual Studio build, fails from CLI build","State":"open","Body":"I have the following property group in my csproj file that allows me to find signtool on our build machines:\r\n\r\n`\r\n<PropertyGroup>\r\n    <!-- Find Windows Kit path and then SignTool path for the post-build event -->\r\n    <WindowsKitsRoot>$([MSBuild]::GetRegistryValueFromView('HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows Kits\\Installed Roots', 'KitsRoot10', null, RegistryView.Registry32, RegistryView.Default))</WindowsKitsRoot>\r\n    <WindowsKitsRoot Condition=\"'$(WindowsKitsRoot)' == ''\">$([MSBuild]::GetRegistryValueFromView('HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows Kits\\Installed Roots', 'KitsRoot81', null, RegistryView.Registry32, RegistryView.Default))</WindowsKitsRoot>\r\n    <WindowsKitsRoot Condition=\"'$(WindowsKitsRoot)' == ''\">$([MSBuild]::GetRegistryValueFromView('HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows Kits\\Installed Roots', 'KitsRoot', null, RegistryView.Registry32, RegistryView.Default))</WindowsKitsRoot>\r\n    <SignToolPath Condition=\"'$(SignToolPath)' == '' And '$(Platform)' == 'AnyCPU' and Exists('$(WindowsKitsRoot)bin\\x64\\signtool.exe')\">$(WindowsKitsRoot)bin\\x64\\</SignToolPath>\r\n    <SignToolPath Condition=\"'$(SignToolPath)' == '' And Exists('$(WindowsKitsRoot)bin\\$(Platform)\\signtool.exe')\">$(WindowsKitsRoot)bin\\$(Platform)\\</SignToolPath>\r\n    <SignToolPathBin Condition=\"'$(SignToolPath)' == ''\">$([System.IO.Directory]::GetDirectories('$(WindowsKitsRoot)bin',\"10.0.*\"))</SignToolPathBin>\r\n    <SignToolPathLen Condition=\"'$(SignToolPathBin)' != ''\">$(SignToolPathBin.Split(';').Length)</SignToolPathLen>\r\n    <SignToolPathIndex Condition=\"'$(SignToolPathLen)' != ''\">$([MSBuild]::Add(-1, $(SignToolPathLen)))</SignToolPathIndex>\r\n    <SignToolPathBase Condition=\"'$(SignToolPathIndex)' != ''\">$(SignToolPathBin.Split(';').GetValue($(SignToolPathIndex)))\\</SignToolPathBase>\r\n    <SignToolPath Condition=\"'$(SignToolPath)' == '' And '$(SignToolPathBase)' != '' And '$(Platform)' == 'AnyCPU'\">$(SignToolPathBase)x64\\</SignToolPath>\r\n    <SignToolPath Condition=\"'$(SignToolPath)' == '' And '$(SignToolPathBase)' != ''\">$(SignToolPathBase)$(Platform)\\</SignToolPath>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n`\r\n\r\nWhen I build and/or publish from VS, this snippet works without issue.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA security feature bypass vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft ASP.NET Core parses encoded cookie names.\r\n\r\nThe ASP.NET Core cookie parser decodes entire cookie strings which could allow a malicious attacker to set a second cookie with the name being percent encoded.\r\n\r\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by fixing the way the ASP.NET Core cookie parser handles encoded names.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/25701\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\n* Any .NET Core 3.1 application running on .NET Core 3.1.7 or lower\r\n* Any .NET Core 2.1 application running on .NET Core 2.1.21 or lower\r\n\r\nPlease note that .NET Core 3.0 is now out of support and all applications should be updated to 3.1.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software) you are exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET Core 3.1. If you have installed one or more .NET Core SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio which will also update your .NET Core SDKs.\r\n\r\nYou can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.1.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* You should download and install Runtime 3.1.8 or SDK 3.1.108 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.4) or 3.1.402 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.5 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files.

The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

It seems that built-in operators are designed as highest priority than all operators defined by users.\n\n```c#\nusing System;\n\nint i = 123;\nint j = 0;\nif (i || j)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Either '{nameof(i)}' or '{nameof(j)}' is non-zero.\");\n}\n\n\npublic static class Extensions\n{\n    extension(int)\n    {\n        public static bool operator true(int value) => value != 0;\n        public static bool operator false(int value) => value == 0;\n        public static int operator &(int left, int right) => left & right;\n        public static int operator |(int left, int right) => left | right;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n[link](https://lab.razor.fyi/#jY_NSsNAEICRiuicxCcYi7QJaPDnGOJFehEPBQ-CJ7dhkk7Y7pTdjahN3kbwFXwGH0R8Ae-SRKWClM5p5puZbxj47AGMreRWzaLU7b33Sscmx-tH52kWA7DxyJjgyelZ3BYFJngcA2cYMFYVFiEsABHxQowTTdGNZU9XbCg46I_YT8nicGHUjCQLOKyHKEugaAA7NGKOnshK1A9jqAFgXk40p-i88pxiqpVzOHrwZByLcd8n6QcEbHzYoq7RxF_DRESjzMkqLxa9LanZwXulSwoxOe8y3G-fW0eRKe3-dyQrHM38r2LQrmvK_GHbsJxPfStqGA46sJaqWq2qllU11HC5RdaKdbc722_Prx8v2e7m3cYX)\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/80257","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Cannot apply user-defined conditional logical operators on built-in types\" (#80257)"},{"Id":"3409623908","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-12T15:16:40","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"80252","RawContent":null,"Title":"Further cleanup of the code action api (8)","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/80252","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Further cleanup of the code action api (8)\" (#80252)"},{"Id":"3410880130","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-12T15:12:08","Actor":"AlekseyTs","Number":"80256","RawContent":null,"Title":"Do not make assumptions about content of erroneous BoundCall node based on value of InvokedAsExtensionMethod property","State":"open","Body":"Related to #78433.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/80256","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Do not make assumptions about content of erroneous BoundCall node based on value of InvokedAsExtensionMethod property\" (#80256)"},{"Id":"3410804489","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-12T14:50:00","Actor":"jjonescz","Number":"80255","RawContent":null,"Title":"Assert fails in `NullableWalker.AsMemberOfType`","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: [20250912.15](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng-public/public/_build/results?buildId=1146403) (d92fd99781edc6c81b65e4da0806dbeb12030acf, [main](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/tree/main)), Debug.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\n\n[.NET Lab](https://lab.razor.fyi/#46rk4gooyk8vSszVSy4Wyi4tzsxLVwiuLC5JzbXm4krOSSwuVnDmquZSUFBQSMrPz1Hw1QhKTUzxz8upDC5IzLPJzCuxU0jUUUBwkjTBiiFaQKAotaS0KE8hScHWViHRGixcy1XLJcSSm5iZZ8DoxZZaVJRfVBzFyXGjd-mz5WkCLAmMAA)\n\n```cs\nusing System;\n\nclass C\n{\n    bool M(ReadOnlySpan<int> a, Span<int> b)\n    {\n        return b == a;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis assert fails:\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/d92fd99781edc6c81b65e4da0806dbeb12030acf/src/Compilers/CSharp/Portable/FlowAnalysis/NullableWalker.cs#L8840\n\n```\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: Assertion failed\n   at System.Diagnostics.Debug.Fail(String message, String detailMessage)\n   at System.Diagnostics.Debug.Assert(Boolean condition)\n   at Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.NullableWalker.AsMemberOfType(TypeSymbol type, Symbol symbol)\n   at Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.NullableWalker.ReInferBinaryOperator(SyntaxNode syntax, MethodSymbol method, BoundExpression leftOperand, BoundExpression rightOperand, TypeWithState leftUnderlyingType, TypeWithState rightUnderlyingType)\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/80255","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Assert fails in `NullableWalker.AsMemberOfType`\" (#80255)"},{"Id":"3409687719","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-12T12:17:14","Actor":"SurfaceCobra","Number":"80253","RawContent":null,"Title":"The behavior of an extension member block with two generic arguments is inconsistent.","State":"closed","Body":"**Version Used**: .NET 10.0.0-rc.1.25451.107\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**: \n\n1.

We're especially interested in tracking the usage of file-based apps vs class project-based apps as that feature rolls out broadly for the first time.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\nWe need \n* a new telemetry event, \"dotnet/cli/run\"\n* data points about the run operation itself\n  * is this a file-based app run or a project-based app run?\n  * were launch profiles requested?\n    * if so, was the requested profile one of the 'default' ones?\n    * if not explicitly requested, was the default one used?\n*  data points about the project being run\n  * an obfuscated unique project identifier\n    * for file-based apps this is a computed value that is likely already in use for the caching infrastructure\n    * for project-based apps this should be the hashed path to the project inside the repo root\n  * count of SDKs used\n    * for file-based apps this would be the Sdk directive\n    * for project-based apps this would be the `Sdk=` element on a Project or Import node\n  * count of PackageReferences used\n    * for file-based apps this would be the count of package directives\n    * for project-based apps this would be the count of PackageReferences in the evaluation\n  * count of direct ProjectReferences\n    * for file-based apps this would be the count of project directives\n    * for project-based apps this would be the count of ProjectReferences in the evaluation\n  * count of requested additional properties for the run\n    * for file-based apps this is the count of property directives\n    * for project based apps this has no meaning\n  * for file-based apps additionally we want\n    * if this run used MSBuild directly\n    * if this run invoked the Roslyn compiler\n\nWhen adding this new event we need to make sure to fire the same event name for both kinds of applications. We should have a shared method that sends the event that both pathways can call into to ensure regularity, but each separate path should be able to add data unique to that path.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/50792","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Gather feature-level telemetry about `dotnet run`\" (#50792)"},{"Id":"3411837944","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-12T20:19:22","Actor":"Copilot","Number":"50791","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix RunReadyToRunCompiler to use ItemSpec instead of ToString for assembly references","State":"open","Body":"The `RunReadyToRunCompiler` task was using `ToString()` instead of `ItemSpec` when building command line arguments for assembly references. This caused ReadyToRun compilation to fail when NuGet package paths contained special characters like `@`.\n\nThe issue occurs because:\n- `ToString()` returns escaped paths (e.g., `/home/user/.nuget/p%40ckages/...`)\n- `ItemSpec` returns unescaped paths (e.g., `/home/user/.nuget/p@ckages/...`)\n\nThe ReadyToRun compiler tools (crossgen/crossgen2) expect unescaped file paths to correctly locate assembly references.\n\n**Example failure scenario:**\n```xml\n<configuration>\n  <config>\n    <add key=\"globalPackagesFolder\" value=\"/home/user/.nuget/p@ckages\" />\n  </config>\n</configuration>\n```\n\nRunning `dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-x64 -p:PublishReadyToRun=true` would fail with:\n```\nerror : Failed to load assembly 'SomeAssembly'\n```\n\n**Fix:**\nChanged two lines in `GetAssemblyReferencesCommands()` method to use `reference.ItemSpec` instead of `reference` (which implicitly calls `ToString()`):\n\n```diff\n- result.AppendLine($\"-r:\\\"{reference}\\\"\");\n+ result.AppendLine($\"-r:\\\"{reference.ItemSpec}\\\"\");\n\n- result.AppendLine($\"-r \\\"{reference}\\\"\");\n+ result.AppendLine($\"-r \\\"{reference.ItemSpec}\\\"\");\n```\n\nThis ensures that assembly reference paths are passed unescaped to the ReadyToRun compiler, allowing it to correctly locate assemblies even when paths contain special characters.\n\nFixes #50790.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

i < args.Length; i++)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Arg[{i}] = [{args[i]}]\");\n    }\n}\nelse\n{\n    while (Console.ReadLine() is string line && line.Length > 0)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(line);\n    }\n}\n```\nSteps:\n```powershell\nPS> dotnet --version\n10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107\n\nPS> dotnet run .\\test.cs -- this is command line\nparameter count = 0\nreadline\nreadline\n```\nExpected (works in 10.0.100-preview.7.25380.108):\n```powershell\nparameter count = 4\nArg[0] = [this]\nArg[1] = [is]\nArg[2] = [command]\nArg[3] = [line]\n```\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n- First run on 10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107 passed arguments correctly.\n- After that, the same command no longer passed arguments.\n- I cannot reproduce the initial successful behavior again.\n\n### Further technical details\n<details><summary>details of dotnet --info</summary>\n<p>\n\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107\n Commit:            2db1f5ee2b\n Workload version:  10.0.100-manifests.0e2d47c4\n MSBuild version:   17.15.0-preview-25451-107+2db1f5ee2\n\n런타임 환경:\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.19045\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107\\\n\n설치된 .NET 워크로드:\n표시할 설치된 워크로드가 없습니다.\nConfigured to use workload sets when installing new manifests.\n워크로드 집합이 설치되어 있지 않습니다. \"dotnet workload restore\"를 실행하여 워크로드 집합을 설치하세요.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      10.0.0-rc.1.25451.107\n  Architecture: x64\n  Commit:       2db1f5ee2b\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  6.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n  8.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n  8.0.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n  10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.27 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.16 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 10.0.0-rc.1.25451.107 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.27 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.16 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 10.0.0-rc.1.25451.107 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.11 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.27 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 7.0.16 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.2 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 10.0.0-rc.1.25451.107 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x86   [C:\\Program Files (x86)\\dotnet]\n    registered at [HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\dotnet\\Setup\\InstalledVersions\\x86\\InstallLocation]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n\n</p>\n</details>\n\n- OS: Windows 10 Pro 22H2 (19045.6332)\n- IDE: VS Code 1.103.2 \n- Shell: PowerShell 5.1.19041.6328\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/50778","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Regression: dotnet run <file>.cs -- args no longer passes command line arguments in 10.0.100-rc.1.25451.107\" (#50778)"},{"Id":"3409159239","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-12T07:01:44","Actor":"bwiklund","Number":"50776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Previously working dotnet watch test command stopped working on .NET 9","State":"open","Body":"we have a solution with a project that tests another project using NUnit.\n\nscript: (using bash on windows)\n`dotnet watch --project Tests/Tests.csproj test`\n\nused to work on <= .net 8.

You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.17  Runtime or .NET 8.0.314 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.6  Runtime or .NET 9.0.107 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.3  Runtime or .NET 9.0.103 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty. Details of the Microsoft .NET Bounty Program including terms and conditions are at <https://aka.ms/corebounty>.\n\n### Support\n\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET GitHub organization.

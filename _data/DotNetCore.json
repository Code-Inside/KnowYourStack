<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

Your report may be eligible for our [bug bounty](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core) but ONLY if it is reported through email.\nFor other types of questions, consider using [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com).\n\n-->\n\n### Describe the bug\nI experimented with the new extension feature and found a possible bug. When I am in extension block like this `extension(string s) { … }` and inside I create a method like this `public void Print([CallerArgumentExpression(\"s\")] string caller = \"\") { … }` the argument caller is not set to the argument expression. Like if I call `\"FooBar\".Print()`, the value is not \"\\\"FooBar\\\"\".\n\n### To Reproduce\n<!--\nWe ❤ code! Point us to a minimalistic repro project hosted in a GitHub repo, Gist snippet, or other means to see the isolated behavior.\n\nWe may close this issue if:\n- the repro project you share with us is complex. We can't investigate custom projects, so don't point us to such, please.\n- if we will not be able to repro the behavior you're reporting\n-->\nInstall dotnet sdk preview 10.0.100-preview.3.25201.16.\n\ncompile the following Code, into a ConsoleApp:\n\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Runtime.CompilerServices;\n\n\"FooBar\".Print();\n\"FooBar\".Print2();\n\nstatic class Ext \n{\n    public static Print2(this string s, [CallerArgumentExpression(\"s\") string caller = \"\") => \n        Console.Out.WriteLine(caller + \" = \" + s);\n    extension(string s) \n    {\n        public void Print([CallerArgumentExpression(\"s\")]string caller = \"\") =>\n            Console.Out.WriteLine(caller + \" = \" + s);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf you run it, the output will be:\n```\n = FooBar\n\"FooBar\" = FooBar\n```\n\nBut the method `Print` and `Print2` are just different notations for the same thing (syntactic sugar), so should produce the same output.\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n<!-- \nInclude the exception you get when facing this issue\n-->\nNo exceptions.\n\n### Further technical details\n<u>`dotnet --info`:</u>\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           10.0.100-preview.3.25201.16\n Commit:            9dee3cf508\n Workload version:  10.0.100-manifests.ef4f854f\n MSBuild version:   17.14.0-preview-25177-05+903614e16\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.19045\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\10.0.100-preview.3.25201.16\\\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use workload sets when installing new manifests.\nWorkloads are configured to install and update using workload versions, but none were found.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty. Details of the Microsoft .NET Bounty Program including terms and conditions are at <https://aka.ms/corebounty>.\n\n### Support\n\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET GitHub organization.

See that issue for discussion.\n\n.NET binaries and installers have moved to a new domain -- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` -- backed by a new Content Delivery Network (CDN). You may need to make changes to adjust.\n\nTracking issue: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9674\n\n> .NET Team Status:\n> - azureedge.net scream tests are starting\n> - See: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9676\n\n>  \n> Recommended action:\n> - Read [Critical: .NET Install links are changing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/critical-dotnet-install-links-are-changing/) for an overview.\n> - Update `azureedge.net` references\n> - Update local copies of install script\n> - Update pinned references to [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n> - Validate that firewall rules are resilient to using new domains.\n> \n> Last update: 2025.01.23\n> Next update: 2025.02.04\n\n## Context\n\nSome .NET binaries and installers have been hosted on Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) domains that end in `.azureedge.net`. These domains were hosted by [edg.io](https://edg.io/), which has [ceased operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/edgio-retirement-faq) due to bankruptcy. We [migrated to a new CDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/migrate-cdn-to-front-door) and will be using new domains going forward. \n\nWe expect`azureedge.net` domains to cease by 5/31 (at latest).\n\n## .NET Team Remediation\n\nNew domains were created:\n\n- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` for signed official builds\n- `ci.dot.net` for unsigned builds\n\nTest links for new CDN:\n\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nTest links for old CDN:\n\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nThe following resources have been updated to use new domains.\n\n- [`releases-index.json`](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json)\n- [.NET install script](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/)\n- [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n- [CI short links](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/pull/15365)\n\nOther changes are in progress.\n\n## User Remediation\n\nPlease make the following replacements:\n\n- `dotnetcli.azureedge.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n- `dotnetbuilds.blob.core.windows.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n\nAll the new domains are path-compatible with old domains, as they share the same origin.\n\nPlease also make the following changes:\n\n- Update local copies of the install script\n- Update setup-dotnet Action references\n- Validate that firewall rules work with the new domains\n\n## Install script\n\nThe [.NET install script](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script) is used to install .NET from our CDN. We are changing CDNs (documented in a following section), which requires us to change the install script to use the new CDN.\n\nUpdated scripts:\n\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh`\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.ps1`\n\nNotes: \n\n- Users who have local copies of these scripts will need to update their copies.\n- Users who rely on the remote copy (at the URLs above) do not need to do anything other than validate no observed change in behavior (due to new domains and CDNs being used).\n\nTracking PRs:\n\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #554](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/554)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #555](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/555)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts/issues #558](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/issues/558)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #564](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/564)\n- [dotnet/docs #44052](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/44052)\n\n## Official builds\n\nOfficial builds and JSON files are hosted via a CDN, available for use by the install script and other installers.\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net\n\nNotes:\n\n- Official builds are tested and signed by Microsoft.

See that issue for discussion.\n\nWe'll be reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3 and encourage ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to update to it. In this post I'll provide more background.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> This post only applies if you're using ASP.NET Core **on .NET Framework**. If you're using ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Core 2.x, it is [already out of support][netcore-support], and you should upgrade to a supported version such as .NET 8.\n\n### Background\n\nEarly versions of ASP.NET Core were provided for .NET Framework and .NET Core. Since 2021, [ASP.NET Core 2.1 is supported][aspnet21-support] only when running on .NET Framework. ASP.NET Core 2.2 has been out of support on all platforms since 2019.\n\nThis happened before we had a [predictable schedule and alternate releases of Standard Term Support (STS) and Long Term Support (LTS)][core-release-policies]. Many users upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2, not realizing that this reduced their support duration.\n\nAs a result, we now have users that are running on the unsupported version of ASP.NET Core 2.2 on .NET Framework.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support        |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | [Supported][aspnet21-support] |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019       |\n\n### How to stay supported\n\n* If you're on .NET Core, you should upgrade to .NET 8 and use ASP.NET Core 8\n* If you're on .NET Framework, you can either migrate to .NET 8 or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.3, which is the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1 (see below)\n\nSince ASP.NET Core 2.x for .NET Framework is just a set of packages, downgrading isn't that easy; there are well over one hundred packages and not all of them have 2.x version numbers. To make matters worse, there are NuGet packages out there that also upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2. Downgrading to ASP.NET Core 2.1 would mean that NuGet fails to restore these dependencies with errors.\n\nIn order to make this easier, we'll reship ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, thus facilitating this downgrade as a package upgrade.\n\nYou might wonder why we don't reship ASP.NET Core 2.2 as 2.3 instead. The answer is breaking changes. ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago, while ASP.NET Core 2.1 kept being supported. We feel it would be wrong to force ASP.NET Core 2.1 users to accommodate those breaking changes in order to stay supported.\n\nUsers on ASP.NET Core 2.2 are unsupported and won't receive any security updates. Our priority is to help those users to get onto a supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework.\n\nBy reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, we provide users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 an off ramp to the supported version via a regular NuGet upgrade. Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 will also be pulled forward to 2.3, but since it's the same code as 2.1, there are no breaking changes. Moving forward, all updates to ASP.NET Core 2.1 will be published as 2.3. However, if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.1, you don't need to move to 2.3 in order to get updates. If we find security issues with 2.1 packages, those will be marked as vulnerable and the recommended version will be versioned as 2.3. Except for the version number changes, that's how ASP.NET Core 2.1 works today, so there are no changes for you and you don't need to preemptively update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 to receive those warnings.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n>\n> Please note that if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.2, you will *not* be getting vulnerability warnings via NuGet because the product is out of support. There is no change here, this has been the case since ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago. Therefore, if you're on ASP.NET Core 2.2, we strongly recommend to update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 as soon as possible in order to receive security fixes again.\n\nWe understand that this can be confusing, but we believe it's the best compromise to help ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to get back onto a supported train.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support                          |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | Supported with ASP.NET Core 2.3                 |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019                         |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.3 | [Supported, same code as 2.1][aspnet21-support] |\n\n### Summary\n\nFor .NET Core, ASP.NET Core 2.x is and remains unsupported.\n\nThe following statements are specific for ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Framework:\n\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.1 is and remains supported**.\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.2 is and remains unsupported**.\n* **We're re-versioning ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3** to allow ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to move to a supported version.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 should update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. Since it's the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1, there are no breaking changes or feature additions. This operation won't require any code changes on your side. But it will make your life easier as all future updates will be versioned as 2.3.x, so you'll have a consistent set of versions.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. This will ensure you get off of the unsupported version and thus will get security fixes. You should expect breaking changes as you're effectively downgrading to the code from ASP.NET Core 2.1. If you can't live without the features being added in ASP.NET Core 2.2, you'll have to migrate to a supported .NET version with those features, such as .NET 8.\n* **This does not extend or reduce the support durations of any products, nor which versions of .NET are supported where**. It's purely a re-versioning of ASP.NET Core 2.1 in order to help the math in the package manager. The net effect of this change is that the last supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework is also the highest minor version (2.3).\n\n[aspnet21-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/aspnet/2.1-packages\n[netcore-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core\n[core-release-policies]: https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-policies.md\n\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/58598.

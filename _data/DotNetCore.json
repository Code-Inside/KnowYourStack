The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"702426498","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-16T06:07:11","Actor":"billvenhaus","Number":"1774","RawContent":null,"Title":"[UWP] HttpClientHandler - Digest Authentication Broken on Windows 10 PC","State":"closed","Body":"Just recently I found that my UWP app can no longer connect with Digest authentication on Windows 10 PCs.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption.

But the code that is being generated is different when using `dotnet build` or `Visual Studio 2022` to build the project. The source generator is targeting `netstandard20` so this means that the `Color` class should not contain the static `RebeccaPurple` property. But for some reason the source generator thinks this colors exists when building with `dotnet build` and it does the correct thing when building with `Visual Studio 2022`. I would expect them to have the same compiled output.\n\n### Reproduction Steps\n\nThe issue can be reproduced with the code of this project: https://github.com/dlemstra/source-generator-bug.

Please describe.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Android projects build 4 architectures by default:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<TargetFramework>net9.0-android<TargetFramework>\r\n<!-- these are implicit if you leave them blank -->\r\n<RuntimeIdentifiers>android-arm;android-arm64;android-x86;android-x64</RuntimeIdentifiers>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have custom MSBuild logic that \"combines\" the 4 architectures and emits a final Android package at the end. To make this work, we run an `<MSBuild />` task per-RID that runs a subset of the `dotnet publish` MSBuild targets for trimming, Mono AOT compilation, etc.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the .NET SDK had built-in support for this, as it could be useful for several scenarios:\r\n\r\n* Android (as mentioned)\r\n* macOS or MacCatalyst, has similar logic as Android. Mac apps on the App Store should target x64 and arm64 currently.\r\n* I have a console app, I want to publish it with NativeAOT, single file, targeting N platforms.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\n\r\nOne solution, would be to make a new `TargetFramework` syntax, such as:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<TargetFrameworks>net9.0-android/android-arm;net9.0-android/android-arm64;net9.0-android/android-x86;net9.0-android/android-x64</TargetFrameworks>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe .NET SDK would handle running inner/outer builds with the `<MSBuild/>` task.\r\n\r\n#### PROs\r\n\r\nThis would enable the Android & macOS/MacCatalyst workloads to rely on logic in the .NET SDK instead of inventing our own.\r\n\r\nThis also would be useful, in that new `#if` directives could exist like:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n#if ARM || ARM64\r\n    // Do some \"arm\"-y stuff\r\n#elif X86 || X64\r\n    // Do some macOS Intel or Android emu/Chromebook/WSL stuff\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\nThis would be useful on both macOS and Android.\r\n\r\n#### CONs\r\n\r\n* We now run the C# compiler N times. Build performance concerns?\r\n\r\n* MAUI projects will have a combinatorial explosion of `$(TargetFrameworks)`.\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\nThis is related to:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/9795\r\n* https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/6490","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/37830","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support for `$(TargetFrameworks)` per `$(RuntimeIdentifier)` (RID)\" (#37830)"},{"Id":"2070600563","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-08T20:20:51","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"37821","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:4491d9a4-839d-4af5-f3e4-08d8e97c775d)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore\r\n- **Subscription**: 4491d9a4-839d-4af5-f3e4-08d8e97c775d\r\n- **Build**: 20240108.4\r\n- **Date Produced**: January 8, 2024 4:35:31 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: e1758535a7f9922a61a919ebbc26be06f70fa5a1\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **dotnet-dev-certs**: [from 9.0.0-alpha.1.24056.2 to 9.0.0-alpha.1.24058.4][5]\r\n  - **dotnet-user-jwts**: [from 9.0.0-alpha.1.24056.2 to 9.0.0-alpha.1.24058.4][5]\r\n  - **dotnet-user-secrets**: [from 9.0.0-alpha.1.24056.2 to 9.0.0-alpha.1.24058.4][5]\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Analyzers**: [from 9.0.0-alpha.1.24056.2 to 9.0.0-alpha.1.24058.4][5]\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Ref**: [from 9.0.0-alpha.1.24056.2 to 9.0.0-alpha.1.24058.4][5]\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Ref.Internal**: [from 9.0.0-alpha.1.24056.2 to 9.0.0-alpha.1.24058.4][5]\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Runtime.win-x64**: [from 9.0.0-alpha.1.24056.2 to 9.0.0-alpha.1.24058.4][5]\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization**: [from 9.0.0-alpha.1.24056.2 to 9.0.0-alpha.1.24058.4][5]\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.SdkAnalyzers**: [from 9.0.0-alpha.1.24056.2 to 9.0.0-alpha.1.24058.4][5]\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web**: [from 9.0.0-alpha.1.24056.2 to 9.0.0-alpha.1.24058.4][5]\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.DeveloperCertificates.XPlat**: [from 9.0.0-alpha.1.24056.2 to 9.0.0-alpha.1.24058.4][5]\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Analyzers**: [from 9.0.0-alpha.1.24056.2 to 9.0.0-alpha.1.24058.4][5]\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Api.Analyzers**: [from 9.0.0-alpha.1.24056.2 to 9.0.0-alpha.1.24058.4][5]\r\n  - **Microsoft.AspNetCore.TestHost**: [from 9.0.0-alpha.1.24056.2 to 9.0.0-alpha.1.24058.4][5]\r\n  - **Microsoft.Extensions.FileProviders.Embedded**: [from 9.0.0-alpha.1.24056.2 to 9.0.0-alpha.1.24058.4][5]\r\n  - **Microsoft.JSInterop**: [from 9.0.0-alpha.1.24056.2 to 9.0.0-alpha.1.24058.4][5]\r\n  - **VS.Redist.Common.AspNetCore.SharedFramework.x64.9.0**: [from 9.0.0-alpha.1.24056.2 to 9.0.0-alpha.1.24058.4][5]\r\n\r\n[5]: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/compare/d117490fc8...e1758535a7\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:4491d9a4-839d-4af5-f3e4-08d8e97c775d)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/37821","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/aspnetcore\" (#37821)"},{"Id":"2071022048","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-08T20:05:14","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"37825","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/deployment-tools","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:3a70d678-3696-4da8-9503-08db3b921279)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/deployment-tools\r\n- **Subscription**: 3a70d678-3696-4da8-9503-08db3b921279\r\n- **Build**: 20240107.2\r\n- **Date Produced**: January 7, 2024 4:22:32 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: b4f8847a36543b3274dc252534d0175de35bd16c\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.Deployment.DotNet.Releases**: [from 2.0.0-preview.1.23612.2 to 2.0.0-preview.1.24057.2][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.SourceBuild.Intermediate.deployment-tools**: [from 9.0.0-preview.1.23612.2 to 9.0.0-preview.1.24057.2][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/deployment-tools/compare/fdef0932d9...b4f8847a36\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:3a70d678-3696-4da8-9503-08db3b921279)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/37825","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/deployment-tools\" (#37825)"},{"Id":"2071123089","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-08T19:53:37","Actor":"baronfel","Number":"37828","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Workload Sets] ensure that users can get a full listing of all installed workloads (including multiple versions)","State":"open","Body":"### Is your feature request related to a problem?

The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.

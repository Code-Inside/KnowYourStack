name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.17  Runtime or .NET 9.0.314 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.6  Runtime or .NET 9.0.107 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

When replacing one of them, the other goes away because replacing it with a collection expression would lead to overload ambiguity. However, I find this ugly. I ran into this situation with ScottPlot:\n\n```cs\nvar scatter = MainPlot.Plot.Add.Scatter(\n    [myData.xs.TakeWhile(n => n != 0)],\n    yPoints(myData).TakeWhile(n => n != 0).ToArray(),\n    color);\n```\n\nI don't know if it's possible, but ideally the analyzer would recognize this situation. \n\nThis could be fixed on the language level if a \"natural type\" existed for collection expressions. Even if there wasn't a natural type, perhaps the language could prefer one overload over another in this scenario."},{"Id":"51879268375","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-07-09T13:20:23","Actor":"akoeplinger","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/79147","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"[main] Source code updates from dotnet/dotnet\" (#79147) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"\n> [!NOTE]\n> This is a codeflow update.

On Windows Server 2016, the problem occurred recently because .NET SDK 8 was updated to 8.0.411 as part of a security update.\n\nVisual Studio 17.14.8 and SSMS 21.4.8 installed.\n\n.NET SDK 8.0.412 installed using the standalone installer.\n\nThe problem is that the Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces.MSBuild.BuildHost.exe file is missing from the dotnet-format subfolder.\n\nIf you install .NET SDK 8.0.412 and look at the folders\n\nc:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\8.0.412\\DotnetTools\\dotnet-format\\BuildHost-net472\\\nc:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\8.0.412\\DotnetTools\\dotnet-watch\\8.0.412-servicing.25320.8\\tools\\net8.0\\any\\BuildHost-net472\\\n\nyou will find that Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces.MSBuild.BuildHost.exe is missing from the former. All other files in those folders and their subfolders are identical. This is clearly a bug/omission in the distribution of .NET 8 SDK.\n\nTo fix this, you have to open a command prompt and run the following command:\n\ncopy /B \"c:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\8.0.412\\DotnetTools\\dotnet-watch\\8.0.412-servicing.25320.8\\tools\\net8.0\\any\\BuildHost-net472\\Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces.MSBuild.BuildHost.exe\" \"c:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\8.0.412\\DotnetTools\\dotnet-format\\BuildHost-net472\\Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces.MSBuild.BuildHost.exe\"\n\nRunning a similar (paths changing) command has now been necessary for 8.0.409 through 8.0.412.\n\nNote: Changing our target to .NET 9 (including our global.json) file might have fixed the problem as the .NET SDK 9 distributions do not seem to suffer from this problem, but we are not planning on switching to a new version before .NET 10 has been released, i.e., skipping .NET 9."},{"Id":"51882113436","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-07-09T14:16:47","Actor":"github-actions[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/49715","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[automated] Merge branch 'release/9.0.1xx' => 'release/9.0.3xx'\" (#49715) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"I detected changes in the release/9.0.1xx branch which have not been merged yet to release/9.0.3xx.

The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

The existing `Combine` operator causes the downstream pipeline to re-evaluate whenever *either* side changes. While this behaviour is appropriate in general, it introduces inefficiencies in common generator workflows.\n\nAn optimal generator needs to:\n\n1. Determine as cheaply as possible list of \"inputs\" that determine whether generation should occur. This can often be done via syntax analysis only without semantic analysis.\n2. Later enrich those inputs with additional contextual dataâ€”often requiring semantic model accessâ€”to produce the final output.\n\nDue to the design of the current API, developers are forced to perform all semantic enrichment during the `transform` step of `CreateSyntaxProvider`, because that is the only stage where `SemanticModel` is available. Attempting `Combine` with `context.CompilationProvider`  will lead to complete loss of incremental generation since compilation changes on every keystroke. As such, all semantic computation (even that which is only relevant for final source rendering vs equivalency checks) needs to happen inside `transform` delegate. As such the object coming out of `CreateSyntaxProvider` must be \"cache friendly\". Critically, developers must avoid passing `ISymbol` instances through `IncrementalValuesProvider` pipelines. Doing so causes the previous `Compilation` to be rooted in the incremental cache, leading to expensive and unnecessary cache invalidations. `SyntaxNode` can be passed downstream safely *only* if either:\n\n- It is excluded from equality comparison logic, or\n- A custom `IEqualityComparer` is used to ignore its reference identity (which is not value-comparable by default).\n\nThis leads to developers having to either having to create bulky model objects that must preemptively capture all possibly needed semantic dataâ€”even for unchanged inputsâ€”just to preserve cache correctness, or generating final source output right in template. Alternatively they must compute the final string output right inside `transform` method and use that as the cache key. In both instances they will need to query semantic model which may not be necessary for minimal set of data that forms cache key. This undermines the purpose of a multi-step pipeline and can result in redundant semantic analysis.\n\nThe proposed `Attach` API enables a safe and efficient pattern: combine key-driven model tied to actual \"incremental value change\" (such as those coming from `CreateSyntaxProvider`) with a context value (such as `Compilation` snapshot obtained from `context.CompilationProvider`), in a way that guarantees recomputation only when \"one side\" changes, not \"either\" like in `Combine`. This permits semantic enrichment to occur *after* determining that a generation is needed, minimizing both semantic model overhead and cache churn. Even in scenarios where semantic information may need to be resolved twice (first in transform and then in Attach), if we can avoid accessing semantic model entirely due to cache hits driven by pure syntax model, it is likely a worthy tradeoff.\n\n\n\n## Proposed API\n\n```diff\nnamespace Microsoft.CodeAnalysis;\n\npublic static class IncrementalValueProviderExtensions\n{\n+    public static IncrementalValueProvider<TResult> Attach<TLeft, TRight, TResult>(\n+        this IncrementalValuesProvider<TLeft> left,\n+        IncrementalValueProvider<TRight> right,\n+        Func<TLeft, TRight, TResult> transform)\n+        where TLeft : notnull;\n}\n```\n\nThis method behaves similarly to `Combine`, but only propagates changes downstream when the **left** input changes. The **right** input is available for enrichment or context purposes (e.g., compilation or semantic model) but does not trigger recomputation on its own.\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n``` C#\nvar syntaxModels = context.SyntaxProvider\n    .CreateSyntaxProvider(\n        predicate: static (node, _) => node.IsPartialTypeDeclaration(),\n        transform: static (context, _) => new ReducedModel(context.Node))\n    .WithComparer(ReducedModelKeyComparer.Instance); // Node is carried, but not part of the comparison. \n\nvar renderingView = syntaxModels.Attach(context.CompilationProvider, static (generationModel, compilation) =>\n{\n    \n    // we only arrive here if we determined that \n    // Compilation is used to enrich the model, but doesn't trigger incremental change on its own\n    \n    var semanticModel = compilation.GetSemanticModel(generationModel.Node);\n    return RenderModel(generationModel, semanticModel); // this is our source \"view\" that can use our custom model, node in it and semantic model to generate rendered source string\n});\n\ncontext.RegisterSourceOutput(renderingView, static (ctx, data) =>\n{\n    var source = SourceRenderer.Render(data);\n    ctx.AddSource(data.FileNameHint, source);\n});\n```\n\n## Alternative Designs\n\nOverload to `Combine` that takes `propagateOnlyIfLeftChanged: bool` flag\n\n## Risks\n\n- Introducing a new propagation model might complicate mental models of the incremental pipeline, especially for less experienced users.\n- In some scenarios can lead to degradation of performance. This can happen when semantic model is resolved in `transform` and selection criteria for caching doesn't trigger often enough to be worth the creating SemanticModel twice (first in transform and later in pipeline). This can largely be mitigated through developer education to select optimal strategy.\n- No compatibility issues are expected, as this is a purely additive API.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/79322","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Introduce Attach operator for source generator pipeline triggering incremental output driven by only one source (instead of either like Combine)\" (#79322)"},{"Id":"3217207895","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-09T21:30:29","Actor":"dr1rrb","Number":"79320","RawContent":null,"Title":"HR fails when removing a property with an initializer from a partial class","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: net 9.0 / Microsoft.CodeAnalysis 4.14.0\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\n1.

It might be better as some `Try` API or in some `CSharpSyntaxGenerator` specific type.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/79314","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SyntaxGenerator is missing a few operator expression kinds\" (#79314)"},{"Id":"3215971528","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-09T15:19:00","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"79313","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Source code updates from dotnet/dotnet","State":"closed","Body":"\n> [!NOTE]\n> This is a codeflow update.

When replacing one of them, the other goes away because replacing it with a collection expression would lead to overload ambiguity. However, I find this ugly. I ran into this situation with ScottPlot:\n\n```cs\nvar scatter = MainPlot.Plot.Add.Scatter(\n    [myData.xs.TakeWhile(n => n != 0)],\n    yPoints(myData).TakeWhile(n => n != 0).ToArray(),\n    color);\n```\n\nI don't know if it's possible, but ideally the analyzer would recognize this situation. \n\nThis could be fixed on the language level if a \"natural type\" existed for collection expressions.

Binaries on Windows, but also bundled version information on all platforms. But in the VMR, the Linux and Mac verticals cannot build windowsdesktop, wpf, or winforms. This means that these properties end up with the N-1 (or last backflow) version. That leads to product issues where you can't target windowsdesktop on Linux or Mac. These bugs are subtle.\r\n\r\nLuckily, we can avoid a pretty horrible join point by relying on the fact that the version numbers for all the shared frameworks (and internal non-shipping versions) align across the core runtime runtime repos for all the version numbers in question. Use the runtime versions instead of windowsdesktop, wpf, and winforms versions.

Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019. On Windows Server 2016, the problem occurred recently because .NET SDK 8 was updated to 8.0.411 as part of a security update.\n\nVisual Studio 17.14.8 and SSMS 21.4.8 installed.\n\n.NET SDK 8.0.412 installed using the standalone installer.\n\nThe problem is that the Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces.MSBuild.BuildHost.exe file is missing from the dotnet-format subfolder.\n\nIf you install .NET SDK 8.0.412 and look at the folders\n\nc:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\8.0.412\\DotnetTools\\dotnet-format\\BuildHost-net472\\\nc:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\8.0.412\\DotnetTools\\dotnet-watch\\8.0.412-servicing.25320.8\\tools\\net8.0\\any\\BuildHost-net472\\\n\nyou will find that Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces.MSBuild.BuildHost.exe is missing from the former. All other files in those folders and their subfolders are identical. This is clearly a bug/omission in the distribution of .NET 8 SDK.\n\nTo fix this, you have to open a command prompt and run the following command:\n\ncopy /B \"c:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\8.0.412\\DotnetTools\\dotnet-watch\\8.0.412-servicing.25320.8\\tools\\net8.0\\any\\BuildHost-net472\\Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces.MSBuild.BuildHost.exe\" \"c:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\8.0.412\\DotnetTools\\dotnet-format\\BuildHost-net472\\Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces.MSBuild.BuildHost.exe\"\n\nRunning a similar (paths changing) command has now been necessary for 8.0.409 through 8.0.412.\n\nNote: Changing our target to .NET 9 (including our global.json) file might have fixed the problem as the .NET SDK 9 distributions do not seem to suffer from this problem, but we are not planning on switching to a new version before .NET 10 has been released, i.e., skipping .NET 9.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/49716","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"dotnet format fails after installing new version of the .NET 8 SDK due to missing executable\" (#49716)"},{"Id":"3216116443","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-09T14:16:45","Actor":"github-actions[bot]","Number":"49715","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/9.0.1xx' => 'release/9.0.3xx'","State":"open","Body":"I detected changes in the release/9.0.1xx branch which have not been merged yet to release/9.0.3xx.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

See that issue for discussion.\n\n.NET binaries and installers have moved to a new domain -- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` -- backed by a new Content Delivery Network (CDN). You may need to make changes to adjust.\n\nTracking issue: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9674\n\n> .NET Team Status:\n> - azureedge.net scream tests are starting\n> - See: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9676\n\n>  \n> Recommended action:\n> - Read [Critical: .NET Install links are changing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/critical-dotnet-install-links-are-changing/) for an overview.\n> - Update `azureedge.net` references\n> - Update local copies of install script\n> - Update pinned references to [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n> - Validate that firewall rules are resilient to using new domains.\n> \n> Last update: 2025.01.23\n> Next update: 2025.02.04\n\n## Context\n\nSome .NET binaries and installers have been hosted on Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) domains that end in `.azureedge.net`. These domains were hosted by [edg.io](https://edg.io/), which has [ceased operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/edgio-retirement-faq) due to bankruptcy. We [migrated to a new CDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/migrate-cdn-to-front-door) and will be using new domains going forward. \n\nWe expect`azureedge.net` domains to cease by 5/31 (at latest).\n\n## .NET Team Remediation\n\nNew domains were created:\n\n- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` for signed official builds\n- `ci.dot.net` for unsigned builds\n\nTest links for new CDN:\n\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nTest links for old CDN:\n\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nThe following resources have been updated to use new domains.\n\n- [`releases-index.json`](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json)\n- [.NET install script](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/)\n- [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n- [CI short links](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/pull/15365)\n\nOther changes are in progress.\n\n## User Remediation\n\nPlease make the following replacements:\n\n- `dotnetcli.azureedge.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n- `dotnetbuilds.blob.core.windows.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n\nAll the new domains are path-compatible with old domains, as they share the same origin.\n\nPlease also make the following changes:\n\n- Update local copies of the install script\n- Update setup-dotnet Action references\n- Validate that firewall rules work with the new domains\n\n## Install script\n\nThe [.NET install script](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script) is used to install .NET from our CDN. We are changing CDNs (documented in a following section), which requires us to change the install script to use the new CDN.\n\nUpdated scripts:\n\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh`\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.ps1`\n\nNotes: \n\n- Users who have local copies of these scripts will need to update their copies.\n- Users who rely on the remote copy (at the URLs above) do not need to do anything other than validate no observed change in behavior (due to new domains and CDNs being used).\n\nTracking PRs:\n\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #554](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/554)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #555](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/555)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts/issues #558](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/issues/558)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #564](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/564)\n- [dotnet/docs #44052](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/44052)\n\n## Official builds\n\nOfficial builds and JSON files are hosted via a CDN, available for use by the install script and other installers.\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net\n\nNotes:\n\n- Official builds are tested and signed by Microsoft. A `microsoft.com` domain was chosen to reflect that.\n- We also [plan to stop using dowload.visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9675) for new content. That CDN will continue to function.\n- [Microsoft.Deployment.DotNet.Releases](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Deployment.DotNet.Releases) has been [updated](https://github.com/dotnet/deployment-tools/pull/423)\n\nYou can change from old to new domains by changing the domain section of the URL. The other parts of the URL do not need to change.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nA set of short links are available for official builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/dotnet-sdk-win-x64.zip\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-x64.tar.gz\n \nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- Currently forward to:  https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net.\n- Will be changed to forward to: https://build.dotnet.microsoft.com.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in mid January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/core #9683](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9683)\n\n## CI builds\n\nContinuous integration (CI) builds are hosted via a CDN, available via the install script and GitHub README files.\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net\n\nNote: CI builds include a mix of tested and untested builds, signed and unsigned builds.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n\nA set of short links are available for CI builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/daily/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/dotnet-runtime-win-x64.exe\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-arm.tar.gz\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/10.0.1xx/daily/dotnet-sdk-osx-arm64.pkg\n\nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- New builds now forward to: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old builds forward to:  https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in mid January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/core #9683](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9683)\n\nCI build pages use the CI short links.\n\nExample build pages:\n\n- [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/project/dogfooding.md#daily-builds-table)\n- [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/README.md#nightly-builds)\n- [dotnet/sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/documentation/package-table.md)\n\n## Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions\n\n- Major versions tags for [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570) have been updated. References to pinned versions will require updating to the most recent version.\n- We expect that GitHub Enterprise Server will be addressed in January.\n- Azure DevOps [`UseDotnetTask`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/use-dotnet-v2?view=azure-pipelines) will be updated in January\n- We do not yet have a date for updating [Azure DevOps Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/server/).\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/336","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Critical: .NET install domains and URLs are changing\" (#336)"},{"Id":"2653140062","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T19:35:17","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"335","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET November 2024 Updates","State":"open","Body":"# .NET November 2024 Updates\n\nToday, we are releasing .NET 9 , .NET 8.0.11, and .NET 6.0.36 updates.\n\n* https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9599 \n* [.NET 9.0 Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0)\n* [.NET 8.0.11 and .NET SDK 8.0.404](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/8.0/8.0.11/8.0.11.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0))\n* [.NET 6.0.36 and .NET SDK 6.0.427](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.36/6.0.36.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0))\n\nAlso announced at [.NET Updates in November 2024](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-and-dotnet-framework-november-2024-servicing-updates/).\n\nThis issue will be updated if there are any additional releases during the month.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/335","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET November 2024 Updates\" (#335)"},{"Id":"2653127024","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T19:27:36","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"334","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-43498 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-43498 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\n\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 9.0.

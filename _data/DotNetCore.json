methods (#25770)","State":"closed","Body":"- Partial port of https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/25770 to 3.1 (only the main change, excludes unrelated cleanup)\r\n- Use native code slot for default interface methods so that `MethodDesc::GetNativeCode()` can retrieve the current native code entry point (instead of returning null as before), and code versioning can find a matching code version from the code start address\r\n- Interface methods currently require having a precode, so the \"method entry point\" can't be used to directly store the native code entry point\r\n- Reenabled a couple of default interface method tests under GCStress\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/25690\r\n\r\n### Customer impact\r\n\r\nMostly only affects some GCStress tests. The change can have harmless non-test effects, for example a default interface method may be jitted redundantly fewer times after the change (as expected), since before the change the call to `GetNativeCode()` here would always return null for a default interface method and the method may be jitted again unnecessarily.\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/867aa5e1141c8801796a80171a3749d944c6b9af/src/vm/codeversion.cpp#L2304-L2309\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the main purpose of the port is to fix some GCStress tests to make CI runs more reliable and useful for testing other fixes made to 3.1.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n@echesakovMSFT has verified that all related GCStress failures are fixed after the change on Windows arm64 where the issues were seen.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow:\r\n- The change has been in all of the 5.0 releases\r\n- The change makes tracking of the native code for default interface methods similar to other methods that have a precode and don't have a stable entry point, so the behavior would be more consistent with other types of methods\r\n- The native code slot for default interface methods is a pointer-size extra memory per such method, it wouldn't be significant as the number of such methods is typically low compared to other types of methods, and most other methods already use a native code slot","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[3.1] Use native code slot for default interface methods (#25770)\" (#28153)"},{"Id":"807495713","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-10T12:31:00","Actor":"briansull","Number":"28146","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Backport the fix for dotnet/runtime issue 46529","State":"closed","Body":"5.0.x version of this change: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47741\r\n\r\n### Incorrect behavior a 64-bit long with shift of 32 or more combined with a cast to int \r\n\r\nThe JIT generates incorrect code for this code pattern:\r\n\r\n`(int) (X << C)`\r\n\r\nwhere C >= 32 and\r\nand  X is anything with a potential side-effect and is 64-bit integer type\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nReported by customer who was migrating to .Net Core from the Desktop runtime.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nThis is a regression that was introduced in the .Net 3.X timeframe by \r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/19899\r\n\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\nFixes issue #47724","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28146","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Backport the fix for dotnet/runtime issue 46529\" (#28146)"},{"Id":"809951727","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-10T12:26:40","Actor":"davmason","Number":"28148","RawContent":null,"Title":"GCStress eventing fix","State":"closed","Body":"Port #26776 to 3.1. \r\n\r\nEventPipe had an issue where it would see a reentrant stackwalk during GCStress, which triggers asserts on checked or debug builds.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\nHaving tests fail under GCStress means we are less confident when preparing fixes for 3.1.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

This is true to such an extent that the compiler even synthesizes internal attributes for NullableAttribute (see on [SharpLab](https://sharplab.io/#v2:EYLgHgbALANALiAlgGwD4GIB2BXZyCGwyApgATGaEkCwAUHQAIBMpAwnQN52k+kMCMABgD8pALIAKAJSkAvAD5SOPAG46AXzpA==)) and IsByRefLikeAttribute.\r\n\r\nOther community analyzers take a similar approach, defining internal source attributes in the project that consumes the analyzer, and recognizing the attributes by full metadata name without regard to visibility or assembly, just as the compiler does with its attributes.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happens with non-attribute types like the `IsExternalInit` type used as a modreq to tell whether an accessor is `init` or `set`. The compiler doesn't care how many assemblies define it or what visibility it has, when it comes to the question of whether a particular modreq is `IsExternalInit`.\r\n\r\nBesides attribute types and modifier types, I'm not sure if the compiler treats other types in an assembly-agnostic way.

Create the following csproj file, named *Meta.csproj*. The msbuild locator section in my case was copied from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/updating-an-existing-application?view=vs-2019#use-microsoftbuildlocator), however, I had to up the version from 15.1.548 to 15.3.409, since this is the minimum version `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis` of version 3.9.0 supports, I think.\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  \r\n    <PropertyGroup>\r\n        <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\r\n        <TargetFramework>net4.8</TargetFramework>\r\n        <RootNamespace>Meta</RootNamespace>\r\n        <StartupObject>Meta.Program</StartupObject>\r\n    </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n    <ItemGroup>\r\n        <!-- Prevents copying msbuild dlls into the output directory.

All new repos will already use this naming. Over the next couple of months, we're going to rename the branches in our existing repos as well. We're using [GitHub's new tooling](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-01-19-support-for-renaming-an-existing-branch/) to make sure branch policies and PRs are automatically updated.\r\n\r\nHowever, this still requires some changes from you as well. This announcement describes the process and what you need to do on your end.\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a smaller list of repos and grow from there. Theses are the planned starting repos:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/project-system](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system) ✔ \r\n* [dotnet/llvm-project](https://github.com/dotnet/llvm-project) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/icu](https://github.com/dotnet/icu) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/xharness](https://github.com/dotnet/xharness) ✔\r\n* [mono/linker](https://github.com/mono/linker) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/docker-tools](https://github.com/dotnet/docker-tools) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/wcf](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/iot](https://github.com/dotnet/iot) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms) ✔\r\n\r\nWe're starting with a smaller list to ensure we catch all cases where we need to update corresponding configuration in our Arcade-based tooling (see [this fantastic blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/) on how we build .NET).\r\n\r\nOnce we have validated our checklist, each repo admin will rename the default branch at their own pace. We expect to complete all repos in the next couple of months.\r\n\r\n## What you can expect\r\n\r\n*We have a detailed guide you can find at <https://aka.ms/m2m-dotnet>. This is only the essentials.*\r\n\r\nWe'll add a sticky issue to each repo when we're about to rename the branch. We'll do this a few days before and we'll leave it there for two weeks.\r\n\r\n**You don't need to update your PRs**. If you submitted a PR against the old default branch, the GitHub tooling will automatically retarget your PR against the new default branch (main).\r\n\r\nFor sanity, **you should rename the default branch in your fork as well**. When you go to your fork, GitHub will guide you through this experience:\r\n\r\n![Rename branch in fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/105210186-92bdba80-5aff-11eb-99c9-0beb708fcf3f.png)\r\n\r\n**You will need to update the repos you cloned to your hard drive**.

If you don’t supply contact details, then responses will be anonymous.\r\n\r\n[Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ZLPVNX9?SourceRepo=dotnet%2Fannouncements)\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nFor discussion, please go to https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/36235.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/154","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Survey: repo contribution experience\" (#154)"},{"Id":"610977267","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-01T21:27:32","Actor":"brianrob","Number":"153","RawContent":null,"Title":"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core","State":"open","Body":"# JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\r\nIn November 2019, Intel announced the Jump Conditional Code (JCC) erratum which may occur under conditions involving jump instructions that span 64-byte boundaries.  Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.  Ratios greater than 1 mean the benchmark performed worse with the JCC microcode update applied.\r\n - Y: Count of benchmarks in the bucket.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210322/80840714-ba0bda80-8bb2-11ea-8869-07ec55182661.png)\r\n**While there are some outliers, for the most part, the benchmarks are clustered around a ratio of 1 with the most benchmarks in the 1.038 – 1.085 bucket, which represents single digit percentage degradation.**","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\" (#153)"},{"Id":"583170428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-17T17:16:09","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"152","RawContent":null,"Title":"March 2020 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on March 2020.

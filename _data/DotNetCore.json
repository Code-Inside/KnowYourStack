This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability which exists when .NET Core improperly handles web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against a .NET Core web application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.\r\n\r\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the .NET Core application.\r\n\r\n_The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the .NET Core web application handles web requests. The previous update contained an incomplete fix, the runtime and SDK version numbers have now been updated to the runtimes and SDKs that have the complete fix. This new issue has been created for users which subscribe to the announcements via email or other automated means which may not show issue changes._\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/36313\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\n* Any .NET Core 2.1 application running on .NET Core 2.1.19 or lower\r\n* Any .NET Core 3.1 application running on .NET Core 3.1.5 or lower\r\n* Any .NET 5 application running on .NET 5 Preview 3 or lower\r\n\r\nPlease note that .NET Core 3.0 is now out of support and all applications should be updated to 3.1.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software) you are exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET Core. If you have multiple versions of .NET Core installed you will need to install multiple runtimes, or SDKs depending on what you have installed. If you have installed one or more .NET Core SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio which will also update your .NET Core SDKs.\r\n\r\nYou can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.1 you should download and install Runtime 2.1.18 or SDK 2.1.515 (for Visual Studio 2017 v15.9), 2.1.612 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.0) or 2.1.807 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.2 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.1 you should download and install Runtime 3.1.4 or SDK 3.1.105 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.4) or 3.1.301 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.5 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1\r\n* For machines running .NET 5 Preview you should download and install .NET 5 Preview 4 when available from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple affected versions you must update the runtime or SDKs for each version.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

But changing that wouldn't help much, as a given package can already be present in the package cache.\r\n - The `Clean` target does not clean the R2R images\r\n\r\nThis means that you will end up with an outdated R2R image if you update a NuGet package and then republish the project, unless you delete the `obj` directory manually first.\r\n\r\nHere's how to reproduce this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndotnet new console\r\ndotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json -v 11.0.2\r\ndotnet publish -r win-x64 -p:PublishReadyToRun=true\r\ndotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json -v 12.0.3\r\ndotnet publish -r win-x64 -p:PublishReadyToRun=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` in the publish output will be the v11.0.2 version instead of v12.0.3.

CancellationTokenRegistration.Token after CTS.Dispose","State":"open","Body":"Ports https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/21417 from 2.2 to 2.1\r\n\r\n#### Description\r\n\r\nCTR.Token should never throw, but it's currently throwing an ObjectDisposedException if the associated CancellationTokenSource has been disposed.\r\n\r\nDetails: We added the CancellationTokenRegistration.Token property in .NET Core 2.1.  Since the CTR already knows with what token it's associated, allowing you to get the token from the CTR saves you from also needing to separately store the token, which lets you improve memory utilization by not carrying it around effectively twice.  We took advantage of that, for example, in FileStream's Read/WriteAsync operations, to decrease the size of the object allocated for those operations.  However, the CTR.Token property is incorrectly throwing an ObjectDisposedException if the associated CancellationTokenSource has been disposed, which introduces an ODE where there wasn't previously one (just accessing a CancellationToken you already had stored).  This is causing regressions in code that created a token source, registered with its token, and then disposed the source.\r\n\r\n#### Customer Impact\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\nExceptions on background threads that crash the process when performing operations like:\r\n```C#\r\nvar cts = new CancellationTokenSource();\r\nTask<int> t = fileStream.ReadAsync(..., cts.Token);\r\ncts.Dispose();\r\nint result = await t;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe fixed this in 2.2 but so far held off on backporting to 2.1 pending more customer data since it's an LTS release. Since then we've had 2 more reports (see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/37641) most recently a customer that says:\r\n\r\n> It may take the rest of the year to reach 3.1. In the meantime our servers are crashing and clients are getting mad! I can only apologize to them, mitigate the issues as best as possible and then blame you for not updating an LTS version!\r\n\r\nSince the change is very low risk -- it's been in the product since 2.2 -- we are proposing we now backport to 2.1\r\n\r\n#### Regression?\r\n\r\nYes.  It's not a regression in CancellationTokenRegistration.Token, which was only introduced in 2.1, but rather a regression in that it's behavior isn't matching code it was used to replace, so it's for example a regression in FileStream.Read/WriteAsync.\r\n\r\n#### Packaging reviewed? \r\n\r\nChange affects System.Private.CoreLib only.\r\n\r\n#### Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

The hand written Amd64 instruction parser was flaky and nearly impossible to maintain.\r\n\r\nThe problem arose because the debugger must determine the length and form of the instruction where the breakpoint is inserted. The original code was a minimal implementation which only covered the instruction form historically used by the JIT.  As new forms and especially intrinsics were added, the code was not updated because the complexity was far too high. \r\n\r\nWe completely missed decode of all x64 simd instruction forms.\r\n\r\nThe fix required was this substantial change. At the time we missed the 3.0 branch and we did not have sufficient feedback to consider backport to 3.x.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n+ This code was manually tested to fix the originally reported issue.\r\n  + Additionally the same code was tested for regressions in other areas.\r\n    + Trying a breakpoint on every line of code\r\n    + Stepping through every line of code \r\n+ The code has been in the 5.0 branch for more than 6 months with no new regressions\r\n  + Shipped in all .NET Core 5.0 previews to date\r\n  + Over the last 90 days, there have been \r\n     + 184K debugging sessions launched on .NET Core 5 previews\r\n     + from 3.3K unique MAC addresses\r\n  + We have no reports of issues linked to this fix\r\n+ The 5.0 code has been tested against recently reported similar issues\r\n  + We have several confirmation that this issue observed in 3.0/3.1 has been fixed by 5.0 \r\n+ The internal diagnostic test suite was amended to test for this issue and prevent further identical regressions.\r\n+ @tommcdon & @hoyosjs have each used the x64 debugger since this change for debugging various reported/discovered issues. They saw no issues suggesting a regression.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\nLow. \r\n+ dotnet/coreclr#25958 has been in 5.0 since 9/2019\r\n+ Only affects x64 debugger operation. \r\n+ Removes a flaky instruction parser and replaces it with a machine generated one.  \r\n  + Rewrites one function `NativeWalker::DecodeInstructionForPatchSkip()`.  Used only for debugging x64 code.\r\n  + Adds 1 new machine generated instruction decode table. (10k lines)\r\n+ Adds tools to regenerate the parser tables\r\n  + Add 3 files to archive the tool used to generate the decode table.to machine generate.

A usage pattern that worsens this leak is to start tracing, fill up all the buffers, then stop tracing, and repeat that many times. This fix mitigates the issue by making EventPipeBuffer to use ClrVirtualAlloc instead of malloc.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\nOn Linux platforms (specifically ones that use glibc), customers may see an unexpected growth in the native heap size over a long period of time if using EventPipe for a long time (ex. using Application Insights Service Profiler), making our first-party and third-party tracing solutions potentially problematic in production scenarios when used for elongated periods of time.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\nNo, EventPipe buffers were always allocated using malloc.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nThe fix was tested against the scenario the customer provided and .

The implicit ref prevents this or other processes from attempting to destroy the mutex while it is locked. The implicit ref is removed in either of these cases:\r\n      - The mutex gets another reference from within the same process\r\n      - The thread that owns the lock exits and abandons the mutex, at which point that would be the last reference to the mutex and the process would not reference the mutex anymore\r\n  - The implementation based on file locks is less restricted, but for consistency that implementation also follows the same behavior\r\n- There was also a race between an exiting thread abandoning one of its locked named mutexes and another thread releasing the last reference to it, fixed by using the creation/deletion process lock to synchronize\r\n\r\nFix for https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/34271 in 3.1\r\n\r\n### Customer impact\r\n\r\n- Random crashes were seen on Unixes\r\n- When a named mutex is locked and the last reference to it is released from a different thread in any process, the underlying pthread mutex object is destroyed and that has undefined behavior. Crashes were seen where some data associated with the destroyed pthread mutex continues to be used when acquiring another pthread mutex in racy situations, causing a crash because the memory containing the destroyed pthread mutex is unmapped.\r\n- There was also a race where a thread has acquired the lock of a named mutex, between that thread exiting and abandoning the mutex, and another thread attempting to destroy the mutex\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- PAL named mutex tests on Linux and OSX including in stress mode (1 hour) in debug and release\r\n- System.Threading tests including mutex tests on Linux and OSX with debug and release coreclr\r\n- PAL, coreclr, and libraries tests\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow:\r\n- It is a bit of a corner case, where a lock is acquired and the mutex is disposed without releasing the lock, especially necessary for this issue is that the thread that disposes the mutex is different from the one that holds the lock\r\n- Since the fix involves extending the lifetime of a mutex in such a case, the underlying shared named mutex may observably live longer than before. That is necessary for correctness, as the behavior there was incorrect before and leading to the crashes.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28039","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[3.1] Fix Unix named mutex crash during some race conditions\" (#28039)"},{"Id":"613636507","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-07T17:26:33","Actor":"mikem8361","Number":"28037","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove SOS_README.md from every app's OutDir","State":"closed","Body":"Issue https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35888\r\n\r\nRuntime master repo PR: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/33878\r\n\r\n# Customer impact\r\nThe is causing customers' apps to fail with SOS_README.md not found. \r\n\r\n# Regression?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\nChange in runtime master already.\r\n\r\n# Risk\r\nLow.

This invalid state results in a null pointer being dereferenced in native code, which causes a crash of the runtime.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nInitially reported by a customer in dotnet/runtime#38704. On Linux-based environments, customers that explicitly or implicitly use `X509Chain` to build a certificate that cause an AIA fetch and the server improperly responds successfully but with empty content will cause a null pointer dereference in native code, which will result in an unrecoverable hard crash of the runtime.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nYes. Prior to .NET Core 3.0, a managed exception was thrown instead of an access violation.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThe original fix against dotnet/runtime contains a unit test to prevent further regressions. The test is not ported here due to missing testing faculties for AIA fetching.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n**Low**. The fix is to treat empty responses or any other response that results in a certificate with an invalid handle as an invalid response.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42942","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/3.1] Ignore 0-byte responses from AIA fetch.\" (#42942)"},{"Id":"647535840","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-29T17:11:33","Actor":"danmosemsft","Number":"42941","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Port SafeProcessHandle.Unix: fix missing DangerousRelease","State":"open","Body":"Port https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/37412\r\n\r\n###  Description\r\n\r\nPorts #37412.

An unknown status string causes a CryptographicException to be thrown due to the missing mappings.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to correctly handle these additional statuses, mapping them such that the behavior matches what Windows and Linux do.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nInitially reported by a customer in dotnet/runtime#35238. Customers that attempt to build an `X509Chain` on macOS with a certificate that causes one of the unknown statuses to be triggered will receive a `CryptographicException` instead of the `X509ChainStatusFlags` which other platforms correctly report. This may cause compatibility issues as developers are porting from other platforms to macOS.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nContains unit tests for all but the basic constraints scenario due to missing functionality in release 2.1 to aid testing. All are tested in dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n**Low.**  All of the new codes have been encountered in testing and measured against Windows for cross-platform consistency.  The existing tests ensure that the change isn't accidentally doing subtle remaps of established values.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42916","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR

There are still a few outstanding questions, and I'm not entirely sure if this is the right place to make changes that really affect the Solution and not the projects themselves.\r\n\r\nPotential TODOs:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add ApplyChangesKind\r\n- [ ] Add CanApplyProjectNameChange\r\n- [ ] Add separate FilePath change\r\n- [ ] Add other missing changes\r\n- [ ] Consolidate TryApplyChangesTests & GeneralWorkspaceTests\r\n\r\n## ApplyChangesKind / CanApplyProjectNameChange Addition\r\n\r\nIf we add something like `ApplyChangesKind.ProjectNameChange` to this I see a few ramifications. If someone passes changes to `Workspace.TryApplyChanges` that include a project name changes they will fail for all Workspace types that don't add the new `ApplyChangesKind` enum as supported.\r\n\r\n## Separate FilePath Change Addition\r\n\r\nToday `OnProjectNameChanged` changes both the project name and the file path. Should they be two separate changes? Should the added if conditional in `ApplyProjectChanges` check for FilePath changes?\r\n\r\n## Add Missing Changes\r\n\r\nThere's a list of additional properties that if changed will not cause the CurrentSolution to update as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\n- AssemblyName\r\n- OutputFilePath\r\n- OutputRefFilePath\r\n- DefaultNamespace\r\n\r\nShould these get similar paths like ProjectNameChange?\r\n\r\n### Consolidate TryApplyChangesTests and GeneralWorkspaceTests\r\n\r\nThese test classes look very similar in spirit.

Inserting `dotnet clean -r win-x64` after the first `publish` does not help.\r\n\r\nTo recap, I see two issues:\r\n\r\n - R2R images should be invalidated when the source assembly is modified, using something stronger than just the file timestamp\r\n - The `Clean` target should delete the R2R images\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/12379","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Caching issues with ReadyToRun images\" (#12379)"},{"Id":"652012629","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-07T17:36:14","Actor":"wli3","Number":"12371","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add _WorkloadLibraryPacksFolder","State":"closed","Body":"missing part caused by bad merge of https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/12314","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/12371","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add _WorkloadLibraryPacksFolder\" (#12371)"},{"Id":"652366827","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-07T16:54:24","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"12374","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/5.0.1xx-preview7] Update dependencies from microsoft/msbuild","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:0d6336ce-4600-406e-8c68-08d812f956ec)\r\n## From https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild\r\n- **Subscription**: 0d6336ce-4600-406e-8c68-08d812f956ec\r\n- **Build**: 20200706.3\r\n- **Date Produced**: 7/7/2020 2:12 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 96403c598a166e5a06933f78ace75528a1d1f3b0\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/vs16.7\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.Build.Localization**: from 16.7.0-preview-20330-08 to 16.7.0-preview-20356-03\r\n  - **Microsoft.Build**: from 16.7.0-preview-20330-08 to 16.7.0-preview-20356-03\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:0d6336ce-4600-406e-8c68-08d812f956ec)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/12374","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/5.0.1xx-preview7] Update dependencies from microsoft/msbuild\" (#12374)"},{"Id":"651826748","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-07T16:53:22","Actor":"eerhardt","Number":"12362","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add SDK Support for new runtime feature switches","State":"closed","Body":"Adds 3 runtimeconfig.json options introduced in .NET 5 that allow for code to be trimmed out of an application.\r\n\r\n* EventSource.IsSupported\r\n* UseSystemResourceKeys\r\n* EnableUnsafeUTF7Encoding\r\n\r\nAlso fixing InvariantGlobalization so it is passed to the linker correctly.\r\n\r\nContributes to #12217","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/12362","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add SDK Support for new runtime feature switches\" (#12362)"},{"Id":"652366806","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-07T16:44:29","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"12373","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from microsoft/msbuild","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:541ffb79-a58a-4b7b-321c-08d8080363b6)\r\n## From https://github.com/microsoft/msbuild\r\n- **Subscription**: 541ffb79-a58a-4b7b-321c-08d8080363b6\r\n- **Build**: 20200706.3\r\n- **Date Produced**: 7/7/2020 2:12 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 96403c598a166e5a06933f78ace75528a1d1f3b0\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/vs16.7\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.Build.Localization**: from 16.7.0-preview-20330-08 to 16.7.0-preview-20356-03\r\n  - **Microsoft.Build**: from 16.7.0-preview-20330-08 to 16.7.0-preview-20356-03\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:541ffb79-a58a-4b7b-321c-08d8080363b6)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/12373","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from microsoft/msbuild\" (#12373)"},{"Id":"652441427","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-07T16:02:33","Actor":"jaredpar","Number":"12375","RawContent":null,"Title":"Output from `dotnet new library` doesn't include classlib","State":"open","Body":"For whatever reason my brain wants to use `dotnet new library` to create C# class libraries.

We just walk the nuget cache directory structure starting with the reference assembly path and find the lib directory that has implementation assemblies. We gather implementation assemblies for all TFMs from there.\r\n\r\n[b] is more complicated. What need is a map of reference assembly identity to the MVID of the latest version of implementation assembly for each supported TFM.\r\nThis map would need to be updated as the products that ship the implementation assemblies evolve (both .NET Framework and .NET Core).\r\n\r\nThe main question is how would this map be distributed. Since .NET Framework doesn’t change that often, and if so the changes usually affect only a few source files, we could ship the map with the IDE and update it every time the IDE is updated.\r\n.NET SDK could also ship with the map and if there is a way to locate it reliably based on the location of the reference assembly.\r\n\r\nThe IDE would use this map as follows.\r\n\r\nWhen the user navigates from source file to a metadata symbol that comes from a reference assembly, the IDE queries the map to find a list of all TFMs that the reference has an implementation for.\r\nThe IDE considers the project context the current source file is opened in (displayed above the text buffer on the left in a combo box in VS). Based on the project context TFM it select the most appropriate TFM the reference assembly has an implementation for and queries the Microsoft symbol server for the MVID of the implementation assembly as well as for the PDB corresponding to this implementation assembly (both MVID and PDB ID would be stored in the map). Once the implementation assembly and PDB is available the IDE finds the metadata symbol in the implementation assembly and determines what source file contains its definition based on debug information in the PDB. It then uses Source Link record present in the PDB to locate the source file on GitHub, it downloads the source file and opens it in the editor. It also fills the project context combo-box with TFMs that the reference assembly is available for and with an extra item that represents the reference assembly itself. This allows the user to switch to a different TFM, repeat the above process and see the source of the symbol definition in other implementation assemblies, or just the declaration header of the reference assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/12360","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Provide mapping of reference assemblies to their implementations\"

If no one can reproduce an example described by me, then this is exclusively my personal case, and I'll just know that after installation of \"hosting bundle\" I'll delete x86 runtime\n\n---\n\n@joeloff commented on [Mon Jan 08 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1190#issuecomment-356049507)\n\n@aleha84 did you have previous hosting bundles installed before 2.0.4? In earlier versions of the hosting bundles we used to install the x86 runtime first. We've changed the order in later releases to run x64 first if it applies. However, if the runtime environment variables were previously configured, new runtime installs won't change their order since they already exist and the work around would be to manually change them under you system settings.\r\n\r\nThe hosting bundle also supports a command line switch, OPT_NO_X86. When you run the installer from the commandline and pass OPT_NO_X86=1, then it will only install the 64-bit runtime\r\n\n\n---\n\n@aleha84 commented on [Mon Jan 08 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1190#issuecomment-356051705)\n\nyes, previously i installed 1.1.4 and 1.1.5 versions. But i removed them all.\n\n---\n\n@joeloff commented on [Mon Jan 08 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1190#issuecomment-356052525)\n\nOk, so that might explain the issue. The hosting bundle actually wraps the runtime bundle. However the runtime bundles themselves don't actually remove the runtimes when they are uninstalled. You have to manually uninstall the runtimes (the bundles for the runtime actually wrap 3 separate windows installer packages).\n\n---\n\n@aleha84 commented on [Mon Jan 08 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1190#issuecomment-356053952)\n\nAs i described in step 1 to reproduce, I uninstalled all .Net Core components, such as SDK, Runtimes and hosting. \n\n---\n\n@Petermarcu commented on [Fri Mar 23 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1190#issuecomment-375712059)\n\n@Eilon do you know which repo this should be tracked in?\n\n---\n\n@joeloff commented on [Fri Mar 23 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1190#issuecomment-375714321)\n\nThis almost sounds that the 2.0.x and 2.1.x runtime/SDK installers aren't playing together in SxS situations.\n\n---\n\n@Petermarcu commented on [Fri Mar 23 2018](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1190#issuecomment-375715239)\n\n@rakeshsinghranchi @wli3 \n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/12356","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Installing DotNetCore.2.0.4-WindowsHosting.exe cause The SDK 'Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web' specified could not be found\" (#12356)"},{"Id":"651778922","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-01T16:38:14","Actor":"atorresGit","Number":"12355","RawContent":null,"Title":"Debian 8  packages have unmet dependencies for Core SDK 2.1","State":"open","Body":"## Steps to reproduce\r\nFollow instructions to install SDK from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/linux-package-manager/debian8/sdk-2.1.300. in fresh installation of Debian 8\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\nsudo apt-get install dotnet-sdk-2.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected  behavior\r\n2.1 SDK and all required dependencies should be installed\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get -f install dotnet-sdk-2.1 -s\r\nReading package lists...

When the App declare multiple frameworks there is currently no way from VS2017 to choose the runtime to debug with\r\n<TargetFrameworks>netcoreapp1.1;net462</TargetFrameworks>\r\n2. The AssemblyLoadContext is netcore specific even if it is inside the System.Runtime.Loader nestandard dll. This means I am required to if/endif in C# code to pick the `AssemblyLoadContext.Default.LoadFromAssemblyPath` or `Assembly.LoadFrom` method.\r\n3. When I want to load a plugin, I also need to know if its framework is compatible with the one the App is actually running (either nestandard or netcoreapp).\r\n3a. What is the best way to identify the current running framework?\r\n3b. How can I identify the framework used from a dll? I tried with metadata but I could not find any info (see here [https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/17309](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/17309).\r\n4. Identifying plugin dependencies. I need to deploy separately the App and the plugins (that can come from 3rd parties). This means that every plugin should be able to be shipped with all the required dependencies (as it already happens when you deploy an app with Self-Contained Deploying SCD). There is no current tooling in VS2017 or in the CLI to copy in a folder the required library dependencies. The deps.json file can be a starting point but a tool is required as the content may vary depending on the runtimes as well.\r\n5. When I manually load the plugin, its dependencies cannot be found automatically from the loader. For example If I reference System.Net.Ping 4.3 nuget package the runtime will look for System.Net.Ping.dll 4.0.1 (or similar). The only way to make the runtime load the plugin is to intercept the AssemblyResolving event (and AssemblyResolve for netstandard).\r\n6. Identifying missing dlls. There is still no fuslogvw tool (or similar) to identify failed bindings.\r\n7. If both the App and the plugin references, for example, System.IO package but in different versions, what is the best practice for managing version differences? The first (App) win? Or what?\r\n\r\n[A draft for a netstandard/netcoreapp loader is here](https://gist.github.com/raffaeler/f8cf7c87ff9cd8e48c2b608b95b7cff4)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/12351","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Assembly Loading in a mixed framework environment\" (#12351)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Announcements-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"635635668","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-09T17:37:53","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"158","RawContent":null,"Title":"June 2020 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on June 2020.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a remote code execution vulnerability exists in .NET software when the software fails to check the source markup of a file. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user.\r\n\r\nExploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of .NET Core. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file.\r\n\r\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Core checks the source markup of a file.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/2424\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nAny .NET Core application running on .NET Core 3.0.0, 3.0.1 or 3.1.0.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software) you are exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET Core. If you have multiple versions of .NET Core installed you will need to install multiple runtimes, or SDKs depending on what you have installed.\r\n\r\nYou can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  3.1.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.0, you should download and install Runtime 3.0.2 or SDK 3.0.102 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0.\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.1, you should download and install Runtime 3.1.1 or SDK 3.1.101 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1.\r\n\r\nIf you have both 3.0 and 3.1 installed, you need to install the updates for both versions.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This means [.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) is no longer supported and updates will no longer be provided.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files. But now you can enhance your localized Visual Studio development experience by adding the localized IntelliSense files from the download site into your local development environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, with this release we have made the localized IntelliSense available as zip archives that does require you to manually extract and copy the files to respective SDK install folders.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/133","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Repository Consolidation Timeline\" (#133)"},{"Id":"513963125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:55","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"132","RawContent":null,"Title":"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

With [.NET Standard 2.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-0/), we tried to make it much more viable to share code between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin which resulted in approximately 38K .NET Frameworks APIs being available in .NET Core 2.0. We also built the [Windows Compatibility Pack](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/) which made another 21K .NET Framework APIs available to .NET Core, resulting in almost 60K additional APIs. And in .NET Core 3.0 we added WPF and WinForms, which increased the number of .NET Framework APIs ported to .NET Core to over 120k, which is more than half of all .NET Framework APIs.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth pointing out that we added about 62K APIs to .NET Core that don’t exist in .NET Framework. If we compare their total number of APIs, .NET Core has about 80% of the API surface of .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/66777114-f8db7c80-ee7c-11e9-9161-acfe1c491586.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWe announced that the [future of .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/) will be based on .NET Core. And at Build 2019, [Scott Hunter stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlO1utbB2GQ&t=54m20s) that AppDomains, remoting, Web Forms, WCF server, and Windows Workflow won’t be ported to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 3.0, we’re at the point where we’ve ported all technologies that are required for modern workloads, be that desktop apps, mobile apps, console apps, web sites, or cloud services. That’s not to say that we don’t have any gaps or opportunities for new technologies, but we generally believe we won’t be finding them in the .NET Framework code base anymore. Moving forward, we’re focusing our resources on incorporating new technologies.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, we’re looking into releasing more of the [.NET Framework code base under the MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource) on GitHub to allow the community to create OSS projects for technologies we’re not intending to bring to .NET Core. For example, there already are community projects for [CoreWF](https://github.com/UiPath/corewf) and [CoreWCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF).\r\n\r\nWe’d like to thank everyone who filed issues with requests for APIs being ported. Those issues allowed us to prioritize and close the gaps that prevented people from porting to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nBut since we generally no longer plan to bring existing technologies from .NET Framework to .NET Core we’ll be closing all issues that are [labeled with port-to-core](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aport-to-core).\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this issue, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/41769.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/130","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 3.0 concludes the .NET Framework API porting project\" (#130)"},{"Id":"505445666","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-10T18:45:56","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"129","RawContent":null,"Title":"October 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on October 2019.

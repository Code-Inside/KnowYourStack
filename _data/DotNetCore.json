It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"702426498","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-16T06:07:11","Actor":"billvenhaus","Number":"1774","RawContent":null,"Title":"[UWP] HttpClientHandler - Digest Authentication Broken on Windows 10 PC","State":"closed","Body":"Just recently I found that my UWP app can no longer connect with Digest authentication on Windows 10 PCs.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption.

The build errors seem to be directly related to the changes in C#14.\n\n### To Reproduce\n<!--\nWe ❤ code!

In `IndentBlockFormattingRule.cs`, the `AddEmbeddedStatementsIndentationOperation` method excludes all `IfStatementSyntax` from indentation when they are the statement of an `ElseClauseSyntax`, regardless of whether they are on the same line or different lines.\n2. In `AnchorIndentationFormattingRule.cs`, an anchor indentation operation is added for ALL `StatementSyntax` nodes (including `IfStatementSyntax`), which preserves the relative position of the `if` keyword and prevents it from being indented.\n\n### Changes Made\n- [x] Understand the issue and locate the problematic code  \n- [x] Modified `IndentBlockFormattingRule.cs` to check if the `if` token is on the same line as the `else` token\n- [x] If on the same line: skip indentation (existing behavior for `else if`)\n- [x] If on different lines: add indent operation directly\n- [x] Modified `AnchorIndentationFormattingRule.cs` to skip adding anchor operation for `IfStatementSyntax` when it's on a separate line from its `else` keyword\n- [x] Added test `FormatElseIfOnSeparateLines` to validate the fix for separate lines\n- [x] Added test `FormatElseIfOnSameLineWithExtraSpaces` to validate spacing normalization for same-line case\n- [x] Added test `FormatElseReturnOnSeparateLines` (by @CyrusNajmabadi) to confirm indent mechanism works for other statement types\n- [x] Updated WorkItem links to reference the correct issue #16328\n- [ ] **BLOCKED**: Test for separate lines is still failing - investigating why anchor operation skip isn't working\n- [ ] Build and test the changes successfully\n- [ ] Run code review\n- [ ] Run codeql security check\n\n### Current Status\n**Test Results:**\n- ✅ `FormatElseIfOnSameLineWithExtraSpaces` - PASSES: When `else     if` (with extra spaces) is on the same line, it correctly formats to `else if` with a single space\n- ✅ `FormatElseReturnOnSeparateLines` - PASSES: Confirms indent mechanism works for other statement types (e.g., `return`)\n- ❌ `FormatElseIfOnSeparateLines` - FAILS: When `else` and `if` are on different lines, the `if` is not being indented\n\n**Investigation:**\nFound that `AnchorIndentationFormattingRule` adds an anchor operation for all statements (line 51-53), which preserves the relative position of the `if` keyword and prevents indentation. Added code to skip the anchor operation when there's a newline between `else` and `if`, but the test still fails. The logic appears correct but may not be executing as expected or there may be another source of anchor operations.\n\n<issue_title>if block not indented after else</issue_title>\n> **Version Used**: 2.0.0.61213\n> \n> ```C#\n> if (true) { }\n> else\n> if (false) { }\n> ```\n> should be auto-formatted (after typing `}` or explicitly formatting document) as\n> ```C#\n> if (true) { }\n> else\n>     if (false) { }\n> ```\n\n- Fixes dotnet/roslyn#16328\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>if block not indented after else</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>**Version Used**: 2.0.0.61213\r\n> \r\n> ```C#\r\n> if (true) { }\r\n> else\r\n> if (false) { }\r\n> ```\r\n> should be auto-formatted (after typing `}` or explicitly formatting document) as\r\n> ```C#\r\n> if (true) { }\r\n> else\r\n>     if (false) { }\r\n> ```</issue_description>\n> \n> <agent_instructions>@copilot see if you can figure out where this is happening.

It adds missing using so for `System.Text` namespace.\nAll tests pass except one where an empty positional record is given as input, something like:\n```cs\npublic record Test(int Prop);\n```\n\nTest expected output is:\n```cs\nusing System.Text;\n\npublic record Test(int Prop)\n{\n    public override string ToString()\n    {\n        //contents irrelevant\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe test fails because of mismatched output. The tests use lf as line ending in source files and they're run on linux, it seems that code generated by the refactoring correctly uses lf too and it works in all other tests. However, even though the output of this test (and only this test) is actually mostly correct, the `using` line added during import, and blank line after, use crlf line ending even though rest of the file uses lf. And that is the only difference.\nAdding blank line to the test input does not solve the issue, but for example, adding another positional record declaration fixes this problem. Replacing semicolon with pair of braces in separate lines fixes it too.\n\n**Version Used**: \n4.8.0\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\n\n1.

Load it in, make sure line endings in test sources are lf\n3. Run project tests.\n\n**Expected Behavior**:\nTests should pass. Or at least fail for a different reason.\n\n**Actual Behavior**:\nWhat actually happens is that all tests pass except test named `ToStringRefactoring_GeneratesToString_NoToStringAndRecordPositional(input: \"$$public record Test(int Prop);\\n\")`.\nWhen this test fails, the following exception is reported:\n```\nSystem.InvalidOperationException : Context: Code refactoring application\ncontent of '/0/Test0.cs' did not match.

Since `LabeledStatementSyntax` is an embedded statement owner, when a label is at column 0, the code would walk up to the label and use column 0 as the indentation.\n\n## Changes\n\n1. **Modified `CSharpIndentationService.Indenter.cs`**: Added a check in the while loop (line 229) to stop walking up past labeled statements. This ensures indentation is based on the statement following the label, not the label itself.\n\n2. **Added three test cases** (all marked with WorkItem attribute linking to issue #15866):\n   - `LabelAtColumn0WithIfStatement`: Tests the original issue scenario\n   - `LabelAtColumn0WithWhileStatement`: Tests with a while loop\n   - `IndentedLabelWithIfStatement`: Tests that the fix works even when the label is indented\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT SUFFIX -->\n\n\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Original prompt</summary>\n\n> \n> ----\n> \n> *This section details on the original issue you should resolve*\n> \n> <issue_title>Smart indent doesn't indent if there's a label at column 0</issue_title>\n> <issue_description>**Version Used**: VS2017RC\r\n> \r\n> **Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n> \r\n> 1.

The response from the `textDocument/diagnostic` request cannot be `null`. MS.CA.LanguageServer currently returns a `null` response in the case described here: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/76a39c1a97fe5c73549786fc6944dc188a7b7b3b/src/LanguageServer/Protocol/Handler/Diagnostics/DiagnosticSourceProviders/DiagnosticSourceManager.cs#L72-L80\r\nBecause the set of diagnostic handlers is empty, a response value is never generated for the request, and we fall through to returning `null`. Instead, explicitly return an empty list of diagnostics.\r\n\r\n2. Methods that take no parameters (e.g. `workspace/diagnostic/refresh`) were being sent with an empty array as the parameter value. This is because the `InvokeWithCancellationAsync` method in StreamJsonRpc normalizes unspecified arguments to an empty list. Use the `InvokeParameterObjectAsync` method instead, which don't do this.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/81174","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Improve LSP conformance in MS.CA.LanguageServer\" (#81174)"},{"Id":"3613905560","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-12T06:50:36","Actor":"Kinematics","Number":"81165","RawContent":null,"Title":"Source generator does not function inside an extension block","State":"closed","Body":"**Version Used**: Visual Studio 18.0.0, Compiler version: '5.0.0-2.25529.7 (68a9207c)'. Language version: preview.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\n\n1. Write an extension method with a source generator in the traditional format. It works.\n2. Write the same extension method using an extension block. It does not compile.\n\n**Sample code:**\n```\npublic static partial class LoggerMessages\n{\n    // Do not work:\n\n    extension(ILogger logger)\n    {\n        [GeneratedRegex(@\"PatternToFind\", RegexOptions.IgnoreCase, \"en-US\")]\n        public partial Regex PatternRegex1 { get; }\n\n        [LoggerMessage(\n            EventId = 100,\n            Level = LogLevel.Debug,\n            Message = \"An event happened.

The neutral (English) \nresources should be embedded in the main assembly.\n\n## Reproduction\n\ncsharp // On a system with German/French/etc Windows: using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp; using Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Scripting;\n// This triggers the error: var script = CSharpScript.Create(\"1 + 1\");``` \n\n**Error**\n\nCould not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.resources, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null'. The system cannot find the specified file.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nThe `NeutralResourcesLanguage` assembly attribute is either:\n1. Missing\n2. Incorrectly configured without `UltimateResourceFallbackLocation.MainAssembly`\n\nThis causes .NET's ResourceManager to search for a satellite assembly with \nneutral culture instead of using the resources embedded in the main assembly.\n\n## Proposed Fix\n\n### Option 1: Add/Fix Assembly Attribute (Recommended)\n\nIn `src/Compilers/CSharp/Portable/CSharpResources.Designer.cs` or assembly-level file:\n\ncsharp [assembly: NeutralResourcesLanguage(\"en\", UltimateResourceFallbackLocation.MainAssembly)]\n\nApply the same to:\n- `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis`\n- `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Workspaces`\n- `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Scripting`\n- `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.VisualBasic` (and related)\n- `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces`\n- `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Scripting`\n\n### Option 2: MSBuild Configuration\n\nEnsure `.csproj` files specify:\n<SatelliteResourceLanguages>en de;es;fr;it;ja;ko;pl;pt-BR;ru;tr;zh-Hans;zh-Hant</SatelliteResourceLanguages>\n\n(Note: `en` is deliberately excluded to keep it in the main assembly)\n\n## Workaround\nUsers currently need to add this to their application startup:\n\n\n`csharp AppDomain.CurrentDomain.AssemblyResolve += (sender, args) => { var name = new AssemblyName(args.Name); if (name.Name?.Contains(\"Microsoft.CodeAnalysis\") == true && name.Name.EndsWith(\".resources\")) { return Assembly.Load(name.Name.Replace(\".resources\", \"\")); } return null; };`\n\nOr add to their `.csproj`:\n<SatelliteResourceLanguages>en</SatelliteResourceLanguages>\n\n## Impact\n\nThis affects any application using Roslyn at runtime on non-English systems:\n- Scripting scenarios\n- Runtime code generation frameworks (e.g., WolverineFx, NServiceBus)\n- Code analyzers\n- IDE extensions\n\n## Environment\n\n- Roslyn: 4.14.0 (and likely earlier versions)\n- .NET: 8.0, 9.0\n- OS: Windows

We should have some level of (possibly manual) testing before we release.\n\nIf we continue to use the native hostfxr library (see https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/51689), this will be especially important because it is easy to have code that calls hostfxr that works in IL but not in NativeAOT.  Furthermore, it is important to test on entirely clean systems.  When testing on my dev box, NativeAOT code was able to load hostfxr.dll, presumably because the .NET MSI installer registers it globally or something.  The same code would fail when running on a clean sandbox.\n\nOne strategy we could use to test the NativeAOT version of dotnetup is to write tests that shell out to a `dotnetup` process, and use the new MTP test functionality so those tests themselves can be compiled as a NativeAOT app.  Then we could run those tests on a clean environment without any .NET SDK or runtime installed.

Since hostfxr is a native library, it doesn't get packaged in a single-file NativeAOT app.  So we need to figure out how to handle this.\n\nCurrently, after we install a .NET SDK, we try to load hostfxr.dll from the SDK we just installed.  This works for NativeAOT, but might not work if we depend on new APIs in hostfxr that aren't present in an older SDK we are installing.\n\nWe could drop the dependency on hostfxr and implement similar functionality in managed code.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.21  Runtime or .NET 8.0.318 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.10  Runtime or .NET 9.0.111 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest update) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

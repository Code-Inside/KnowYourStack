This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability which exists when .NET Core improperly handles web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against a .NET Core web application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.\r\n\r\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the .NET Core application.\r\n\r\n_The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the .NET Core web application handles web requests. The previous update contained an incomplete fix, the runtime and SDK version numbers have now been updated to the runtimes and SDKs that have the complete fix. This new issue has been created for users which subscribe to the announcements via email or other automated means which may not show issue changes._\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/36313\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\n* Any .NET Core 2.1 application running on .NET Core 2.1.19 or lower\r\n* Any .NET Core 3.1 application running on .NET Core 3.1.5 or lower\r\n* Any .NET 5 application running on .NET 5 Preview 3 or lower\r\n\r\nPlease note that .NET Core 3.0 is now out of support and all applications should be updated to 3.1.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software) you are exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET Core. If you have multiple versions of .NET Core installed you will need to install multiple runtimes, or SDKs depending on what you have installed. If you have installed one or more .NET Core SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio which will also update your .NET Core SDKs.\r\n\r\nYou can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.1 you should download and install Runtime 2.1.18 or SDK 2.1.515 (for Visual Studio 2017 v15.9), 2.1.612 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.0) or 2.1.807 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.2 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.1 you should download and install Runtime 3.1.4 or SDK 3.1.105 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.4) or 3.1.301 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.5 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1\r\n* For machines running .NET 5 Preview you should download and install .NET 5 Preview 4 when available from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple affected versions you must update the runtime or SDKs for each version.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

CancellationTokenRegistration.Token after CTS.Dispose","State":"open","Body":"Ports https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/21417 from 2.2 to 2.1\r\n\r\n#### Description\r\n\r\nCTR.Token should never throw, but it's currently throwing an ObjectDisposedException if the associated CancellationTokenSource has been disposed.\r\n\r\nDetails: We added the CancellationTokenRegistration.Token property in .NET Core 2.1.  Since the CTR already knows with what token it's associated, allowing you to get the token from the CTR saves you from also needing to separately store the token, which lets you improve memory utilization by not carrying it around effectively twice.  We took advantage of that, for example, in FileStream's Read/WriteAsync operations, to decrease the size of the object allocated for those operations.  However, the CTR.Token property is incorrectly throwing an ObjectDisposedException if the associated CancellationTokenSource has been disposed, which introduces an ODE where there wasn't previously one (just accessing a CancellationToken you already had stored).  This is causing regressions in code that created a token source, registered with its token, and then disposed the source.\r\n\r\n#### Customer Impact\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\nExceptions on background threads that crash the process when performing operations like:\r\n```C#\r\nvar cts = new CancellationTokenSource();\r\nTask<int> t = fileStream.ReadAsync(..., cts.Token);\r\ncts.Dispose();\r\nint result = await t;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe fixed this in 2.2 but so far held off on backporting to 2.1 pending more customer data since it's an LTS release. Since then we've had 2 more reports (see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/37641) most recently a customer that says:\r\n\r\n> It may take the rest of the year to reach 3.1. In the meantime our servers are crashing and clients are getting mad! I can only apologize to them, mitigate the issues as best as possible and then blame you for not updating an LTS version!\r\n\r\nSince the change is very low risk -- it's been in the product since 2.2 -- we are proposing we now backport to 2.1\r\n\r\n#### Regression?\r\n\r\nYes.  It's not a regression in CancellationTokenRegistration.Token, which was only introduced in 2.1, but rather a regression in that it's behavior isn't matching code it was used to replace, so it's for example a regression in FileStream.Read/WriteAsync.\r\n\r\n#### Packaging reviewed? \r\n\r\nChange affects System.Private.CoreLib only.\r\n\r\n#### Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

This PR ports that fix to _release/3.1_.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nSetting a debugger breakpoint on Amd64 (x64) can result in incorrect calculation of floating point values. \r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nThis was a known and difficult to fix issue. The hand written Amd64 instruction parser was flaky and nearly impossible to maintain.\r\n\r\nThe problem arose because the debugger must determine the length and form of the instruction where the breakpoint is inserted. The original code was a minimal implementation which only covered the instruction form historically used by the JIT.  As new forms and especially intrinsics were added, the code was not updated because the complexity was far too high. \r\n\r\nWe completely missed decode of all x64 simd instruction forms.\r\n\r\nThe fix required was this substantial change. At the time we missed the 3.0 branch and we did not have sufficient feedback to consider backport to 3.x.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n+ This code was manually tested to fix the originally reported issue.\r\n  + Additionally the same code was tested for regressions in other areas.\r\n    + Trying a breakpoint on every line of code\r\n    + Stepping through every line of code \r\n+ The code has been in the 5.0 branch for more than 6 months with no new regressions\r\n  + Shipped in all .NET Core 5.0 previews to date\r\n  + Over the last 90 days, there have been \r\n     + 184K debugging sessions launched on .NET Core 5 previews\r\n     + from 3.3K unique MAC addresses\r\n  + We have no reports of issues linked to this fix\r\n+ The 5.0 code has been tested against recently reported similar issues\r\n  + We have several confirmation that this issue observed in 3.0/3.1 has been fixed by 5.0 \r\n+ The internal diagnostic test suite was amended to test for this issue and prevent further identical regressions.\r\n+ @tommcdon & @hoyosjs have each used the x64 debugger since this change for debugging various reported/discovered issues.

A usage pattern that worsens this leak is to start tracing, fill up all the buffers, then stop tracing, and repeat that many times. This fix mitigates the issue by making EventPipeBuffer to use ClrVirtualAlloc instead of malloc.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\nOn Linux platforms (specifically ones that use glibc), customers may see an unexpected growth in the native heap size over a long period of time if using EventPipe for a long time (ex. using Application Insights Service Profiler), making our first-party and third-party tracing solutions potentially problematic in production scenarios when used for elongated periods of time.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\nNo, EventPipe buffers were always allocated using malloc.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nThe fix was tested against the scenario the customer provided and .

This started happening recently when client OS and docker containers disabled TLS v1.0 and v1.1, while target servers were not upgraded to TLS v1.2. \r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n**Medium:** The issue impacts Linux and Mac applications where servers are not ready to transition to TLS v1.2.\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\nNo, this issue is reproducible with all previous versions of .NET Core SqlClient drivers (impacts Managed SNI use-cases).\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nIn order to test this issue, a special setup is required on server side, to disable TLS v1.2 while the client only supports with TLSv1.2+. Local testing has been done to confirm the fix is applicable and the driver can now come out of infinite loop and throw exception.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n**Low:** The fix is not a major functional change, and it applies only to Linux/Mac customers if their servers are not updated to support TLS 1.2.

It enables some scenarios that where posible on the original proposal (the ones with replace and original keywords in the language) without adding the implementation complexity of it. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe current design of source generators is additive only and it may receive what the team call _IDE Integration_, understood as _design time generation_, the ones that doesn't receive this \"IDE Integration\" only runs at build time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis proposal is about providing an extension point around the following interface to enable **additive only mutations**.\r\n~~~cs\r\npublic interface ITransformer<T> \r\n    where T:Attribute\r\n{\r\n    BlockSyntax Transform(MethodInformation method,AttributeInformation att);\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n## Why allow editions?\r\nAOP and meta-programming (for more info on why allow editions read [this blog](https://medium.com/swlh/thinking-beyond-roslyn-source-generators-and-aspect-oriented-programming-3e42d58c37ac) \r\nfrom Gael Fraiteur, the creator of PostSharp).\r\n\r\n## Issues related to Editing\r\nAllow editing source code comes with a lot of headaches, here some of them:\r\n\r\n1. If multiple generators edit the same file, in what order they must run???, what input get each one???\r\n2. Performance on IDE may be poor since the current proposal states that generators run unordered.\r\n3. How to offer high fidelity Intellisense support for the modified Types.\r\n4. (The great one) Allow editions may be a great source for anti-patters and might create a lot of c# dialects destroying the \"what you see is what you get\" principle.    \r\n\r\n## Solutions\r\nAllow only **non-API** changes **non-API** changes mean disallow any changes on definitions. Having this restriction is imposible to modify a method signature, or even a type definition.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly changes to code blocks are allowed, and in C# this means methods and properties' body. (For simplification only methods' body transformers are explained here)\r\n\r\nWith **non-API** changes the interface of a type won't change and that also means that the Intellisense support for that type remains invariant after the edition.\r\n(This solves problem 3).\r\n\r\nIssues 1 and 2 are focused on performance to allow a great experience on the IDE. An important thing to notice is that there is not need to run the edit generators in design time thanks to the **non-API** changes rule and that is, in fact, very good for the IDE experience. \r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\nEach transformer must use an attribute to mark which method body is transformed. So multiple editions on a method are seen as multiple attributes on the method definition.\r\n\r\nComposition order is implicitly defined by the attributes:\r\n~~~cs\r\n[Timer]\r\n[Trace]\r\npublic void fibonacci(int n)=>\r\n    n<2?1:fibonacci(n-1)+fibonacci(n-2);\r\n~~~\r\n The compose order in the example is first apply Trace and then Timer.\r\n\r\n\r\nLets define TraceTransformer for the explanation:\r\n\r\n~~~cs\r\n//The attribute needed to use the transformer\r\npublic class TraceAttribute: Attribute{}\r\npublic class TraceTransformer: ITransformer<TraceAttribute>\r\n{\r\n    public BlockSyntax Transform(MethodInformation original, AttributeInformation attinfo)\r\n    {\r\n        return SyntaxFactory.ParseBlock($@\"{{\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"\"{original.Name}\"\"+\"\" started...\"\");\r\n            var result=original({original.Arguments.First().Name});\r\n            Console.WriteLine({original}+\"\" ended...\"\");\r\n        }}\");    \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n~~~ \r\n\r\nAnd also TimerTransformer:\r\n~~~cs\r\n//The attribute needed to use the transformer\r\npublic class TimerAttribute: Attribute{}\r\npublic class TimerTransformer: ITransformer<TimerAttribute>\r\n{\r\n    public BlockSyntax Transform(MethodInformation method,AttributeInformation att)\r\n    {\r\n        return SyntaxFactory.ParseBlock($@\"{{\r\n            var crono = new Stopwatch();\r\n            crono.Start();\r\n            var result=original({method.Arguments.First().Name});\r\n            crono.Stop();\r\n            Console.WriteLine({method.Name}+\"\" runs in \"\"+crono.ElapsedMilis+\"\" milliseconds\"\");\r\n        }}\");    \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n~~~ \r\n\r\nThe result of the composition operation on the previously defined fibonacci function is:\r\n\r\n~~~cs\r\nint fibonacci(int n)\r\n{\r\n    int original(int n)\r\n    {\r\n        int original(int n) => \r\n            n<2?1:fibonacci(n-1)+fibonacci(n-2);\r\n\r\n        Console.WriteLine(\"fibonacci\"+\" started...\");\r\n        var result = original(n);\r\n        Console.WriteLine(\"fibonacci\"+\" ended...\");\r\n        return result;\r\n    }\r\n    Stopwatch crono = new Stopwatch();\r\n    crono.Start();\r\n    var result = original(n);\r\n    crono.Stop();\r\n    Console.WriteLine(\"fibonacci\"+\" runs in \"+crono.ElapsedMilis+\" milliseconds.\");\r\n    return result;\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThe composition operation consists on defining a local function with the same signature that the method been transformed and with the body of the\r\nprevious transformer or in the base case the body of the method been transformed, but with name _\"original\"_. \r\n\r\nImportant things to notice:\r\n1. The composition is not defined in the transformer, so there is not user-code intervention here.\r\n2. The **non-API** changes rule allows all the local functions to have the same signature that the method been transformed without issues.\r\n3. All the nested local functions are named: 'original'. In this way, each transformer only has access to the output of the previous transformer and to the method been transformed.\r\n4. Since all the nested functions have the same signature, all parameters have the same names and there for only the inner-most are accessible to each function body.\r\n5. The user original function code is always inserted after the 'original' nested function, this allows that any user defined variable doesn't exist inside the corresponding original scope. (Is not captured by the closure)\r\n6. Each transformer gets the same methodInformation instance as input, so they can run unordered or even in parallel, the order is only needed to apply composition. \r\n7. The composition operator is a constant operation since it only adds the output of the previous transformer as a local definition.\r\n\r\n## Conclusions\r\nThis proposal may comply with most of common arguments against allowing source code editing at build time (source code weaving) in C#. Also it uses previous C# features, without need to add new keywords or constructs. It fits or complements C# 9's proposal additive source generators.\r\n\r\nCurrent proposal no complies with issue 4. Maybe because, there is not answer to solve it... it doesn't allow any transformation that breaks the principle of _\"what you see is what you get\"_ (even when C# compiler does some magic in several scenarios), then this current proposal of source generators  isn't allowed under that rule.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's important to remark that allowing transformers doesn't change the semantic of the language because it's true that it mutates source code, but it is an **additive only mutation**, so any error that exists before the transformation process exists also after it runs.  \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/45648","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Source Generator Safe Editions(Transformer)\" (#45648)"},{"Id":"650262057","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-04T01:32:18","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"45633","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge master to features/static-lambdas","State":"closed","Body":"\nThis is an automatically generated pull request from master into features/static-lambdas.\n\n``` bash\ngit fetch --all\ngit checkout merges/master-to-features/static-lambdas\ngit reset --hard upstream/features/static-lambdas\ngit merge upstream/master\n# Fix merge conflicts\ngit commit\ngit push upstream merges/master-to-features/static-lambdas --force\n```\nOnce all conflicts are resolved and all the tests pass, you are free to merge the pull request.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/45633","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Merge master to features/static-lambdas\" (#45633)"},{"Id":"650800576","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-04T00:33:39","Actor":"AlekseyTs","Number":"45647","RawContent":null,"Title":"Align addition of a synthesized record.Equals(record? other) in records with the latest design.","State":"open","Body":"Related to #45296.\r\n\r\nFrom specification:\r\nincludes a synthesized strongly-typed overload of `Equals(R? other)` where `R` is the record type.\r\nThe method is `public`, and the method is `virtual` unless the record type is `sealed`.\r\nThe method can be declared explicitly.\r\nIt is an error if the explicit declaration does not match the expected signature or accessibility, or the explicit declaration is not `virtual` and the record type is not `sealed`.\r\n```C#\r\npublic virtual bool Equals(R? other);\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/45647","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Align addition of a synthesized record.Equals(record? other) in records with the latest design.\" (#45647)"},{"Id":"650796582","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-04T00:02:54","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"45646","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge master to features/module-initializers","State":"open","Body":"\nThis is an automatically generated pull request from master into features/module-initializers.\n\n``` bash\ngit fetch --all\ngit checkout merges/master-to-features/module-initializers\ngit reset --hard upstream/features/module-initializers\ngit merge upstream/master\n# Fix merge conflicts\ngit commit\ngit push upstream merges/master-to-features/module-initializers --force\n```\nOnce all conflicts are resolved and all the tests pass, you are free to merge the pull request.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/45646","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Merge master to features/module-initializers\" (#45646)"},{"Id":"650724795","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-03T18:31:16","Actor":"ericwj","Number":"45645","RawContent":null,"Title":"Source Generators: Questions about files on disk and (build) options","State":"open","Body":"I have questions and a general call to simplify Source Generators\r\n\r\n**Version Used**: \r\n```XML\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Workspaces\" Version=\"3.7.0-2.final\" PrivateAssets=\"all\" />\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Analyzers\" Version=\"3.0.0\" PrivateAssets=\"all\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Questions**\r\nI read about obtaining settings from `SourceGeneratorContext` but afai can see `AnalyzerConfigOptions` and `GlobalOptions` as documented [here](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/docs/features/source-generators.md) have completely vanished - I tried installing older NuGets and still they're not there.\r\n* What is the current status of obtaining build options and to opt into receiving them in a source generator?\r\n* How to create/obtain logs and error information like stack traces short of `CS8785` and writing diagnostics? Especially while working on the source generator. I now misuse `Warning` just because anything less won't show up in VS.\r\n\r\nI might have misunderstood the [blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-c-source-generators/) and other communications about this feature, but I would really like and had expected Source Generators to be able to write `Source.g.cs` or `Source.Variant.g.cs` next besides `Source.cs` in the project folder if so designed, or if desired/configured by the developer consuming the source generator.\r\n* Is this planned? How to get files on disk that can be checked in? \r\n\r\nThe source generator happens to be randomly in either `$(ProjectDir)` or `C:\\....\\MSBuild\\Current\\Bin\\Roslyn`, hence what I do now is use environment variables and not call `AddSource`, but that is obviously not quite completely as desired. It does however provide me the complete view of the code being generated, the file in the proper location and the source able to be checked in.\r\n* Isn't it much more practical and quite a lot more intuitive than Guids and very long paths to use `$(ProjectDir)\\HintFile.g.cs` if the source generator isn't overwriting anything when calling `AddSource`. A simple annotation (not a guid) in a comment at the top of the file or something basic like that would tell the compiler who might overwrite the file.\r\n\r\nI don't think diagnostics like the one below are useful. For one, clicking on it doesn't do anything because the file does not exist.\r\n* How to develop a source generator that is sizeable and generates lots of code and figure out errors like duplicate overloads? I mean before writing tests to figure out what tests to write if at all.\r\n\r\nHowever as I find if the project doesn't build, the source generator doesn't run. So I now open the generated file and just `Ctrl+A`, `Del`ete all code before building so the generator will run.\r\n* Hence imo Roslyn should be able to link files to a source generator and run the generator if it finds (only) files generated have errors in them.\r\n\r\nAlso, the `AnalyzerReleases.*.md` files are very picky. Can these be slightly better documented or more flexibly parsed please? I tried writing one myself but I kept complaints until I copied one from github.

This leads to always having to press `arrow down` when a list appears. \n\nI think user defined namespaces should be first in the list, as you are more likely to want to use your defined type in the same project.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Visual Studio Feedback System on 6/27/2020, 11:51 PM: \n\nThank you for taking the time to provide your suggestion.&nbsp; We will do some

All it needs for a .NET Core app to run is a typically small `.*proj` file and the source files next to it.\r\n\r\nHowever, for very small programs (such as code for educational purposes or one-off scripts) whose project file is the same unremarkable one, it is a source of redundancy, especially when there are many source files on the same directory.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, and to emulate the behavior of tools like `python` and `node` with their respective languages, I am proposing to make commands like `dotnet run MyFile.cs` compile and run a single-source-file app.\r\n\r\nThis change will give a LINQPad-like feature to the .NET Core SDK and will make the .NET languages significantly more accessible and even enable them to be used like scripting languages.\r\n\r\nSome other details I have thought:\r\n\r\n*\r\n  A command like `dotnet run MyFile.cs` will behave like creating a project file like this:\r\n\r\n  ``` xml\r\n  <Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n    <PropertyGroup>\r\n      <Language>C#</Language>\r\n      <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>\r\n      <EnableDefaultCompileItems>false</EnableDefaultCompileItems>\r\n      <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>\r\n    </PropertyGroup>\r\n    <ItemGroup>\r\n      <Compile Include=\"MyFile.cs\"/>\r\n    </ItemGroup>\r\n  </Project>\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  and then running `dotnet run` on this. I intentionally included the `Language` element because the project file might not necessarily need to be stored on disk for its language to be determined by its extension.\r\n\r\n* The source file will have to be explicitly specified, even if only one source file exists in the current directory.\r\n\r\n* `dotnet run`ning a source file will work with any .NET Language (C#/VB/F#). It will not deprecate tools like F# Interactive, because it will not be interactive in the REPL sense of the term and because it will compile the sources first, instead of interpreting them.\r\n\r\n* `dotnet run`ning a source file will not support more than one source files.\r\n\r\n* `dotnet run`ning a source file will not support custom NuGet packages. Languages like F# that get their source library from NuGet will behave as if no specific `PackageReference` for that library was included.\r\n\r\n* Like the actual `dotnet run`, the framework could be customized with the `--framework` option and will default to the latest .NET (Core) version of the current SDK (after taking `global.json` into consideration).\r\n\r\n* `dotnet run`ning a source file will support running in either Release or Debug mode (and even allow attaching a debugger).\r\n  > In a divergence from the norm, we could default to Release mode here, for better performance.\r\n\r\n* `dotnet run`ning a source file will only support console apps. Libraries have no entry point and GUI apps typically need more than one file. CLI arguments will be passed after double dashes as usual.\r\n\r\n* `dotnet run`ning a source file will leave no trace in the file's directory. The compiled assembly will be cached somewhere else. Successive `dotnet run`s of the same source file with the same settings will not need a recompilation.\r\n\r\n* `dotnet run`ning a source file will not be extended to commands like `dotnet build` or `dotnet publish`","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/12328","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Idea: Support \"dotnet run\"ning single source files without a project file.\" (#12328)"},{"Id":"650386477","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-03T11:07:54","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"12327","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/aspnetcore","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:c0c2be01-34a3-46d9-31fe-08d7a4f3bc87)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore\r\n- **Subscription**: c0c2be01-34a3-46d9-31fe-08d7a4f3bc87\r\n- **Build**: 20200702.8\r\n- **Date Produced**: 7/3/2020 6:45 AM\r\n- **Commit**: 83448b47a0960aeb87169192f20888884796a243\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.  Ratios greater than 1 mean the benchmark performed worse with the JCC microcode update applied.\r\n - Y: Count of benchmarks in the bucket.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210322/80840714-ba0bda80-8bb2-11ea-8869-07ec55182661.png)\r\n**While there are some outliers, for the most part, the benchmarks are clustered around a ratio of 1 with the most benchmarks in the 1.038 – 1.085 bucket, which represents single digit percentage degradation.**","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\" (#153)"},{"Id":"583170428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-17T17:16:09","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"152","RawContent":null,"Title":"March 2020 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on March 2020.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

That means that .NET Core manifest tags are no longer usable on those Windows versions.\r\n\r\nIf you pull a manifest tag on one of the Windows versions described, you may get one of the following error messages:\r\n\r\n* `a Windows version 10.0.18362-based image is incompatible with a 10.0.17134 host`\r\n* `no matching manifest for windows/amd64 in the manifest list entries`\r\n* `no matching manifest for unknown in the manifest list entries`\r\n\r\nIf you need to still use Nano Server, version 1803 images (even though it is no longer supported), you will need to use tags that include the Nano Server version (these are non-manifest tags), for example `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:3.0-nanoserver-1803`.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/140","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Windows Server, version 1803 no longer supported by .NET Core\" (#140)"},{"Id":"522994983","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T17:15:08","Actor":"leecow","Number":"139","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3","State":"open","Body":".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3 is available and https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/3809 has been opened for discussion.\r\n\r\n[Release Notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/preview/3.1.0-preview3.md)\r\n[Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n\r\n**Blog posts**\r\n\r\n[.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n[ASP.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-core-3-1-preview-3/)\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues you find with .NET Core 3.1 Preview 3, either responding to this issue, creating a new issue or creating a new issue in one of the following repos:\r\n\r\n* [aspnet/Home](https://github.com/aspnet/Home) - for ASP.NET Core questions\r\n* [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore) - for Entity Framework Core questions\r\n* [dotnet/cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues) - for CLI tools and questions\r\n* [dotnet/corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues) - for API issues and questions\r\n* [dotnet/coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues) - for runtime issues\r\n* [dotnet/core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues) - for installer issues\r\n* [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues) - for Winforms issues\r\n* [dotnet/wpf](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues) - for WPF issues\r\n* [nuget/home](https://github.com/nuget/home/issues) - for NuGet questions and issues\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/139","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 3.1.0 Preview 3\" (#139)"},{"Id":"522864668","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-11-14T13:37:28","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"138","RawContent":null,"Title":"November 2019 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on November 2019.

Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/133","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Repository Consolidation Timeline\" (#133)"},{"Id":"513963125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:55","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"132","RawContent":null,"Title":"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

With [.NET Standard 2.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-0/), we tried to make it much more viable to share code between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin which resulted in approximately 38K .NET Frameworks APIs being available in .NET Core 2.0. We also built the [Windows Compatibility Pack](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/) which made another 21K .NET Framework APIs available to .NET Core, resulting in almost 60K additional APIs. And in .NET Core 3.0 we added WPF and WinForms, which increased the number of .NET Framework APIs ported to .NET Core to over 120k, which is more than half of all .NET Framework APIs.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth pointing out that we added about 62K APIs to .NET Core that don’t exist in .NET Framework. If we compare their total number of APIs, .NET Core has about 80% of the API surface of .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/66777114-f8db7c80-ee7c-11e9-9161-acfe1c491586.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWe announced that the [future of .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/) will be based on .NET Core. And at Build 2019, [Scott Hunter stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlO1utbB2GQ&t=54m20s) that AppDomains, remoting, Web Forms, WCF server, and Windows Workflow won’t be ported to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 3.0, we’re at the point where we’ve ported all technologies that are required for modern workloads, be that desktop apps, mobile apps, console apps, web sites, or cloud services. That’s not to say that we don’t have any gaps or opportunities for new technologies, but we generally believe we won’t be finding them in the .NET Framework code base anymore. Moving forward, we’re focusing our resources on incorporating new technologies.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, we’re looking into releasing more of the [.NET Framework code base under the MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource) on GitHub to allow the community to create OSS projects for technologies we’re not intending to bring to .NET Core. For example, there already are community projects for [CoreWF](https://github.com/UiPath/corewf) and [CoreWCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF).\r\n\r\nWe’d like to thank everyone who filed issues with requests for APIs being ported.

It's possible that the user might have an 8.0 SDK but only a 7.0 runtime installed; in that case, our language server will run with the 7.0 runtime, but will fail to find an MSBuild since the only one on the machine might be the 8.0 version which is not runnable. This enures we can still function in that scenario. We'll also fall back to using a .NET Framework MSBuild if somehow that's all you have.\r\n2. When we loaded an MSBuild, that sets environment variables, which might not be the same variables set if we're registering a different version in our child processes. But the environment variables might get inherited, which could result in surprises.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I'm also removing the fallback flag to enable in-proc builds; we never needed it and no bugs got filed, so just removing it for good.\r\n\r\nFixes https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1886993"},{"Id":"32326505967","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-10-05T01:37:20","Actor":"DavidThielen","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/70246","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Add MemberNotNullAttribute support for IQueryable<T> methods\" (#70246) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"Apologies if this is in the wrong section.

The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

Specifically, it had:\r\n\r\n1. Checksum - Standalone represents the raw SHA256 data.\r\n1.

However, by inheriting from ChecksumWithChildren it could not actually enforce this in its public contract.\r\n1. Solution/Project/DocumentChecksums.  Derivations of ChecksumWithChildren which only ever contained Checksums/ChecksumCollections, but again which would then expose an interface making it seem like they could have  deep hierarchy of children.\r\n\r\nAll this was very confusing, and led to lots of code needing to work with objects, blind casts, and recursion to handle arbitrarily deep trees.

A fix would be nice]\nIntelliSense supports the feature of automatically importing unimported items. \n\nHowever, unlike using Quick Fixes, it does not add `global` scope when required, such as when there is a preference to use using statements inside namespaces. Consider this:\n\n```csharp\nnamespace B\n{\n    using C;\n\n    public class TestClassA\n    {\n        public static void SomeMethod()\n        {\n             SomethingInC.ABCD();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nnamespace A.B\n{\n    // IntelliSense would add:\n    // using B;\n\n    public class Program\n    {\n         public static void Main()\n         {\n             TestClassA.SomeMethod(); // <- here\n         }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhen using IntelliSense unimported items feature to automatically add using _to_ `B.ClassA` in the above example would add `using B.ClassA`, but since the using statements are inside the A.B namespace, the compiler understands it as importing the `A.B` namespace (because somehow it searches relatively).\n\nQuick Fixes knows this and automatically adds the `global::` scope for you, but IntelliSense somehow just doesn't.\n\nTo reproduce the issue, use something similar to above example (the above example obviously doesn't compile) and try to use IntelliSense to reference TestClassA in `A.B.Program`. IntelliSense does not add `global::` scope and a compiler error will happen wherever IntelliSense adds it.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 10/3/2023, 01:52 AM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n\n---\n### Original Solutions\n(no solutions)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/70218","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"C#: IntelliSense unimported suggestion items does not automatically add global namespace to using statement it adds\" (#70218)"},{"Id":"1924614898","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-03T17:34:05","Actor":"jcouv","Number":"70217","RawContent":null,"Title":"GetConversion yields incorrect result on collection expression with spread in error case","State":"open","Body":"See `MissingCtor_GenericIEnumerable_Spread` in comparison to `MissingCtor_GenericIEnumerable`.\r\nThis issue is referenced in tests\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n        [Fact, WorkItem(\"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/69521\")]\r\n        public void MissingCtor_GenericIEnumerable()\r\n        {\r\n            string source = \"\"\"\r\n                using System.Collections;\r\n                using System.Collections.Generic;\r\n\r\n                C x = [1];

The value is currently part the `WorkloadInstallerFactory.GetWorkloadInstaller()`, so the provided `IWorkloadManifestInstaller` will contain and use this temp directory.\r\n  - Similarly, `_tempDirManifestPath` was not used in the mocked version for testing, so this was removed too.\r\n- Created a `WorkloadCollection` alias since a dictionary of `WorkloadId` to `WorkloadDefinition` is used in multiple places in the code.\r\n- Used deconstruction in many places to simplify readability.\r\n- Refactored `GetManifestPackageDownloadsAsync` into a loop since it was a series of if-statements that did the same logic 3 times in a row.\r\n- Ad-hoc formatting cleanup and some style simplification.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/35859","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Workload manifest updater cleanup\" (#35859)"},{"Id":"1925146891","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-04T23:06:54","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"35838","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/6.0.1xx' => 'release/6.0.3xx'","State":"closed","Body":"I detected changes in the release/6.0.1xx branch which have not been merged yet to release/6.0.3xx.

The warning was introduced because we changed the behavior (to not reference the trim analyzers, and to not mark the assembly with `[assembly: AssemblyMetadat(\"IsTrimmable\", \"True\")]`.\r\n\r\nThe intended way to fix this in a library was by multi-targeting the library to include a TFM supported by trimming, and to set `IsTrimmable` only on the supported TFMs. We got feedback (see https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/35528) that the warning was a painful break for multitargeted libraries, and that the warning shouldn't be produced in the first place for libraries following our guidance.\r\n\r\nThis change addresses it by silencing the warning for correctly multitargeted projects. The warning is silenced only when the multitargeting set includes a low enough supported TFM to ensure that the `IsTrimmable` assets will be consumed (instead of non-trimmable .NET Standard assets) in any supported app that references the library.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests passed without changes. Added tests to validate the behavior for various multitargeted projects. Added tests to ensure that the changes don't break the behavior of projects that use custom `TargetFramework` values as aliases for `TargetFrameworkIdentifier` and `TargetFrameworkVersion`.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nLow to medium. This change reduces overall impact of the breaking change by limiting the scope of the warning, but adds complexity to the behavior. The complexity is unlikely to be surfaced to the developer, but is observable (it would be confusing to any developer who tried to understand the specific circumstances under which the warning was produced).\r\n\r\n## Original description\r\n\r\n\r\nThe warnings introduced by\r\n https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/34077 and described in\r\n https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/compatibility/sdk/8.0/trimming-unsupported-targetframework\r\n are unnecessary noise for projects that multitarget to include a\r\n TargetFramework that is compatible with\r\n trimming/AOT/single-file, and is a low enough version to ensure\r\n that it will be picked over any other TFM's assets when the\r\n library is consumed in a trimmed/AOT'd/single-file app.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the issue by detecting correctly multi-targeted libraries and suppressing the warnings in these cases.\r\n\r\nNote that prior to the .NET 8 SDK, netstandard libraries would still get the `IsTrimmable` attribute embedded in the assembly when setting `IsTrimmable`, and could use trim analysis despite incomplete warnings due to unannotated ref assemblies. With the .NET 8 SDK this is no longer the case. Even for correctly multi-targeted libraries, the netstandard output assembly will no longer contain the `IsTrimmable` attribute. We debated whether it was worth warning in this case, but decided that the negative impact of the warning on library developers following the \"golden path\" was too large to justify keeping this as a warning.\r\n\r\nThis solution addresses a correctness problem that we wanted to avoid (the correctness problem: allowing an inadvertently non-\"trimmable\" netstandard asset to be consumed in a trimmed app that uses a supported TFM).\r\n\r\nIt's still possible to get into that situation in an app that explicitly references the netstandard assembly, or that targets an EOL TFM (causing it to consume the netstandard asset from a library that multitargets `netstandard2.0;net6.0` for example).\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/35528","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/35851","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/8.0.1xx] Detect correctly multitargeted apps for trim/AOT/single-file warnings\" (#35851)"},{"Id":"1926566443","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-04T16:14:58","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"35850","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/7.0.4xx' => 'release/8.0.1xx'","State":"open","Body":"I detected changes in the release/7.0.4xx branch which have not been merged yet to release/8.0.1xx.

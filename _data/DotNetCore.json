This caused a race-condition on the read/write on this list, causing a crash. The problem does not exist in the 5.0 fix, only for the 3.1 backport. \r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nMedium/High. When hit with this issue, a customer may experience a crash. A customer may run into this issue when they turn on the runtime counters (System.Runtime) or any other set of counter providers, and then modify the list of counters while a counter callback is happening by either creating or disposing instances of EventCounters. For customers that don't consume/create their own EventCounters, this shouldn't be a problem. For those who do, it's pretty easy to hit with the likelihood increasing the shorter they set the counter polling interval.\r\n\r\n## Regression \r\n\r\nYes.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

When getting diagnostics we must get the compilation ready for a project, then analyze all the files, getting semantic models, symbols and tons of binding information per file to compute the result.  However, once we report these diagnostics and go to fix any of them, the fixer must redo so much of the same work (not to mention in another process).  This includes again producing hte compilation all over agian, then almost certainly getting the semantic model for that file and producing tons of binding information.\r\n\r\nIt is likely we could vastly speed things up by moving more to a document-based approach for fixing everything.  Specifically, when doing a fix all, we could compute diagnostics for individual documents (likely in parallel).  Once diagnostics for a document were produced, we would ideally be able to send those immediately to the fixer, keeping the semantic model alive, so that any work the fixer needed to do could benefit from the semantic work already done and cached by the analyzer.\r\n\r\nThis belief stems from analysis of fix all traces.  In those traces we say a tremendous amount of time being used simply to build compilations/semantic-models/bind.

We first compute diagnostics in our OOP process, building compilations/semanticmodels/etc. to generate the diagnostics.  We then remote those back to VS to compute and invoke fixes.  This is problematic as computing fixes often needs exactly the same data that diagnostics needs (i.e. a fix has to go and semantically analyze as well to determine what to do).  This exacerbates the limitations we have from a 32bit VS, not to mention tying up critical resources (like memory/cpu/gc) that can impact the user is numerous ways.\r\n\r\nRecently, we had to do a lot of work just to ensure that we could run a fix-all to completion ***in process*** because of how costly these steps are.\r\n\r\nWe coudl likely greatly improve our situation if we allowed code-fixes to run out of proc.  The benefits would be several-fold:\r\n1. they could benefit from reusing the same compilations/semantic-data already just computed for diagnostics.\r\n2. they could benefit from the better runtime that our OOP runs on.\r\n3. they coudl benefit from things like servergc and whatnot.\r\n4. we could likely parallelize more work as we would not have to worry about resource starvation\r\n5. running in OOP has a vastly smaller impact on the VS experience htan running in proc due to lack of contention over things like the GC subsystem\r\n\r\nSome fixes would potentially need to stay in proc.  We've documented that some fix APIs run on the UI thread and can access their host.  There would certainly be fixes that would still need to do this.  However, those are in the minority and can be specially addressed in some manner.  My personal recommendation woudl be that we attempt to run *all* fixes in OOP by default, but we allow some sort of API marker for a fix to say it absolutely must run in process.  This would provide the largest benefit to the ecosystem, with some amount of associated pain as some fixers would have to be updated.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is to keep things running proc by default, and have a marker to make some run OOP.  However, this is less palatable to me as it is very unlikely we would get that many fixers actually moved over.  So the core problems would still likely remain for the majority of fixers out there.  It would be less painful, but we'd still be in the poorer position.\r\n\r\nThis belief stems from analysis of fix all traces. In those traces we say a tremendous amount of time being used simply to build compilations/semantic-models/bind. This work is definitely redundant as we already had to do this in the OOP process.  So we double all that time and effort just to run things in both processes.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/50347","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow CodeFixProviders/FixAllProviders to run out-of-process\" (#50347)"},{"Id":"782421420","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-08T21:57:52","Actor":"genlu","Number":"50345","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"Revert \"Refactoring to target EditorFeature to netstandard2\"\"","State":"open","Body":"Reverts dotnet/roslyn#50239\r\n\r\nFYI @dibarbet Looks like the insertion for p4 from master will start on Monday?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/50345","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Revert \"Revert \"Refactoring to target EditorFeature to netstandard2\"\"\" (#50345)"},{"Id":"782418026","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-08T21:50:02","Actor":"333fred","Number":"50344","RawContent":null,"Title":"Rename SyntaxPartKind.RecordName to RecordClassName","State":"open","Body":"Addresses part of https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/50297, followup from API review. @dotnet/roslyn-compiler for review.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/50344","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Rename SyntaxPartKind.RecordName to RecordClassName\" (#50344)"},{"Id":"782393730","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-08T21:02:01","Actor":"RikkiGibson","Number":"50343","RawContent":null,"Title":"Reuse test artifacts in integration tests","State":"open","Body":"It feels like we can save quite a bit of machine time and improve the run time for retries if we make it so integration tests can reuse the same windows build artifacts that are produced currently by roslyn-ci.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/50343","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Reuse test artifacts in integration tests\" (#50343)"},{"Id":"782380294","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-08T20:34:20","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"50342","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge \"Edit and Continue Debugging\" into one \"Update Code\"","State":"open","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity2.visualstudio.com/t/Merge-Edit-and-Continue-Debugging-into/1271465)._\n\n---\n<p>Repetitively pausing the debugging process before editing the code then continuing afterwards can personally decrease productivity especially for frequent small changes.

My problem is that code in these blocks does not have syntax highlighting or IntelliSense unless the condition being tested is true, and even compile errors in these blocks are ignored. This can lead to problems down the road when it comes to deploy the code - for instance, if you're coding in debug mode, you'll have to switch to release mode to see the other code paths.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.  Ratios greater than 1 mean the benchmark performed worse with the JCC microcode update applied.\r\n - Y: Count of benchmarks in the bucket.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210322/80840714-ba0bda80-8bb2-11ea-8869-07ec55182661.png)\r\n**While there are some outliers, for the most part, the benchmarks are clustered around a ratio of 1 with the most benchmarks in the 1.038 – 1.085 bucket, which represents single digit percentage degradation.**","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\" (#153)"},{"Id":"583170428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-17T17:16:09","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"152","RawContent":null,"Title":"March 2020 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on March 2020.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

That means that .NET Core manifest tags are no longer usable on those Windows versions.\r\n\r\nIf you pull a manifest tag on one of the Windows versions described, you may get one of the following error messages:\r\n\r\n* `a Windows version 10.0.18362-based image is incompatible with a 10.0.17134 host`\r\n* `no matching manifest for windows/amd64 in the manifest list entries`\r\n* `no matching manifest for unknown in the manifest list entries`\r\n\r\nIf you need to still use Nano Server, version 1803 images (even though it is no longer supported), you will need to use tags that include the Nano Server version (these are non-manifest tags), for example `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:3.0-nanoserver-1803`.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/140","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Windows Server, version 1803 no longer supported by .NET Core\" (#140)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1346897579183845376","CreatedAt":"2021-01-06T19:13:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"In this #dotNETConf session replay, we see how to build modern and type-safe front-end applications in React with F… https://t.co/IxH3b8o9BO","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod1.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publishing</a>","RetweetCount":32,"FavoriteCount":4,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1346857559601238016","CreatedAt":"2021-01-06T16:34:00+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Join @cecilphillip &amp; @david_dotnet on Jan 7th @ 5pm EST for a live chat about OmniSharp 👩🏻‍💻… https://t.co/7pAgjqDB23","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":11,"FavoriteCount":3,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1346846494066954240","CreatedAt":"2021-01-06T15:50:02+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"What does it take to make a flight simulator in C#?\nOn a smartphone? \n\n#dotNETRocks talks to @lauraviatrix about he… https://t.co/CSjjBwWnHJ","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod1.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publishing</a>","RetweetCount":37,"FavoriteCount":12,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1346611193784504321","CreatedAt":"2021-01-06T00:15:02+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Want to move to .NET 5? \n\nIn this session replay from #dotNETConf, you'll see how to approach porting projects from… https://t.co/xRoPjQ8rCQ","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod1.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publishing</a>","RetweetCount":85,"FavoriteCount":19,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1346548278020747264","CreatedAt":"2021-01-05T20:05:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"In today's #ASPNET Community stand-up, @spboyer shows off the new https://t.co/q4nz0xhk1w site, which lists open so… https://t.co/nUPKwYOH4x","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod1.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publishing</a>","RetweetCount":7,"FavoriteCount":1,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1346524615636561920","CreatedAt":"2021-01-05T18:31:00+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Take a tour of #EFCore 5.0 with @jeremylikness &amp; @ajcvickers\nas they show off some of the new features in the lates… https://t.co/C1FAxczarl","Source":"<a href=\"https://about.twitter.com/products/tweetdeck\" rel=\"nofollow\">TweetDeck</a>","RetweetCount":24,"FavoriteCount":4,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1346516562228908032","CreatedAt":"2021-01-05T17:59:00+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"We're now live doing API reviews. https://t.co/lXY8t8X5z6","Source":"<a href=\"https://restream.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restream.io</a>","RetweetCount":13,"FavoriteCount":1,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1346489138120433665","CreatedAt":"2021-01-05T16:10:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Continuing series...

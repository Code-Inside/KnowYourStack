It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

After some time, a malicious analyzer (or code fix) that can read sensitive private data somehow (such as credit cards) and send it over the wire is added. \r\nOr for example, intentionally pause or slow-down build for some large chunk time in that malicious analyzer.\r\n\r\nAnother scenario is where you have large number of analyzers and code fixes and want to explicitly run only subset, while others are disabled completely.\r\n\r\n##### Immediate remediation\r\n**How can end user disable it easily as immediate fix when found without stopping rest of 200 analyzers and 499 code fixes that aren't malicious?**\r\n\r\nThere's possibility of disabling/removing entire assembly. This however removes all analyzers, even remaining 200 analyzers and 499 code fixes which are useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, ESLint in JS/NodeJS ecosystem disables completely rules via configuration files. Their code isn't even run.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis issue is also related to https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/68998","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/69733","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Feature Suggestion] Disable execution of specific Roslyn analyzers or code fixes during build and design-time (live analysis)\" (#69733)"},{"Id":"1867879301","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-26T03:25:06","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"69729","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use raw strings in EditorFeatures tests","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/69729","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Use raw strings in EditorFeatures tests\" (#69729)"},{"Id":"1867550241","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-26T00:44:37","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"69725","RawContent":null,"Title":"Cache regexes used for embedded language detection","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1872648\r\n\r\nSupersedes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/69715","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/69725","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Cache regexes used for embedded language detection\" (#69725)"},{"Id":"1867799394","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-25T23:58:18","Actor":"jcouv","Number":"69727","RawContent":null,"Title":"Report missing diagnostic for typeless expression in binary operation","State":"open","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/69579","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/69727","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Report missing diagnostic for typeless expression in binary operation\" (#69727)"},{"Id":"1866007215","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-25T22:38:57","Actor":"ryzngard","Number":"69711","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add to assembly crossgen to avoid JIT increase","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes regression found in [internal builds](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_apps/hub/ms-vseng.pit-vsengPerf.pit-hub?targetBuild=34023.218.dn-bot.230824.032638.493511&targetBranch=main&targetPerfBuildId=8300456&runGroup=PerfDDRITs64&since=2023-08-24&baselineBuild=34023.218&baselineBranch=main)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/69711","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add to assembly crossgen to avoid JIT increase\" (#69711)"},{"Id":"1867632582","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-25T20:14:27","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"69726","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix NRT annotations in ASP.net EA api","State":"open","Body":"@captainsafia ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/69726","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix NRT annotations in ASP.net EA api\" (#69726)"},{"Id":"1867525471","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-25T20:02:38","Actor":"333fred","Number":"69724","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix typo","State":"closed","Body":"I typo'd a 5.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\n# Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\nBuilding the .NET product from individual product repos in the [dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet) organization is a complex process requiring orchestration infrastructure that is available only to Microsoft. This is a hindrance to the .NET community as it's currently not possible to easily reproduce the official product build in the open. Furthermore, the complexity of the official build and release infrastructure tends to grow over the years. This presents many reliability and sustainability challenges.  \r\n\r\nTo address the abovementioned issues, **we'd like to announce a new repository** - https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet - which is the first step on the way to simplify building and shipping of .NET and making the product build process transparent to and reproducible by the community.\r\n\r\nThis new repository is a **Virtual Monolithic Repository (VMR)**. It includes all the code needed to build the .NET SDK, mirrored from the individual product repos (such as [dotnet/roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) or [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime)). It also includes [source-build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build), our whole-product build system used to build .NET by our Linux partners.\r\n\r\nThe VMR has the following main characteristics:\r\n- **Monolithic** - The repository is monolithic so that a single commit fully identifies the whole source code necessary to build the .NET SDK\r\n- **Virtual** - It's a mirror (not a replacement) of the individual product repos that make up the whole product, placed side-by-side in one repository. Changes to the underlying individual product repositories are synchronized to the VMR.\r\n- **Experimental** - Currently, the repository is part of our initiative to streamline the release process, not meant to be depended on. We reserve the right to delete the current instance and create a new, different one in its stead. We expect the repository to be persistent by the release of .NET 8 Preview 1, planned for February, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe repository is a work-in-progress and has a lot of [limitations](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet#limitations) but we believe that even with these limitations it can be already useful in a variety of scenarios.\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Goals of the Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\n- The main purpose of the [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet) repository is to have all source code necessary to build the .NET product available in one repository and identified by a single commit.\r\n- The VMR also aims to become the place from which we release and service future versions of .NET to reduce the complexity of the product construction process. This should allow our partners and and 3rd parties to easily build, test and modify .NET using their custom infrastructure as well as make the process available to the community.\r\n- Lastly, we hope to solve other problems that the current multi-repo setup brings:\r\n  -  Enable developers to make and test changes spanning multiple repositories.\r\n  -  Fulfill requirements of .NET distro builders such as RedHat or Canonical to natively include .NET in their distribution repositories.\r\n  - Simplify scenarios such as client-run testing of bug fixes and improvements. The build should work in an offline environment too for certain platforms.\r\n  - Enable the standard [down-/up-stream open-source model](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md).\r\n  - More efficient pipeline for security fixes during the CVE pre-disclosure process.\r\n\r\n## 📖 Further reading\r\n\r\nIn case you are interested in knowing more about the why's and how's of VMR's purpose, design and architecture, you may find the following set of documents interesting:\r\n  - [VMR's Design and Operation](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Design-And-Operation.md)\r\n  - [Upstream/Downstream Relationships](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md)\r\n  - [Code and Build Workflow](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Code-And-Build-Workflow.md)\r\n  - [Strategy for Managing External Source Dependencies](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Strategy-For-External-Source.md)\r\n\r\nThe build of the VMR is made possible by the [.NET Source-Build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build).\r\n\r\n## 💬 Discussion\r\n\r\nYou can share your thoughts on the VMR or see what others are saying at https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/11584\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/241","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\" (#241)"},{"Id":"1440663435","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-08T18:02:27","Actor":"dcwhittaker","Number":"240","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET November 2022 Updates","State":"open","Body":"Microsoft released the following [.NET Updates in November 2022](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/november-2022-updates/).\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Releases </h2>\r\n\r\n* [.NET 6.0.11 and .NET SDK 6.0.111](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.11/6.0.11.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0))\r\n* [.NET Core 3.1.31 and .NET SDK 3.1.425](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1.31/3.1.31.md)  ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1))\r\n\r\nThis issue will be updated if there are any additional releases during the month.\r\n\r\n## Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?\r\n\r\nYour app may be affected by many security vulnerabilities if you have not been installing .NET 6 patches. \r\n\r\n[Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/cve.md) makes it easy to tell how many CVEs affect your app, given the .NET 6 patch version you currently have deployed.\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Support Policies</h2>\r\nMicrosoft support policies are defined in the following documents:\r\n\r\n* [Currently Supported Releases](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md)\r\n* [Microsoft .NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/240","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET November 2022 Updates\" (#240)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2023-08-28T03:30:19.351947Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":7506}

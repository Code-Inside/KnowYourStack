This failure is most commonly seen when creating new certificates via `CertificateRequest.CreateSelfSigned` or when loading a certificate and key from a PEM file (or files) with `X509Certificate2.CreateFromPem`, which utilize the affected methods.\r\n\r\nCallers of these methods on macOS 15 (\"Sequoia\") will receive a `CryptographicException`, specifically `Interop+AppleCrypto+AppleCommonCryptoCryptographicException: The specified item is no longer valid. It may have been deleted from the keychain.`  The `dotnet dev-certs https` command relies on `CertificateRequest.CreateSelfSigned` and fails with this error.\r\n\r\nThis issue is addressed in the upcoming .NET 6.0.34 release, scheduled for release in October 2024.\r\n\r\n## Root Cause\r\n\r\nmacOS 15 uses a different status code to indicate a key is not in a Keychain than prior versions do.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\nIf you have not already upgraded to macOS 15 from a prior version and use .NET, you are not impacted by this issue.  If you are planning to upgrade to macOS 15, the workaround is to upgrade to .NET 6.0.34 (scheduled for October 2024) prior to upgrading to macOS 15.\r\n\r\nLoading a certificate and its associated private key from a PKCS#12/PFX are not affected.  If you are using an application that supports loading a certificate (and associated private key) by either PFX or PEM, converting your PEM contents to PFX - and updating configuration appropriately - may unblock you.\r\n"},{"Id":"41807584592","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-09-10T21:26:32","Actor":"rbhanda","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/323","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \".NET 9 RC 1\" (#323) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# Announcement\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to announce the release of .NET 9 Release Candidate 1.\r\n\r\nThis release contains the following improvements:\r\n\r\n## **üìöLibraries**\r\n\r\n* [WebSocket `Keep-Alive` Ping and Timeout APIs](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#websocket-keep-alive-ping-and-timeout)\r\n* [Add ZLib, Brotli compression options](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#add-zlib-and-brotli-compression-options)\r\n* [Add TarEntry.DataOffset](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#add-tarentrydataoffset)\r\n* [`HttpClientFactory` no longer logs header values by default](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#httpclientfactory-no-longer-logs-header-values-by-default)\r\n* [Out-of-proc Meter wildcard listening](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#Out-of-proc-Meter-wildcard-listening)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md)\r\n\r\n## **üõ†Ô∏è SDK**\r\n\r\n* [Workload History](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/sdk.md#workload-history)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/sdk.md)\r\n\r\n## **üåê ASP.NET Core**\r\n\r\n* [Improvements to SignalR distributed tracing](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#improvements-to-signalr-distributed-tracing)\r\n* [Keep-alive timeout for WebSockets](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#keep-alive-timeout-for-websockets)\r\n* [Keyed DI in middleware](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#keyed-di-in-middleware)\r\n* [Override `InputNumber` type attribute](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#override-inputnumber-type-attribute)\r\n* [Trust the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate on Linux](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#trust-the-aspnet-core-https-development-certificate-on-linux)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md)\r\n\r\n## **üì± .NET MAUI**\r\n\r\n* [Added `HorizontalTextAlignment.Justify`](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/dotnetmaui.md#added-horizontaltextalignmentjustify)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/dotnetmaui.md)\r\n\r\n## Get started\r\n\r\nTo get started with .NET 9, [install the .NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0).\r\n\r\nIf you're on Windows using Visual Studio, we recommend installing the latest [Visual Studio 2022 preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/). .NET 9 is now can be installed directly through the Visual Studio installer starting with Visual Studio 2022 17.12 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nYou can also use Visual Studio Code and the [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) extension with .NET 9.\r\n\r\nYou can find [.NET 9 RC 1 Installer & Binaries](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/9.0.0-rc.1.md) on GitHub.\r\n\r\n## Team Announcements & Discussions\r\n\r\nDiscuss this release with the product teams on GitHub through the announcements for this release.\r\n\r\n* [.NET MAUI](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/discussions/24698)\r\n* ASP.NET Core(https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/discussions/57787)\r\n\r\n## Stay up-to-date with .NET 9\r\n\r\nYou can stay up-to-date with all the features of .NET 9 with:\r\n\r\n* [What's new in .NET 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-9/overview)\r\n* [What's new in ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/release-notes/aspnetcore-9.0)\r\n* [What's new in .NET MAUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/whats-new/dotnet-9)\r\n* [What's new in EF Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew)\r\n* [Breaking Changes in .NET 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/compatibility/9.0)\r\n* [.NET 9 Releases](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/README.md)\r\n\r\nFor .NET 9 previews we are utilizing GitHub Discussions to make announcements.

The entire machinery to register actions on scope or get registered actions has been non-thread safe since the driver was originally written by John Hamby few years ago.\r\n2. Registration action callbacks have worked fine as we create a separate analysis context and [HostAnalysisScope](http://source.roslyn.io/#Microsoft.CodeAnalysis/DiagnosticAnalyzer/DiagnosticStartAnalysisScope.cs,472) per analyzer, per callback. We could have still run into a race condition where a concurrent analyzer captured the `AnalysisContext` or `CompilationStartAnalysisContext` and invoked register action APIs from each nested actions, but it is unlikely for an analyzer to attempt such dynamic registration.\r\n3. [GetAnalyzerActionsAsync](http://source.roslyn.io/#Microsoft.CodeAnalysis/DiagnosticAnalyzer/AnalyzerManager.cs,146) invocations have worked fine as we used to invoke them only once at end of compilation start actions in the core analyzer driver, and during telemetry callbacks from the IDE driver, which did not happen concurrently for a single analyzer.\r\n4. With the introduction of `SymbolStartAction`, dynamic registration of actions can happen, but it will normally happen only on the `SymbolStartAnalysisContext` created per-symbol, per-analyzer, and hence making race conditions during registration still unlikely. However, the core analyzer driver now invokes the [GetAnalyzerActionsAsync](http://source.roslyn.io/#Microsoft.CodeAnalysis/DiagnosticAnalyzer/AnalyzerManager.cs,146) concurrently for each symbol, and this makes the race condition during this call extremely likely - note that this method is on the callstack on the bug being fixed here.\r\n\r\nMy recommendations:\r\n1. +1 on the change in this PR, as it fixes the more likely race condition observed in the FailFast.\r\n2. File a follow up issue to make `HostAnalysisScope` and its subtypes thread-safe, so we avoid all possible race conditions.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @mavasani in https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/29828_"},{"Id":"43012614263","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-10-19T22:37:21","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/30423","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Error List re-orders and scrolls after selecting one entry\" (#30423) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"I'm fixing a number of build errors following a merge.

The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

I propose the ability to have the same source file included multiple times with different defines being present/absent for each parsing.\n\nThe main reason why this would be desirable is to have the ability to provide `async` support without having to write the common parts of the method/class twice. Using partial classes one could simple use the preprocessor directives to provide a different method signature/head and call the corresponding `await`/`async` methods when necessary.\n\nHere a quick example of what this would look like.\n\n```cs\n// class needs to be partial\npartial class StreamHelper\n{\n#if Async\n    public static async IAsyncEnumerable<T> ParseLinesAsync<T>(Stream stream, IStringParser<T> parser, [EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken cancellationToken)\n#else\n    public static IEnumerable<T> ParseLines<T>(Stream stream, IStringParser<T> parser)\n#endif\n    {\n        using StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(stream, leaveOpen: true);\n        string? line;\n\n        while (true)\n        {\n#if Async\n            line = await sr.ReadLineAsync(cancellationToken).ConfigureAwait(false);\n#else\n            line = sr.ReadLine();\n#endif\n\n            // break at end-of-stream\n            if (line is null)\n                break;\n            // line comment starts with #\n            if (line.SkipWhile(c => char.IsWhiteSpace(c)).FirstOrDefault() is '#')\n                continue;\n\n            yield return parser.Parse(line);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhile async is the most common example one would think of, it could also be used in methods that require 99% the same code but only differ somewhere in the middle, with no convenient way to just repurpose the code. I believe, at the moment, this is usually done by adding a private `_Internal` method with a delegate to handle the task specific situations.\n\n```cs\npublic void DoThingA(object param1, object param2) => DoThingCommonInternal(param1, param2, DoThingAInternal);\npublic void DoThingB(object param1, object param2) => DoThingCommonInternal(param1, param2, DoThingBInternal);\n\nprivate void DoThingCommonInternal(object param1, object param2, Action handler)\n{\n    // common part for A and B\n\n    handler();\n\n    // common part for A and B\n}\nprivate void DoThingAInternal() { /* Handler for A specific things */ }\nprivate void DoThingBInternal() { /* Handler for B specific things */ }\n```\n\nWhen it could be shrunken down to this:\n```cs\n#if THING_A\npublic void DoThingA(object param1, object param2)\n#else\npublic void DoThingB(object param1, object param2)\n#endif\n{\n    // common part for A and B\n\n#if THING_A\n    { /* Handler for A specific things */ }\n#else\n    { /* Handler for B specific things */ }\n#endif\n\n    // common part for A and B\n}\n```\n\nAdmittedly, whether this is better or worse depends a lot on how different `ThingA` and `ThingB` here really are.\n\n\nA feature like this could be provided either on the necessary file itself, similar to how defines are provided now. Like `#multipass Async`. Or through the csproj file. Ideally though, the IDE would have to show all different renditions of the file with the different defines being active:\n\nFor example: Having `#multipass Async;Custom` on the file `StreamHelper.cs` could show up as:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c69f09b9-44af-4832-a6b9-0696be449810)\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/75537","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow Multi-Parsing of same file with different defines.\" (#75537)"},{"Id":"2593051940","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-16T21:01:05","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"75536","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update source-build team references","State":"open","Body":"The @dotnet/source-build-internal team is being deprecated.

[/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.10 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.20 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.10 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  None\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n```\n\nIDE: None\n\n### Checklist\n\n\n* The sequence of command-line parameters.\n  * `dotnet build -c Release Emet.FileSystems.csproj`\n* The contents of the compiler's .rsp response file.\n  * N/A\n* The precise version of the compiler used, and its referenced assemblies.\n* Same version number in `dotnet --info`\n*  The current directory path.\n  * Debug type is none so current directory doesn't go to output anyway\n* The binary contents of all files explicitly passed to the compiler either directly or indirectly, including:\n  * Source files\n    * Equivalent: `rm -rf Filesystems/bin FileSystems/obj` on both followed by `tar -cf - Emet.FileSystems | ssh tar -xf -`\n  * Referenced assemblies\n     * Equivalent due to same exact project file\n   * Referenced modules\n     * Equivalent due to same exact project file\n   * Resources\n     * Equivalent due to same exact project file\n   * The strong name key file\n      * None\n   * @ response files\n      * Equivalent due to same exact project file\n    * Analyzers\n      * Still at factory defaults on both machines\n    * Rulesets\n      * Still at factory defaults on both machines\n    * Other files that may be used by analyzers\n      * Still at factory defaults on both machines\n  * The current culture (for the language in which diagnostics and exception messages are produced).\n    * EN-US for both\n  * The default encoding (or the current code page) if the encoding isn't specified.\n    * All input files are 7 bit ASCII\n  * The existence, non-existence, and contents of files on the compiler's search paths (specified, for example, by -lib or -recurse).\n    * Equivalent due to same exact project file\n  * The Common Language Runtime (CLR) platform on which the compiler is run.\n    * dotnet --info is the same\n  * The value of %LIBPATH%, which can affect analyzer dependency loading.\n    * Seems to be a Windows thing; no such environment variable on Linux\n\n### Diff\n\nThis seems to be the important part of the diff of the hexdump of the files.\nI have attached both original hexdumps and the diff in a zip file.[hex.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17448053/hex.zip)\n\n\n```\n@@ -1897,31 +1897,32 @@\n 00007690  45 54 20 43 6f 72 65 20  73 75 70 70 6f 72 74 69  |ET Core supporti|\n 000076a0

(#44323)"},{"Id":"2599430604","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-19T17:31:18","Actor":"tmat","Number":"44322","RawContent":null,"Title":"Project graph restore","State":"open","Body":"dotnet-watch loaded the msbuild project graph before restoring the project. Capabilities, such as `<ProjectCapability Include=\"WebAssembly\" />` is only added in a props file of `microsoft.net.sdk.webassembly.pack` package. If the project node from the graph loaded before restore is queried for capabilities, it will not have the `WebAssembly` capability.\r\n\r\nThis causes dotnet-watch to fail to apply changes to WASM.\r\n\r\nThe change moves project graph loading after project evaluation is performed and includes restore target in the evaluation.\r\n\r\nThe issue wasn't caught before by existing dotnet-watch WASM test because the test helpers always run `dotnet build` before testing dotnet-watch behavior. The change removes this pre-build step, so that tests validate the correct dotnet-watch behavior on non-restored projects by default.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/44044","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/44322","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Project graph restore\" (#44322)"},{"Id":"2599098013","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-19T12:04:05","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"44321","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/roslyn","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:d5dc2a0a-0871-47fc-022d-08dc4502ccaa)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn\r\n- **Subscription**: d5dc2a0a-0871-47fc-022d-08dc4502ccaa\r\n- **Build**: 20241018.4\r\n- **Date Produced**: October 19, 2024 12:29:52 AM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 7d58a7f9776810eeec48034de606db6ef205b504\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.SourceBuild.Intermediate.roslyn**: [from 4.13.0-1.24517.9 to 4.13.0-1.24518.4][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis**: [from 4.13.0-1.24517.9 to 4.13.0-1.24518.4][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp**: [from 4.13.0-1.24517.9 to 4.13.0-1.24518.4][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.CodeStyle**: [from 4.13.0-1.24517.9 to 4.13.0-1.24518.4][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Features**: [from 4.13.0-1.24517.9 to 4.13.0-1.24518.4][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Workspaces**: [from 4.13.0-1.24517.9 to 4.13.0-1.24518.4][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces.MSBuild**: [from 4.13.0-1.24517.9 to 4.13.0-1.24518.4][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.Net.Compilers.Toolset**: [from 4.13.0-1.24517.9 to 4.13.0-1.24518.4][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.Net.Compilers.Toolset.Framework**: [from 4.13.0-1.24517.9 to 4.13.0-1.24518.4][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/compare/fd48dff6a7...7d58a7f977\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:d5dc2a0a-0871-47fc-022d-08dc4502ccaa)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/44321","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/roslyn\" (#44321)"},{"Id":"2599067593","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-19T11:30:26","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"44320","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/9.0.2xx] Update dependencies from nuget/nuget.client","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:a8a96eea-7948-4ef9-bb5a-debaa65eb629)\r\n## From https://github.com/nuget/nuget.client\r\n- **Subscription**: a8a96eea-7948-4ef9-bb5a-debaa65eb629\r\n- **Build**: 6.13.0.38\r\n- **Date Produced**: October 19, 2024 12:43:50 AM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 8b88f9e28677f39bd871f4edded2ea4f68b01ac7\r\n- **Branch**: dev\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.Build.NuGetSdkResolver**: [from 6.13.0-preview.1.23 to 6.13.0-preview.1.38][1]\r\n  - **NuGet.Build.Tasks**: [from 6.13.0-preview.1.23 to 6.13.0-preview.1.38][1]\r\n  - **NuGet.Build.Tasks.Console**: [from 6.13.0-preview.1.23 to 6.13.0-preview.1.38][1]\r\n  - **NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack**: [from 6.13.0-preview.1.23 to 6.13.0-preview.1.38][1]\r\n  - **NuGet.CommandLine.XPlat**: [from 6.13.0-preview.1.23 to 6.13.0-preview.1.38][1]\r\n  - **NuGet.Commands**: [from 6.13.0-preview.1.23 to 6.13.0-preview.1.38][1]\r\n  - **NuGet.Common**: [from 6.13.0-preview.1.23 to 6.13.0-preview.1.38][1]\r\n  - **NuGet.Configuration**: [from 6.13.0-preview.1.23 to 6.13.0-preview.1.38][1]\r\n  - **NuGet.Credentials**: [from 6.13.0-preview.1.23 to 6.13.0-preview.1.38][1]\r\n  - **NuGet.DependencyResolver.Core**: [from 6.13.0-preview.1.23 to 6.13.0-preview.1.38][1]\r\n  - **NuGet.Frameworks**: [from 6.13.0-preview.1.23 to 6.13.0-preview.1.38][1]\r\n  - **NuGet.LibraryModel**: [from 6.13.0-preview.1.23 to 6.13.0-preview.1.38][1]\r\n  - **NuGet.Localization**: [from 6.13.0-preview.1.23 to 6.13.0-preview.1.38][1]\r\n  - **NuGet.Packaging**: [from 6.13.0-preview.1.23 to 6.13.0-preview.1.38][1]\r\n  - **NuGet.ProjectModel**: [from 6.13.0-preview.1.23 to 6.13.0-preview.1.38][1]\r\n  - **NuGet.Protocol**: [from 6.13.0-preview.1.23 to 6.13.0-preview.1.38][1]\r\n  - **NuGet.Versioning**: [from 6.13.0-preview.1.23 to 6.13.0-preview.1.38][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/nuget/nuget.client/compare/1a8ca60673...8b88f9e286\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:a8a96eea-7948-4ef9-bb5a-debaa65eb629)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/44320","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/9.0.2xx] Update dependencies from nuget/nuget.client\" (#44320)"},{"Id":"2598553466","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-19T09:31:35","Actor":"akoeplinger","Number":"44314","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix installing dependencies in vmr-build.yml","State":"closed","Body":"I didn't notice that agent variables aren't available in template expressions.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nThe `CopyWithPrivateKey` methods that combine a certificate with its associated private key fail on macOS 15 when using in-memory (ephemeral) keys.  This failure is most commonly seen when creating new certificates via `CertificateRequest.CreateSelfSigned` or when loading a certificate and key from a PEM file (or files) with `X509Certificate2.CreateFromPem`, which utilize the affected methods.\r\n\r\nCallers of these methods on macOS 15 (\"Sequoia\") will receive a `CryptographicException`, specifically `Interop+AppleCrypto+AppleCommonCryptoCryptographicException: The specified item is no longer valid. It may have been deleted from the keychain.`  The `dotnet dev-certs https` command relies on `CertificateRequest.CreateSelfSigned` and fails with this error.\r\n\r\nThis issue affects .NET 6, .NET 8, and .NET 9. The issue is addressed in the upcoming .NET 6.0.34, .NET 8.0.10, and 9.0.0-rc2 releases, scheduled for release in October 2024.\r\n\r\n## Root Cause\r\n\r\nmacOS 15 uses a different status code to indicate a key is not in a Keychain than prior versions do.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\nIf you have not already upgraded to macOS 15 from a prior version and use .NET, you are not impacted by this issue.  If you are planning to upgrade to macOS 15, the workaround is to upgrade to .NET 6.0.34. .NET 8.0.10, or .NET 9.0.0-rc2 (scheduled for October 2024) prior to upgrading to macOS 15.\r\n\r\nLoading a certificate and its associated private key from a PKCS#12/PFX are not affected.  If you are using an application that supports loading a certificate (and associated private key) by either PFX or PEM, converting your PEM contents to PFX - and updating configuration appropriately - may unblock you.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/324","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Certificate Issues on macOS 15 (\"Sequoia\")\" (#324)"},{"Id":"2517880984","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-10T21:26:30","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"323","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 9 RC 1","State":"open","Body":"# Announcement\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to announce the release of .NET 9 Release Candidate 1.\r\n\r\nThis release contains the following improvements:\r\n\r\n## **üìöLibraries**\r\n\r\n* [WebSocket `Keep-Alive` Ping and Timeout APIs](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#websocket-keep-alive-ping-and-timeout)\r\n* [Add ZLib, Brotli compression options](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#add-zlib-and-brotli-compression-options)\r\n* [Add TarEntry.DataOffset](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#add-tarentrydataoffset)\r\n* [`HttpClientFactory` no longer logs header values by default](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#httpclientfactory-no-longer-logs-header-values-by-default)\r\n* [Out-of-proc Meter wildcard listening](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#Out-of-proc-Meter-wildcard-listening)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md)\r\n\r\n## **üõ†Ô∏è SDK**\r\n\r\n* [Workload History](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/sdk.md#workload-history)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/sdk.md)\r\n\r\n## **üåê ASP.NET Core**\r\n\r\n* [Improvements to SignalR distributed tracing](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#improvements-to-signalr-distributed-tracing)\r\n* [Keep-alive timeout for WebSockets](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#keep-alive-timeout-for-websockets)\r\n* [Keyed DI in middleware](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#keyed-di-in-middleware)\r\n* [Override `InputNumber` type attribute](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#override-inputnumber-type-attribute)\r\n* [Trust the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate on Linux](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#trust-the-aspnet-core-https-development-certificate-on-linux)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md)\r\n\r\n## **üì± .NET MAUI**\r\n\r\n* [Added `HorizontalTextAlignment.Justify`](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/dotnetmaui.md#added-horizontaltextalignmentjustify)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/dotnetmaui.md)\r\n\r\n## Get started\r\n\r\nTo get started with .NET 9, [install the .NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0).\r\n\r\nIf you're on Windows using Visual Studio, we recommend installing the latest [Visual Studio 2022 preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/). .NET 9 is now can be installed directly through the Visual Studio installer starting with Visual Studio 2022 17.12 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nYou can also use Visual Studio Code and the [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) extension with .NET 9.\r\n\r\nYou can find [.NET 9 RC 1 Installer & Binaries](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/9.0.0-rc.1.md) on GitHub.\r\n\r\n## Team Announcements & Discussions\r\n\r\nDiscuss this release with the product teams on GitHub through the announcements for this release.\r\n\r\n* [.NET MAUI](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/discussions/24698)\r\n* ASP.NET Core(https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/discussions/57787)\r\n\r\n## Stay up-to-date with .NET 9\r\n\r\nYou can stay up-to-date with all the features of .NET 9 with:\r\n\r\n* [What's new in .NET 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-9/overview)\r\n* [What's new in ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/release-notes/aspnetcore-9.0)\r\n* [What's new in .NET MAUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/whats-new/dotnet-9)\r\n* [What's new in EF Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew)\r\n* [Breaking Changes in .NET 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/compatibility/9.0)\r\n* [.NET 9 Releases](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/README.md)\r\n\r\nFor .NET 9 previews we are utilizing GitHub Discussions to make announcements.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nWe [announced Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-the-new-microsoftdatasqlclient/) in the first half of 2019 and [shipped the first stable](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-blog/released-general-availability-of-microsoft-data-sqlclient-1-0/ba-p/825859) package later that year. That release [coincided with .NET Core 3.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-0/#introducing-the-new-sqlclient). We‚Äôve been developing [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient) in the [dotnet/SqlClient](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient) repo since that time, over the last five years. It‚Äôs now time to start the deprecation process for the [System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient) package. We plan to take a staged process to deprecation, with the intent to align support changes and associated code transition activities between these libraries to natural migration points between .NET major versions.\r\n\r\nAll System.Data.SqlClient users are encouraged to transition to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. We offer improvements and significantly higher support via the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nWe intend to deprecate the System.Data.SqlClient package in stages.\r\n- **Before .NET 9 GA:**\r\n  - Publish a new 5.0.0 package, including the following changes.\r\n  - Remove support for .NET 7 and earlier and .NET Framework 4.6.1 and earlier.\r\n  - Publish assets for the following target frameworks: .NET 8, .NET Framework 4.6.2, .NET Standard 2.0.\r\n  - Add [Obsolete attributes](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/attributes/general#obsolete-attribute) to .NET 8 and .NET Standard 2.0 assets. This will generate new warnings for .NET 8+ and .NET Standard users.\r\n  - Continue to offer security servicing, for .NET 8, and .NET Framework 4.6.2+ application users.\r\n- **After .NET 9 GA:**\r\n  - No change\r\n  - We will not support this package for .NET 9+ application users.\r\n- **After .NET 8 EOL:**\r\n  - Remove support for .NET 8 users (the .NET 8 library will be removed).\r\n  - Maintain support for .NET Framework 4.6.2+ users.\r\n  - Security servicing will be provided via .NET Framework, not the package, at that point.\r\n  - We do not expect to update the package again after this point.\r\n  - We will not mark the package as deprecated since it will only support .NET Framework users with an implementation provided by .NET Framework.\r\n\r\nWe will remove support in the package for unsupported .NET and .NET Framework versions at various stages of this deprecation plan. Users affected by those changes are encouraged to move to a supported .NET or .NET Framework version and to adopt the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package.\r\n\r\nWe decided to remove support for .NET 6 since it will go EOL shortly after this new package is released, even though .NET 6 will still be supported at the time. Publishing a .NET 8 library significantly simplifies the plan, both in terms of what we will deliver and what we need to explain.\r\n\r\nFor .NET dates, see [.NET Releases.](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md) .NET 9 will [GA in November](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md) of this year. .NET 8 will go EOL in November, 2026.\r\n\r\nThe current package version of [System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient) is 4.8.6, at the time of writing. These changes will be made with a 5.0.0 version and later.\r\n\r\n**Note:** _This deprecation doesn‚Äôt apply to the System.Data.SqlClient namespace in .NET Framework._\r\n\r\n### Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\r\n\r\nDaily downloads of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient on nuget.org are nearing 50% higher than System.Data.SqlClient. We expect the gap in usage between the two libraries will continue to increase. Microsoft.Data.SqlClient is the best library we offer to access SQL Server.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to providing high-quality, performance-driven, and secure data access technologies. We strongly encourage users to transition to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. It is actively maintained and supports the latest SQL Server features.\r\n\r\n### How to migrate? \r\n\r\nAdd the NuGet package to your project, then update your references and using statements. Our [porting cheat sheet](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/blob/master/porting-cheat-sheet.md) provides a step-by-step set of changes you may need to make.\r\n\r\n1. **Update your project references:** Replace references to System.Data.SqlClient with Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.\r\n2. **Modify your using statements:** Update your using statements in your code files from System.Data.SqlClient to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.\r\n3. **Test your application:** Thoroughly test your application to ensure that it works as expected after the migration.\r\n\r\nWe also plan to [support semi-automatic migration](https://github.com/dotnet/upgrade-assistant/issues/1593) via [.NET Upgrade Assistant](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/upgrade-assistant).\r\n\r\n**Support & Feedback:** If you have any questions or need assistance with the migration, please reach out through our [official support channels](https://support.microsoft.com/) or join the discussion on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues).\r\n\r\n**Resources**\r\n- [Frequently Asked Questions - dotnet/SqlClient Wiki - GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions)\r\n- [Introduction to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient namespace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/introduction-microsoft-data-sqlclient-namespace?view=sql-server-ver16)\r\n- [SQL Server and ADO.NET (Microsoft.Data.SqlClient)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/sql)\r\n- [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient API Browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/322","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Announcement: System.Data.SqlClient package is now deprecated\" (#322)"},{"Id":"2464032272","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-13T19:08:47","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"321","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 9 Preview 7","State":"open","Body":"We are pleased to announce the release of .NET 9 Preview 7.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nAs [announced earlier](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/293), starting with .NET 9, we no longer include an implementation of `BinaryFormatter` in the runtime (.NET Framework remains unchanged). The APIs are still present, but their implementation always throws an exception, regardless of project type. Hence, setting the existing backwards compatibility flag is no longer sufficient to use `BinaryFormatter`.\r\n\r\n* We published the [BinaryFormatter migration guide][migration-guide]. We'd appreciate if could give it a read and give us feedback by filling issues in the [dotnet/docs] repo.\r\n* If you experience issues related to BinaryFormatter's removal not addressed in this migration guide, please file an issue in the [dotnet/runtime][dotnet/runtime] repo and indicate that the issue is related to the removal of `BinaryFormatter`.\r\n\r\n### Why was it removed?\r\n\r\n*[Docs][security-guide]*\r\n\r\nThe primary reason is that BinaryFormatter is unsafe. Any deserializer, binary or text, that allows its input to carry information about the objects to be created is a security problem waiting to happen. There is a common weakness enumeration (CWE) that describes the issue: [CWE-502 \"Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"][CWE502]. `BinaryFormatter` is such a deserializer. We also cover this in the [BinaryFormatter security guide][security-guide].\r\n\r\n### What are my options to move forward?\r\n\r\n*[Docs][migration-guide]*\r\n\r\nYou have two options to address the removal of `BinaryFormatter`'s implementation:\r\n\r\n1. **Migrate away from BinaryFormatter**. We strongly recommend you to investigate options to stop using `BinaryFormatter` due to the associated security risks. The [BinaryFormatter migration guide][migration-guide] lists several options.\r\n\r\n2. **Keep using BinaryFormatter**. If you need to continue using `BinaryFormatter` in .NET 9, you need to depend on the unsupported [System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters][compat-pack] NuGet package, which restores the unsafe legacy functionality and replaces the throwing implementation.\r\n\r\n[compat-pack]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-migration-guide/compatibility-package\r\n[migration-guide]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-migration-guide/\r\n[security-guide]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-security-guide\r\n[CWE502]: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html\r\n[dotnet/docs]: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=01-general-issue.yml\r\n[dotnet/runtime]: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/new\r\n\r\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/106240.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\r\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n\r\n\r\n Version:   8.0.200\r\n Commit:    8473146e7d\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n\r\n  Version: 8.0.3\r\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n\r\n  8.0.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n\r\n  Microsoft.AspAspNetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspAspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.7  Runtime or .NET 8.0.107 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.8) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 6.0, you should download and install Runtime 6.0.32 or SDK 6.0.132 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0.\r\n\r\n.NET 6.0 and .NET 8.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update. To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty.

This transfer will also leverage Canonical expertise with Snap packaging and enhance the design of .NET Snaps for added improvements. Canonical is currently working on creating new .NET Snap packages.\r\n\r\nYou will continue to leverage Snaps to install/update .NET for all the supported .NET versions (currently include .NET 6, .NET 7, and .NET 8). Like the current state, you can use Snap to install .NET SDK and .NET Runtime.\r\n\r\n### Important Dates, Impact, and Call to Action\r\n\r\n1. The ownership transfer of the existing .NET Snaps from Microsoft to Canonical.\r\n\r\n   Date: May 2024 (_Stay tuned for exact date_)\r\n   Impact: No impact on .NET Snap user \r\n   Call to action: No action needed.\r\n\r\n2. Transition from the old Snap packages to the newly built Snaps by Canonical.\r\n\r\n    Impact:\r\n- New Snap will package Canonical-built .NET. As Canonical does not build/publish .2xx and higher SDK feature bands due to breaking changes, new Snap will only support .1xx SDK feature band for the lifetime of a major .NET version.\r\n- .NET previews (.NET 9 previews) will not be available to install via Snap.\r\n\r\n   _Stay tuned for date and call to action to switch from old to new .NET Snaps._\r\n\r\n### Issue Log\r\nAfter ownership is transferred from Microsoft to Canonical in May, log any .NET Snap issues to the dotnet-snap repository under the Canonical org [https://github.com/canonical/dotnet-snap](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcanonical%2Fdotnet-snap&data=05%7C02%7Cashitanagar%40microsoft.com%7Cc5b9b895923f4c11483908dc57efcb4c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638481934634983274%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=fvusMJ%2Fl94m3WaJvpM7kK85%2BzIXGLsenPt7BmKPtRSU%3D&reserved=0).\r\n\r\n### Important Links\r\n[.NET SDK Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/dotnet-sdk)\r\n[Canonical GitHub Repository](https://github.com/canonical/dotnet-snap)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/304","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Snap Ownership Transfer from Microsoft to Canonical\" (#304)"},{"Id":"2234072927","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-09T18:22:01","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"303","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-21409 | .NET Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-21409 | .NET Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 ,and .NET 8.0.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the MCU.  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.  Ratios greater than 1 mean the benchmark performed worse with the JCC microcode update applied.\r\n - Y: Count of benchmarks in the bucket.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210322/80840714-ba0bda80-8bb2-11ea-8869-07ec55182661.png)\r\n**While there are some outliers, for the most part, the benchmarks are clustered around a ratio of 1 with the most benchmarks in the 1.038 – 1.085 bucket, which represents single digit percentage degradation.**"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreCLR":{"Events":[{"Id":"12513205667","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-06-03T01:13:35","Actor":"AaronRobinsonMSFT","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28046","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Support function pointers in field marshalers\" (#28046) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/37295\r\n\r\nThis was fixed in .NET 5 when [field marshalling was completely rewritten](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/26340).\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nUsers will be unable to have function pointers as fields in structs.

This eliminates the need to keep the static constructor code around if the type was statically constructed at compile time.\r\n\r\nThis runs a small interpreter to interpret the static constructor at compile time.\r\n\r\n* Besides the easy things (preinitializing primitive-typed fields), this can also preinitialize reference types (classes, arrays). This builds on top of the GC's ability to deal with \"frozen objects\" (reference type instances allocated within the data section of the executable instead of on the GC heap). There's some limitations of course (e.g no finalizers - these never get garbage collected).\r\n* Can also do things like non-recursive inlining\r\n\r\nOf course there's limitations (the static constructor cannot have side effects, cannot do things like p/invoke, etc.), but it works pretty well.\r\n\r\nSome results:\r\n\r\n|                      | Types eligible for preinitialization | Types preinitialized |\r\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|\r\n| ASP.NET SampleWebApi | 1991                                 | 754                  |\r\n| Empty WinForms app   | 1510                                 | 709                  |\r\n| Console Hello world  | 317                                  | 149                  |\r\n\r\nAlso results in about 0.2% size on disk improvement, but size improvement is not really the point of this optimization.\r\n\r\nCurrent limitations that I want to lift eventually:\r\n* No backwards branches - to avoids jokers putting `while (true) ;` in a static constructors (we can put an upper limit on number of instructions interpreted instead)\r\n* Can't preinitialize delegates, but delegates to static methods should be doable and are pretty common in the ASP.NET codebase.\r\n* Can't access static fields of types other than the one being preinitialized.

[Function pointers](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/proposals/function-pointers.md) are now supported in the C# language.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nThis can naturally be worked around by using `IntPtr`, `UIntPtr`, `void*`, `nint`, or `nuint` as the field and then casting to the appropriate function pointer type at the usage site in managed code. This would severely degrade the UX for usage of function pointers though.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nNo. This is supporting a new C# feature and previous .NET runtimes never tested/supported this scenario.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nValidated both 32 and 64 bit struct of the field marshalling scenario. This follows the same behavior as a `void*` pointer so no new functionality is added just reuse of an existing code path for a new type.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\nLow. \r\n\r\n/cc @tannergooding @333fred @jkoritzinsky @jkotas ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28046","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Support function pointers in field marshalers\" (#28046)"},{"Id":"629345338","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-02T16:32:12","Actor":"omajid","Number":"28045","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/2.1] Fix build with clang 10","State":"open","Body":"This contains a grab bag of fixes to fix the build with clang 10.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/23075\r\n\r\n  Fix missing includes in coreclr/src/debug/createdump/\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/33096\r\n\r\n  SList::Init: add missing constructor\r\n\r\n- A subset of https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/22129\r\n\r\n  Just the parts that introduce the THROW_DECL macro in pal.h\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/32837\r\n\r\n  This fixes THROW_DECL introduce in the previous PR to work with clang, which\r\n  is required in clang 10.\r\n\r\n- One new change:\r\n\r\n  In a significant divergance, this commits adds more THROW_DECL macros\r\n  to all the math functions to address a ton of errors pointed out when\r\n  building SOS:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n    In file included from /home/omajid/devel/dotnet/coreclr/src/ToolBox/SOS/Strike/strike.cpp:116:\r\n    In file included from /home/omajid/devel/dotnet/coreclr/src/vm/hillclimbing.h:19:\r\n    In file included from /home/omajid/devel/dotnet/coreclr/src/inc/complex.h:16:\r\n    In file included from /usr/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/10/../../../../include/c++/10/math.h:36:\r\n    In file included from /usr/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/10/../../../../include/c++/10/cmath:45:\r\n    In file included from /usr/include/math.h:290:\r\n    /usr/include/bits/mathcalls.h:53:13: error: exception specification in declaration does not match previous declaration\r\n    __MATHCALL (acos,, (_Mdouble_ __x));\r\n                ^\r\n    /home/omajid/devel/dotnet/coreclr/src/pal/inc/pal.h:4395:26: note: previous declaration is here\r\n    PALIMPORT double __cdecl acos(double);\r\n                             ^\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n  Then, to make sure the declarations and implementations match, it adds\r\n  THROW_DECL to the definitions in src/pal/src/cruntime/math.cpp\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Mike McLaughlin <mikem@microsoft.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Sinan Kaya <sinan.kaya@microsoft.com>\r\nCo-authored-by: Tom Deseyn <tom.deseyn@gmail.com>","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28045","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/2.1] Fix build with clang 10\" (#28045)"},{"Id":"622546826","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-21T14:41:29","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"28044","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix triggers for 3.1","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28044","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/3.1] Fix triggers for 3.1\" (#28044)"},{"Id":"622076092","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-20T20:55:40","Actor":"Anipik","Number":"28043","RawContent":null,"Title":"update branding to 2.2.11","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28043","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"update branding to 2.2.11\" (#28043)"},{"Id":"622026514","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-20T19:37:48","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"28042","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/2.1' => 'release/uwp6.2'","State":"closed","Body":"I detected changes in the release/2.1 branch which have not been merged yet to release/uwp6.2.

A usage pattern that worsens this leak is to start tracing, fill up all the buffers, then stop tracing, and repeat that many times. This fix mitigates the issue by making EventPipeBuffer to use ClrVirtualAlloc instead of malloc.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\nOn Linux platforms (specifically ones that use glibc), customers may see an unexpected growth in the native heap size over a long period of time if using EventPipe for a long time (ex. using Application Insights Service Profiler), making our first-party and third-party tracing solutions potentially problematic in production scenarios when used for elongated periods of time.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\nNo, EventPipe buffers were always allocated using malloc.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nThe fix was tested against the scenario the customer provided and .

The implicit ref is removed in either of these cases:\r\n      - The mutex gets another reference from within the same process\r\n      - The thread that owns the lock exits and abandons the mutex, at which point that would be the last reference to the mutex and the process would not reference the mutex anymore\r\n  - The implementation based on file locks is less restricted, but for consistency that implementation also follows the same behavior\r\n- There was also a race between an exiting thread abandoning one of its locked named mutexes and another thread releasing the last reference to it, fixed by using the creation/deletion process lock to synchronize\r\n\r\nFix for https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/34271 in 3.1\r\n\r\n### Customer impact\r\n\r\n- Random crashes were seen on Unixes\r\n- When a named mutex is locked and the last reference to it is released from a different thread in any process, the underlying pthread mutex object is destroyed and that has undefined behavior.

The original code was a minimal implementation which only covered the instruction form historically used by the JIT.  As new forms and especially intrinsics were added, the code was not updated because the complexity was far too high. \r\n\r\nWe completely missed decode of all x64 simd instruction forms.\r\n\r\nThe fix required was this substantial change.

That frees the handle, but leaves it on the cleanup\r\nlist of the loader allocator. The same handle can be later allocated for\r\nsome\r\nother purpose. When the AssemblyLoaderAllocator is being destroyed, all\r\nthe handles on the cleanup list are destroyed too. So it destroys also\r\nthe handle that was left on the cleanup list incorrectly. That can cause\r\nall kinds of hard to diagnose issues, like the\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/32171.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes it by adding a FreeGCHandle method on the\r\nRuntimeTypeHandle that besides freeing the handle also removes it from\r\nthe cleanup list of the related AssemblyLoadContext.\r\n\r\n ## Customer impact\r\nHard to diagnose crashes in the runtime caused by closing of random\r\nGC handles.

In 2.1 and 2.2, the thread that loses\r\nthe race destroys the handle only if the type was not in a collectible\r\nassembly. Since the non-collectible assemblies LoaderAllocator is never\r\ndestroyed, the handles were never cleaned up and so no problem could occur.\r\nIt was introduced in https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/21737\r\n\r\n ## Testing\r\nCustomer affected by the issue heavily has tested a fixed version and\r\nreported the issue doesn't occur anymore.\r\n\r\n ## Risk\r\nLow, the new code is executed at single place once per process runtine\r\nonly when a thread races for allocating the GC handle with another one\r\nand loses the race.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28025","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Port to 3.1: Fix allocation of RuntimeTypeCache GC handle\" (#28025)"},{"Id":"569148773","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-25T20:35:59","Actor":"hoyosjs","Number":"28023","RawContent":null,"Title":"[3.1 port] Fix debugger crash during unload of assemblies in ALC","State":"closed","Body":"Issue dotnet/runtime#2317 reports that trying to use unloadable ALCs under the debugger often ends up in a crash.

This may cause compatibility issues as developers are porting from other platforms to macOS.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nContains unit tests for all but the basic constraints scenario due to missing functionality in release 2.1 to aid testing. All are tested in dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n**Low.**  All of the new codes have been encountered in testing and measured against Windows for cross-platform consistency.  The existing tests ensure that the change isn't accidentally doing subtle remaps of established values.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42916","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/2.1] Handle additional chain statuses for X509Chain on macOS\" (#42916)"},{"Id":"607782633","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-27T20:10:29","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"42913","RawContent":null,"Title":"Produce stable builds of System.Net.Http.Json","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42913","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Produce stable builds of System.Net.Http.Json\" (#42913)"},{"Id":"605904437","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-24T17:27:45","Actor":"joperezr","Number":"42911","RawContent":null,"Title":"Making System.Net.Http.Json to depend on inbox version of System.Net.Http for net461","State":"closed","Body":"cc: @ericstj \r\n\r\nAs expected, System.Net.Http.Json net461 configuration incorrectly depends on System.Net.Http.dll version 4.2.0.0.

It is adding .NET Framework configurations to our OOB packages so that they won't require netsandard shims for projects ingesting them and targeting .NET Framework.\r\n\r\nThings that need to happen before merging this PR:\r\n\r\n- [X] Add Net461 configurations to all projects that today ship as NuGet packages and have a .NET Standard asset when consumer targets .NET Framework 4.6.1/4.6.2/4.7/4.7.1/4.7.2/4.8. (This will be done with the first commit, so that it is easier to review this commit by commit.)\r\n- [X] Add Net461 configuration to OpenSSL OOB package which also needs it, but it will be treated specially given that it requires some special types in S.S.C.Algorithms that are not present in 461. (Done with commit 10df782)\r\n- [x] Baseline all of the packages that have new configurations from steps 1 and 2, and now service all packages above that depend on them so that all new package versions will depend on these new packages that have the new configs. After doing this, all of our latest NuGet packages should not require the .NET Standard shims. (Done with 14b5db5)\r\n- [x] Do some extensive testing to make sure API wasn't regressed by adding these new configurations. (I have more info on how I did this here https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42901#issuecomment-611770142).\r\n\r\n**Customer Impact**\r\n\r\nCustomers that have hit problems caused by this issue have been trying to add manual workarounds on their projects and custom logic for deploying. Once this is fixed, customers will have to remove those workarounds from their projects and reference the new packages in order to get the benefits of not needing the extra facades or binding redirects for their application.\r\n\r\n**Regression?**\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n**Packaging reviewed?**\r\n\r\nIt will involve packaging changes, so it will require a review by packaging experts.\r\n\r\n**Risk**\r\n\r\nLow. We didn't increase Assembly Version in order to not require new binding redirects from apps. The risk here is that we are effectively causing NuGet to use a different asset from the package to pass to the compiler and a different one as well for the implementation, but we did extensive testing to ensure that we were not removing or adding API and that there was no visible difference between the assets that they used to get and the ones they will get now.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42901","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Adding .NET Framework configurations to OOB packages so that they won't require the netstandard shims when targeting .NET Framework\" (#42901)"},{"Id":"599126181","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-13T21:23:23","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"42903","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update BuildTools to rc1-05113-01 (release/2.1)","State":"closed","Body":"/cc @dotnet/maestro-reviewers-core","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42903","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update BuildTools to rc1-05113-01 (release/2.1)\" (#42903)"},{"Id":"597967932","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-10T20:32:09","Actor":"pranavkm","Number":"42902","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to preview5","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42902","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to preview5\" (#42902)"},{"Id":"591386734","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-31T22:29:33","Actor":"Anipik","Number":"42899","RawContent":null,"Title":"Stablise the 3.1 branch","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42899","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Stablise the 3.1 branch\" (#42899)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Roslyn-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"629699843","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-03T05:19:07","Actor":"Cosifne","Number":"44814","RawContent":null,"Title":"Rename the Unit Testing side Json","State":"open","Body":"Address this [issue](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/42582) for unit testing.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/44814","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Rename the Unit Testing side Json\" (#44814)"},{"Id":"629689939","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-03T04:51:49","Actor":"wangluochao902","Number":"44813","RawContent":null,"Title":"A bug in Dockerfile","State":"open","Body":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/1b75734dee6db086b7705ae37a9035b79232bbb8/eng/docker/Mono/Dockerfile#L21\r\nHi, we are developing a tool to detect typos/bugs in dockerfiles automatically.

CompilationOptions.SpecificDiagnosticOptions (populated from command line `/nowarn`, `/warnaserror` and ruleset files)\r\n2. Editoconfig files\r\n3. Global analyzer config files\r\n\r\nWhen there are entries for the same diagnostic ID from multiple sources, following precedence order is followed today:\r\n\r\n1. Editorconfig wins over the other two.\r\n2. Global analyzer config diagnostic severity setting wins over SpecificDiagnosticOptions.\r\n\r\nThis has led to following 2 core issues:\r\n1. Given that global analyzer config files will invariably come from tooling/NuGet packages, it seems wrong for the settings from them to override the user provided command line SpecificDiagnosticOptions. I think we need to implemented Andy's suggestion in https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/37876#issuecomment-635493331 to address this. This would also lead to some work on the IDE side. For example, all places where we read the ruleset file to generate SpecificDiagnosticOptions would need to now read global analyzer config files (for example [here](http://sourceroslyn.io/#Microsoft.VisualStudio.LanguageServices/Implementation/ProjectSystem/RuleSets/IRuleSetFile.cs,afd4c39b90e560c1,references)). I think we need to do this change soon, otherwise it would become a breaking change in future.\r\n\r\n2. https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/43051 shows a side effect of editorconfig settings winning over command line SpecificDiagnosticOptions causing TreatWarningsAsErrors to not work as user expected. Changing this now would likely be a big breaking change, and defeat the original purpose of allowing per-file or directory overrides to project level diagnostic configuration. Do we have any alternatives/workarounds here which can help users?\r\n\r\nI think we need to make a final call on the precedence order and call out the supported scenarios and recommended workarounds where required.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/44804","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Precedence of diagnostic severity settings from compilation options, editorconfig and global analyzerconfig\" (#44804)"},{"Id":"629475312","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-02T22:08:42","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"44798","RawContent":null,"Title":"Only offer 'Use coalesce expression' in C#8 and above.","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/44793","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/44798","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Only offer 'Use coalesce expression' in C#8 and above.\" (#44798)"},{"Id":"629423123","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-02T22:08:42","Actor":"jnm2","Number":"44793","RawContent":null,"Title":"IDE0074 'Use compound assignment' should not be offered for pre-8.0 language versions","State":"closed","Body":"**Version Used**: 16.6.0, 16.6.1, 16.7-p1\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nclass C\r\n{\r\n    void M(object p)\r\n    {\r\n        // ℹ IDE0074 Use compound assignment\r\n        //    ↓↓\r\n        _ = p ??

This causes a code that doesn't make any sense to compile. Also whether the code compiles or not seem to depend on compiler heuristics and result in a very undersiable state. <br><br>Let's have a C# class library:</p><pre>namespace CSharpLibrary\n{\n    public struct Dummy\n    {\n        public Dummy(string value)\n        {\n            Value = value;\n        }\n\npublic string Value { get; }\n    }\n}\n</pre><p><br><br>And let's have a C# application using the above class library:\n</p><pre>using System;\nusing CSharpLibrary;\n\nnamespace CSharpApp\n{\n    class Program\n    {\n        static void Main(string[] args)\n        {\n            switch (true)\n            {\n                case false:\n                    var dummy = new Dummy(&quot;foobar&quot;);\n                    break;\n                case true:\n                    Console.WriteLine($&quot;dummy. Value='{dummy. Value}'&quot;);\n                    break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n</pre><p></p><p>The code compiles, the <code>dummy</code> variable is defined as a local with the scope of the entire function in the IL, so the <code>case true:</code>  is able to use the default initialised variable, and it prints out </p><pre>dummy. Value=''\n</pre><p><br>See the attachment for easy repro: <a href=\"https://developercommunityapi.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/storage/attachments/123071-uninitializedvariabledetectionbugrepro.zip\">uninitializedvariabledetectionbugrepro.zip</a><br><br>However if you change <code>Dummy</code> to contain an integer instead of a string, you get the correct compile error. If you define <code>Dummy</code> inside the CSharpApp, instead of in the library you also get the correct behaviour. Using binary dependency instead of source dependency seems to cause a change in some cases whether the compile error appears or not, but not for this particular example code. In some cases Roselyn and msbuild disagree, a code compiles with one, but not the other. <br><br>I've tried this with multiple versions of .NET Framework and .NET Core, the behaviour seems uniform across all those.</p>\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Visual Studio Feedback System on 3/16/2020, 00:25 AM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

If you look at the code below in the TestClass constructor the Console.WriteLine method will throw a NullReferenceException because this.Value is null and hasn't been assigned yet. There are no warnings or errors from VS though, it thinks everything is fine here. Am I missing something, shouldn't VS be warning about this? The value is definitely null here.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability which exists when .NET Core improperly handles web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against a .NET Core web application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.\r\n\r\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the .NET Core application.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the .NET Core web application handles web requests.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/36313\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\n* Any .NET Core 2.1 application running on .NET Core 2.1.17 or lower\r\n* Any .NET Core 3.1 application running on .NET Core 3.1.3 or lower\r\n* Any .NET 5 application running on .NET 5 Preview 3 or lower\r\n\r\nPlease note that .NET Core 3.0 is now out of support and all applications should be updated to 3.1.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in [affected software](#affected-software) you are exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET Core. If you have multiple versions of .NET Core installed you will need to install multiple runtimes, or SDKs depending on what you have installed. If you have installed one or more .NET Core SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio which will also update your .NET Core SDKs.\r\n\r\nYou can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.1 you should download and install Runtime 2.1.18 or SDK 2.1.514 (for Visual Studio 2017 v15.9), 2.1.611 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.0) or 2.1.806 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.2 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.1 you should download and install Runtime 3.1.4 or SDK 3.1.104 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.4) or 3.1.202 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.5 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1\r\n* For machines running .NET 5 Preview you should download and install .NET 5 Preview 4 when available from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple affected versions you must update the runtime or SDKs for each version.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the .NET Core Bug Bounty.

The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.  Ratios greater than 1 mean the benchmark performed worse with the JCC microcode update applied.\r\n - Y: Count of benchmarks in the bucket.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210322/80840714-ba0bda80-8bb2-11ea-8869-07ec55182661.png)\r\n**While there are some outliers, for the most part, the benchmarks are clustered around a ratio of 1 with the most benchmarks in the 1.038 – 1.085 bucket, which represents single digit percentage degradation.**","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\" (#153)"},{"Id":"583170428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-17T17:16:09","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"152","RawContent":null,"Title":"March 2020 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on March 2020.

This means [.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) is no longer supported and updates will no longer be provided. We recommend moving to [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/), our long term support (LTS) release.\r\n\r\n- [Download .NET Core 3.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n- [.NET Core 2.2 end-of-life statement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-2-2-will-reach-end-of-life-on-december-23-2019/)\r\n\r\nWe've created an issue at [dotnet/core#4084](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/4084) for your questions and comments.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Lifecycle\r\n\r\n.NET Core releases belong to one of two [support lifecycles](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy): long term support (LTS) and Current. LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files. But now you can enhance your localized Visual Studio development experience by adding the localized IntelliSense files from the download site into your local development environment.\r\n\r\nLastly, with this release we have made the localized IntelliSense available as zip archives that does require you to manually extract and copy the files to respective SDK install folders.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

Our planning has reached a point where we have a schedule for the coreclr, corefx and core-setupmoves into dotnet/runtime that we want to share out with the community.\r\n\r\n### November 13th\r\nWe’ll move all changes from the original repositories into dotnet/runtime up to 5PM PST on November 13th. We’ll try to help as many pull requests as possible get merged by then. At that point, if there’s any pull requests still open we’ll have to close them. If you’d still like to continue those pull requests, we’d encourage you to bring them to dotnet/runtime in a new pull request.\r\n\r\nThe repositories themselves will be effectively archived at this point. The state of the “master” branch will be recorded with a tag, named “master-archive”, but the branch itself will be deleted. The default branch for the repositories will be named “archive” and it will be a single commit with a README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md file pointing to our dotnet/runtime repository.\r\n\r\nThe repositories will remain active for servicing changes to .NET Core 3.1 and earlier hence we will not be using the GitHub archive capability. \r\n\r\n### November 22nd\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be made public and available for community contribution. Even though the repository will be created on November 13th it will take several days to get it back into a working order: fixing up our build scripts, recreating our Azure Dev Ops build definitions, etc … Until those tasks are completed it will not be possible to accept pull request and hence the repository will remain private. Once we are in a state that pull requests can be merged again the repository will be made public.\r\n\r\nOur expectation is that will occur on November 22nd. If it is ready sooner it will be made public sooner. If the work takes longer than we planned then we will add an update to this announcement with a new expected date.\r\n\r\n### December 1st-2nd\r\nAll issues, open and closed, will be migrated from corefx, coreclr and core-setup into dotnet/runtime. This will be using GitHub’s existing issue transfer feature in a bulk migration. This means all of the existing issue links will continue to function via redirects.\r\n\r\nThis does mean though that labels will not transfer with the issues. Labels will be re-applied as a post processing step by our engineering team once the issue migration completes.\r\n\r\nEven though our issues won’t be fully migrated until this time we’d like the community to begin filing issues on dotnet/runtime as soon as it’s public rather than continuing to file issues on the original repositories.\r\n\r\n### Migrating Commits\r\nThe dotnet/runtime repository will be a new commit history from the original repositories. We are using this consolidation as an opportunity to clean up our history with the goal of having a cleaner, smaller history as a starting point. This means commits will be rewritten in the following ways as they are migrated to dotnet/runtime:\r\n\r\n1. Author information, contributor information, changed file list and time stamps from the original commit will be preserved.\r\n1. Links to issues, pull requests or commits in the repository using GitHub short links will be rewritten so they continue to point the original repository. \r\n1. Every commit will be appended with a link to the original commit it was mapped from.\r\n\r\nThe actual contents of the commit though will be updated to match the new directory layout of the dotnet/runtime repository.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/133","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Repository Consolidation Timeline\" (#133)"},{"Id":"513963125","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-10-29T14:32:55","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"132","RawContent":null,"Title":"Release of Alpine 3.10 Docker images","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core Alpine Docker images updated to Alpine 3.10\r\n\r\nDocker images for .NET Core have been released that support Alpine 3.10.

With [.NET Standard 2.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-standard-2-0/), we tried to make it much more viable to share code between .NET Framework, .NET Core, and Xamarin which resulted in approximately 38K .NET Frameworks APIs being available in .NET Core 2.0. We also built the [Windows Compatibility Pack](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/) which made another 21K .NET Framework APIs available to .NET Core, resulting in almost 60K additional APIs. And in .NET Core 3.0 we added WPF and WinForms, which increased the number of .NET Framework APIs ported to .NET Core to over 120k, which is more than half of all .NET Framework APIs.\r\n\r\nIt’s also worth pointing out that we added about 62K APIs to .NET Core that don’t exist in .NET Framework. If we compare their total number of APIs, .NET Core has about 80% of the API surface of .NET Framework.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/66777114-f8db7c80-ee7c-11e9-9161-acfe1c491586.png\" width=\"600\" align=\"center\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nWe announced that the [future of .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-is-the-future-of-net/) will be based on .NET Core. And at Build 2019, [Scott Hunter stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlO1utbB2GQ&t=54m20s) that AppDomains, remoting, Web Forms, WCF server, and Windows Workflow won’t be ported to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nWith .NET Core 3.0, we’re at the point where we’ve ported all technologies that are required for modern workloads, be that desktop apps, mobile apps, console apps, web sites, or cloud services. That’s not to say that we don’t have any gaps or opportunities for new technologies, but we generally believe we won’t be finding them in the .NET Framework code base anymore. Moving forward, we’re focusing our resources on incorporating new technologies.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, we’re looking into releasing more of the [.NET Framework code base under the MIT license](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource) on GitHub to allow the community to create OSS projects for technologies we’re not intending to bring to .NET Core. For example, there already are community projects for [CoreWF](https://github.com/UiPath/corewf) and [CoreWCF](https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF).\r\n\r\nWe’d like to thank everyone who filed issues with requests for APIs being ported.

While this is still work in progress, we'd like to give you an update on where we are.\r\n\r\nSo far, we've identified the following repos:\r\n\r\n* dotnet/**runtime**\r\n\t- Will contain [coreclr](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr), [corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx), [core-setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup), [aspnet/Extensions](https://github.com/aspnet/Extensions), and some of [mono/mono](https://github.com/mono/mono)\r\n* [dotnet/**sdk**](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk)\r\n\t- Will contain [toolset](https://github.com/dotnet/toolset), [sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk), [cli](https://github.com/dotnet/cli)\r\n* dotnet/**installer**\r\n\t- Renamed from [core-sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/core-sdk)\r\n* dotnet/**aspnetcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) and will also contain [aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore-Tooling)\r\n* dotnet/**efcore**\r\n\t- Moved from [aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore)\r\n* [dotnet/**winforms**](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity \r\n* [dotnet/**wpf**](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf)\r\n\t- Unchanged, but listed for clarity\r\n\r\n### Name changes\r\n\r\nYou might notice that we changed our mind on naming from our [earlier announcement][ann]. Based on your feedback, we decided to go with **dotnet/runtime** instead of **dotnet/platform** and **dotnet/sdk** instead of **dotnet/cli**.\r\n\r\nSeveral people pointed out that the previous names weren't relatable to how we talk about the product, for example on download pages. So, we decided to match the product distributions as the primary design point for the new names. We generally refer to the bits you need to run your app as *the runtime* and the bits you need to build apps as *the SDK*. This also matches the naming chosen by other platforms.\r\n\r\n### New repos can't be used for .NET Core 3.x or earlier\r\n\r\nThe consolidated repositories are going to be about .NET 5 and going forward. It will not be possible to build .NET Core 3.1 or earlier from these repositories. As such, only the master branch from each of the repositories will be brought forward. There will be no porting of the individual release branches in the source repositories.\r\n\r\n### Personal names and email addresses\r\n\r\nSince we're planning on rebasing the history in the merged repositories, we can map your name and email address to new values as well. We primarily do this to support our friends in the LGBTQ+ community who have changed their names to reflect their identities. However, anybody is welcome to use this to change their email and name.\r\n\r\nWhatever your reason might be: we value your contributions and we hope this small gesture makes your life a little bit better. So if you changed your name/email – or simply prefer us to use different values – please [submit a request](mailto:dotnet@microsoft.com&subject=.NET%20repo%20consolidation%3A%20request%20for%20name%20change&body=Hey%2C%20%0A%0AI%E2%80%99d%20like%20to%20change%20my%20email%2Fdisplay%20name%20in%20the%20consolidated%20repo%20from%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20Old%20Name%20%3Cold.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0Ato%20%0A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20My%20New%20Name%20%3Cnew.me%40example.org%3E%20%0A%0AThanks%21%20%0A).\r\n\r\n### More is coming\r\n\r\nWe'll share more updates in the upcoming months.

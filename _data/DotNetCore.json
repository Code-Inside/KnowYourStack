All new repos will already use this naming. Over the next couple of months, we're going to rename the branches in our existing repos as well. We're using [GitHub's new tooling](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-01-19-support-for-renaming-an-existing-branch/) to make sure branch policies and PRs are automatically updated.\r\n\r\nHowever, this still requires some changes from you as well. This announcement describes the process and what you need to do on your end.\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a smaller list of repos and grow from there. Theses are the planned starting repos:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/project-system](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system)\r\n* [dotnet/llvm-project](https://github.com/dotnet/llvm-project)\r\n* [dotnet/icu](https://github.com/dotnet/icu)\r\n* [dotnet/xharness](https://github.com/dotnet/xharness)\r\n* [mono/linker](https://github.com/mono/linker)\r\n* [dotnet/docker-tools](https://github.com/dotnet/docker-tools)\r\n* [dotnet/wcf](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf)\r\n* [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore)\r\n\r\nWe're starting with a smaller list to ensure we catch all cases where need to update corresponding configuration in our Arcade-based tooling (see [this fantastic blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/) on how we build .NET).\r\n\r\nOnce we have validated our checklist, each repo admin will rename the default branch at their own pace. We expect to complete all repos in the next couple of months.\r\n\r\n## What you can expect\r\n\r\n*We have a detailed guide you can find at <https://aka.ms/m2m-dotnet>. This is only the essentials.*\r\n\r\nWe'll add a sticky issue to each repo when we're about to rename the branch. We'll do this a few days before and we'll leave it there for two weeks.\r\n\r\n**You don't need to update your PRs**. If you submitted a PR against the old default branch, the GitHub tooling will automatically retarget your PR against the new default branch (main).\r\n\r\nFor sanity, **you should rename the default branch in your fork as well**.

Particularly `_EH_prolog3_catch_GS_align`/`_EH_epilog3_GS_align` had a `mov esp, ebx` instruction the lazy unwinding didn't handle. This helper ended up getting called by 3 FCalls in all coreclr: \r\n\r\n- `DebugDebugger::Log`\r\n- `StubHelpers::ValidateObjec`\r\n- `COMDelegate::BindToMethodName`\r\n\r\n# Customer Impact\r\n\r\nCustomers will see seeing seemingly random behavior once one of these stubs is hit. This manifests as GC holes where the stack walking caused the GC to not find stack roots, effectively unrooting object with references in the stack. A customer reported this from their use of `Debug.WriteLine` .\r\n\r\n# Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, with respect to previous releases. The regression was caused by a native toolset update in the build agents.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\nA repro app that used to crash in under a second using GC stress ran successfully for 12+hrs with no issues. \r\n\r\n# Risk\r\n\r\nVery targeted fix, both @jkotas and I have stepped through the unwinder logic and it's as minimally invasive as possible while preserving correctness.

Previously we had two separate passes: syntactic (top-level and statement level) and semantic. If a rude edit was found during the first one we did not run the second one. The whole analysis was entirely based on the document content except for constructor semantic analysis, which could use semantic information from other documents. The new approach performs top-level only syntactic analysis and then feeds the top-level edits directly into semantic analysis. The semantic analysis translates the syntactic edits to symbol edits and if performs statement level syntactic and semantic analysis for members with updated bodies. This allows us to compare member bodies across documents - since we can run the body analysis not only on bodies located in the document being analyzed but also bodies retrieved from the syntax references of symbols.\r\n\r\nThe new approach requires the semantic and member body analysis to be more robust and handle semantically incorrect code since we no can no longer discover many of the rude edits in the first phase (top-level) and bail. E.g. the first phase can't distinguish between a deleted member declaration and a member declaration moved to another file.\r\n\r\nSome edits in partial classes require additional post-processing. E.g. if field initializers of a partial type located in different documents are updated the resulting semantic edit should be a single edit of each of the constructors that emits these initializers. Since we still perform and store the results of the analysis per document (for each changed document) we'll end up with the constructor updates recorded for each document. The final results must merge these results before passing it to the compiler when emitting deltas.\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/50016\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/32494\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/51177\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/50876\r\n\r\nFollow-ups/potential improvements:\r\n- [ ] It is possible to emit invalid delta if semantic info is inferred from documents that are not up to date (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/51261)\r\n- [ ] member moves across partial definitions might be classified as renamed and not handled correctly (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/51011)\r\n- [ ] Support moving member containing an active statement to a different file (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/51177)\r\n- [ ] Adding a constructor to a type with field/property initializers that contain lambdas (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/2504)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreRT":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"SDK":{"Events":[{"Id":"15279489319","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-02-23T04:07:05","Actor":"captainsafia","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/15998","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Fix EmitCompilerGeneratedFiles property in compilation\" (#15998) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"Addresses https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/30302."},{"Id":"15279375404","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-02-23T03:49:30","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/16010","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/aspnetcore\" (#16010) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:c0c2be01-34a3-46d9-31fe-08d7a4f3bc87)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore\r\n- **Subscription**: c0c2be01-34a3-46d9-31fe-08d7a4f3bc87\r\n- **Build**: 20210222.16\r\n- **Date Produced**: 2/23/2021 1:27 AM\r\n- **Commit**: c7fe5c6ccd40aadd18fddd7fb8f21376605bc389\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

Fix lazy machine state unwinding for MSVC epilogues on x86","State":"open","Body":"# Description\r\n\r\nMSVC introduced changes into their prologue/epilogue helpers. Particularly `_EH_prolog3_catch_GS_align`/`_EH_epilog3_GS_align` had a `mov esp, ebx` instruction the lazy unwinding didn't handle. This helper ended up getting called by 3 FCalls in all coreclr: \r\n\r\n- `DebugDebugger::Log`\r\n- `StubHelpers::ValidateObjec`\r\n- `COMDelegate::BindToMethodName`\r\n\r\n# Customer Impact\r\n\r\nCustomers will see seeing seemingly random behavior once one of these stubs is hit. This manifests as GC holes where the stack walking caused the GC to not find stack roots, effectively unrooting object with references in the stack. A customer reported this from their use of `Debug.WriteLine` .\r\n\r\n# Regression?\r\n\r\nYes, with respect to previous releases. The regression was caused by a native toolset update in the build agents.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\nA repro app that used to crash in under a second using GC stress ran successfully for 12+hrs with no issues. \r\n\r\n# Risk\r\n\r\nVery targeted fix, both @jkotas and I have stepped through the unwinder logic and it's as minimally invasive as possible while preserving correctness.

Some calls are significant slower if the default printer is a network printer, even if I explicit set a local printer name.\n\nAfter studying referencesource I think I found the culprit.\n\nI call:\n\nvar printerSettings = new System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings();\n\nprinterSettings.PrinterName = &quot;LOCALPRINTER&quot;;\n\n// the next call is slow if the OS default printer is a network printer\nvar res = printerSettings.DefaultPageSettings.PrinterResolution\n\nInternally FastDeviceCapabilities is called.\n\nFastDeviceCapabilities calls GetOutputPort. But GetOutput port return the port of the default printer and not the port of the given printer!\n\nIn addition, DeviceCapabilities is then called with a wrong combination of printer name and port, don't know if this could lead to additional problems.\n\nResolution: GetOutputPort should return the port of the given printer and not accessing the default printer at all.\n\nBest Regards,\nRaphael\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Raphael Affolter on 1/20/2020, 04:03 AM: \n\n<p>I forgot to mention: .Net Framework 4.6.1</p>\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 1/20/2020, 06:51 PM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

Therefore, at runtime when `MyLib.dll` tries to access `PkgA.dll, Version=1.0.0`, but instead finds `PkgA.dll, Version=2.0.0`, the fusion loader throws an assembly load exception.\r\n\r\n## Repro steps\r\n\r\nIt's a bit involved, sorry 😞 \r\n\r\n[npnjRuntie.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/files/6025829/npnjRuntie.zip)\r\n\r\nIn this repro:\r\n\r\n* `MyLib` has `<PackageReference Include=\"NuGet.Protocol\" Version=\"4.9.4\" PrivateAssets=\"compile\" />`\r\n* NuGet.Protocol has a dependency on Newtonsoft.Json version 9.0.0\r\n* Pack MyLib to get `MyLib.1.0.0.nupkg`, and copy it to `$(root)\\nupkgs\\`.\r\n* Now, clear `$(root)\\gpf` if MyApp has already been restored, and then restore MyApp.\r\n* MyApp has `<PackageReference Include=\"MyLib\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />` and `<PackageReference Include=\"Newtonsoft.Json\" Version=\"12.0.2\" />`\r\n\r\nRun MyApp\r\n\r\n## Actual\r\n\r\n`MyApp.exe.config` does not have any binding redirects. Running the app gives this error:\r\n\r\n> Unhandled Exception: NuGet.Protocol.Core.Types.FatalProtocolException: Unable to load the service index for source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json. ---> System.IO.FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly 'Newtonsoft.Json, Version=9.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=30ad4fe6b2a6aeed' or one of its dependencies.

Therefore, I do not believe the problem is due to NuGet, but is instead due to the .NET SDK or msbuild.\r\n\r\nLooking at binlogs of the two builds, when using the project reference, I see that ResolveAssemblyReferences is run, but when using the package reference, I see a log message explicitly saying `No suggested binding redirects from ResolveAssemblyReferences`.

We'll do this a few days before and we'll leave it there for two weeks.\r\n\r\n**You don't need to update your PRs**. If you submitted a PR against the old default branch, the GitHub tooling will automatically retarget your PR against the new default branch (main).\r\n\r\nFor sanity, **you should rename the default branch in your fork as well**. When you go to your fork, GitHub will guide you through this experience:\r\n\r\n![Rename branch in fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/105210186-92bdba80-5aff-11eb-99c9-0beb708fcf3f.png)\r\n\r\n**You will need to update the repos you cloned to your hard drive**.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.

This means [.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) is no longer supported and updates will no longer be provided. We recommend moving to [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/), our long term support (LTS) release.\r\n\r\n- [Download .NET Core 3.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/3.1)\r\n- [.NET Core 2.2 end-of-life statement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-2-2-will-reach-end-of-life-on-december-23-2019/)\r\n\r\nWe've created an issue at [dotnet/core#4084](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/4084) for your questions and comments.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Lifecycle\r\n\r\n.NET Core releases belong to one of two [support lifecycles](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy): long term support (LTS) and Current. LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-2/) was released in December 2018 as a Current release. Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1363999517423640586","CreatedAt":"2021-02-22T23:50:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"This month, the @ASPNET blog focuses on building HTTP APIs with #dotNET 5.

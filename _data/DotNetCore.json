The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

Instead the build hangs for 45+ mins(forever?)\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\nI've attached the repro project - this compiles quickly with the .NET 7 SDK, but never (effectively) with the .NET 8 SDK. The problem appears to be around deeply nested class hierarchies (which are present in the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Odata](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.OData) library - the hierarchies in this sample are based on that)\r\n\r\n[DeepNestedHierarchy.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/files/12856489/DeepNestedHierarchy.zip)\r\n\r\nAs a further test I tried to build the [Microsoft.AspNetCore.OData](https://github.com/OData/AspNetCoreOData) project itself using the .NET 8 SDK and I see the exact same problem.\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n\r\nN/A - it spins forever\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Using <code>8.0.100-rc.1.23463.5</code>.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"702426498","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-16T06:07:11","Actor":"billvenhaus","Number":"1774","RawContent":null,"Title":"[UWP] HttpClientHandler - Digest Authentication Broken on Windows 10 PC","State":"closed","Body":"Just recently I found that my UWP app can no longer connect with Digest authentication on Windows 10 PCs.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption.

And the changes are identical to those in the other backports.\r\n\r\n# Regression\r\n\r\nThis is not a regression.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43141","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/2.1] Fix ReadOnlySequence created out of sliced Memory owned by MemoryManager\" (#43141)"},{"Id":"1224389900","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-03T19:24:35","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43143","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.26","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43143","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.26\" (#43143)"},{"Id":"1202264239","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-13T04:53:34","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43142","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merging internal commits for release/3.1","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43142","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Merging internal commits for release/3.1\" (#43142)"},{"Id":"1193653850","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-05T21:51:59","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43140","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.25","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43140","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.25\" (#43140)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Roslyn-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1936668251","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-11T02:35:30","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"70334","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: Perform source gen out of proc (sync all)","State":"open","Body":"https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=8520544&view=results","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/70334","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"WIP: Perform source gen out of proc (sync all)\" (#70334)"},{"Id":"1936665294","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-11T02:33:16","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"70333","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: Perform source gen out of proc (sync project cone)","State":"open","Body":"https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/DevDiv/_build/results?buildId=8520541&view=results","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/70333","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"WIP: Perform source gen out of proc (sync project cone)\" (#70333)"},{"Id":"1936611044","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-11T01:33:49","Actor":"arkalyanms","Number":"70332","RawContent":null,"Title":"Completion on LSP experiment","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/70332","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Completion on LSP experiment\" (#70332)"},{"Id":"1936575771","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-11T01:07:40","Actor":"jasonmalinowski","Number":"70331","RawContent":null,"Title":"Pass along analyzer references to projects","State":"open","Body":"This should fix all of the reports we had of generators not running.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/vscode-csharp/issues/5999 (and many many duplicates)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/70331","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Pass along analyzer references to projects\" (#70331)"},{"Id":"1936475166","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-10T23:39:37","Actor":"jasonmalinowski","Number":"70330","RawContent":null,"Title":"Change Blazor template group name for newer templates","State":"open","Body":"Right now this is just to test against our official images, and not intended for merge.

In this case, all formatting occurs on the managed side and the native side only ever receives a single string argument with no format specifiers.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvoid Log(LogLevel level, [InterpolatedStringHandlerArgument(nameof(level))] ref LogInterpolatedStringHandler format) {...}\r\n\r\nvoid Log(LogLevel level, string format) { ... }\r\nvoid Log<T1>(LogLevel level, string format, T arg1) { ... }\r\nvoid Log<T1, T2>(LogLevel level, string format, T1 arg1, T2 arg2) { ... }\r\nvoid Log<T1, T2, T3>(LogLevel level, string format, T1 arg1, T2 arg2, T3 arg3) { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNew applications using the managed wrapper would likely use the interpolated string overload. However, in order to test the managed wrapper, I began porting a few existing C applications and find that one of the more time consuming and error prone aspects is the translation of the format specifiers.\r\n\r\nSo I thought this would be a good excuse to experiment with interceptors and implemented a source generator that intercepts calls to the `Log` method and translates the C format specifiers to an interpolated string. \r\n\r\nFor example, given the following call:\r\n```C#\r\nLog(\"Error: %d, message: %s\", code, message);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe source generator emits the following interceptor:\r\n```C#\r\n[global::System.Runtime.CompilerServices.InterceptsLocation(\"...\", line: ..., column: ...)]\r\ninternal static string Log<T1, T2>(int logLevel, string format, T1 arg1, T2 arg2)\r\n  => Log(logLevel, $\"Error: {arg1} - message: {arg2}\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works very well until the number of format specifiers in the original format string exceeds the overload with the largest number of arguments. While the source generator emits valid code in this scenario, since it only requires the interpolated string handler overload, there's an error at the call site as this would require an overload with arguments T1 to T4.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability. A patch for this vulnerability (nicknamed \"Rapid Reset\") is being released in coordination with other industry partners.\r\n\r\nA vulnerability exists in the ASP.NET Core Kestrel web server where a malicious client may flood the server with specially crafted HTTP/2 requests, causing denial of service.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at   https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/51264\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nServers without HTTP/2 enabled are not affected.\r\nTo limit your application to HTTP1.1 via config, edit your appsettings.json to include a protocols setting for each endpoint: \r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"Kestrel\": { \r\n    \"Endpoints\": { \r\n      \"http\": { \r\n        // your existing config \r\n        \"Protocols\": \"Http1\" \r\n      }, \r\n      \"https\": { \r\n         // your existing config \r\n        \"Protocols\": \"Http1\" \r\n      } \r\n    } \r\n  } \r\n```\r\nVisit [Configure options for the ASP.NET Core Kestrel web server](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/options?view=aspnetcore-7.0) to learn more about creating config files.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also limit kestrel via code, in your program.cs / Main() function by added the highlighted code to the listen options for each of your endpoints: \r\n\r\n```\r\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args); \r\nbuilder.WebHost.UseKestrel(options => \r\n{ \r\n    options.Listen(IPAddress.Any, 5000, listenOptions => \r\n    { \r\n        listenOptions.Protocols = HttpProtocols.Http1; \r\n    }); \r\n}); \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\n* Any ASP.NET Core 6.0 application running on .NET 6.0.22 or earlier.\r\n* Any ASP.NET Core 7.0 application running on .NET 7.0.11 or earlier.\r\n* Any ASP.NET Core 8.0 application running on .NET 8.0 RC1 or earlier.\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 6.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 8.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\r\n* If you are using one of the affected packages, please update to the patched version listed above.\r\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n\r\n Version:   6.0.300\r\n Commit:    8473146e7d\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n\r\n  Version: 6.0.5\r\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n\r\n  6.0.300 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.5 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0 RC2 Runtime  or .NET 8.0 RC2 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.8) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 7.0, you should download and install Runtime 7.0.12 or SDK 7.0.112 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 6.0, you should download and install Runtime 6.0.23 or SDK 6.0.318 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.2) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0.\r\n\r\n.NET 6.0 and and .NET 7.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update. To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n#### **Fine tuning the patch**\r\nThe patch introduces two new AppContext properties: \r\n\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxEnhanceYourCalmCount `\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize `\r\n\r\nThe properties can be set in a [variety](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime-config/) of ways, including AppContext.SetData or AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetData in code (the former is not available in 6.0), RuntimeHostConfigurationOption in a project file, or environment variables. \r\n\r\nMaxEnhanceYourCalmCount is a cap on how many ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM (EYC) messages (generally triggered by excessive client stream resets) the server can send per second on a particular connection without dropping it.  The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

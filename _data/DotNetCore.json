The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"702426498","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-16T06:07:11","Actor":"billvenhaus","Number":"1774","RawContent":null,"Title":"[UWP] HttpClientHandler - Digest Authentication Broken on Windows 10 PC","State":"closed","Body":"Just recently I found that my UWP app can no longer connect with Digest authentication on Windows 10 PCs.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption.

However, if the user chooses to preserve the field, then we still wants the constructor to write to the fields and not hte properties.  As such, we have a filter that can be passed into rename to filter out the locations found in the constructor body so that they are not updated.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Use-Auto-Prop wants to update all existing reference to some field, and update them to now be the name of the property that will be used in its stead.  However, definitionally, rename then views these all as errors *precisely* because the reference locations change meaning.  To address this, we have a set of symbols that we pass into rename where we say \"it is acceptable to change binding meaning if you're binding to this new symbol\"\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\nI propose that we codify these two capabilities as advanced knobs on the options object pass to rename.  Specifically:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n+ public readonly record struct SymbolRenameOptions\r\n+ {\r\n+    // Locations in the solution that will not have references renamed within.\r\n+    public ImmutableArray<DocumentSpan> IgnoreLocations { get; }\r\n\r\n+    // Symbols that a reference can bind to that will not have conflict resolution performed on them.\r\n+    public ImmutableArray<ISymbol> IgnoreConflictResolutionSymbols { get; }\r\n+ }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: these capabilities *are* what rename already supports, it is just through internal APIs. \r\n\r\nNote: i'm very open for better names here.  Also, note: we want to make these all 'data' (and not something like lambda callbacks) as this operates on the server end and so has to be marshallable over to OOP.  We can do this trivially with document-spans, and we already do this today with Symbol-IDs.\r\n\r\nDoing this will make features like 'use auto prop' now be available in the code style layer.  Which would be very nice for layering.

However this is unnecessary for the user to know. 99% of the time the other 99% of the methods are used. Thus it seems counter intuitive to use `[]` instead of  `new()`. Even though the emitted code might be the same code, it conveys a different meaning. Our class is not \"just a collection\".\r\n\r\ncurrently we have a pattern/design like this (simplified):\r\n```cs\r\ninternal class MyClass\r\n{\r\n  public void Do()\r\n  {\r\n    using Context ctx = new();\r\n//                      ^- IDE0028: Collection initialization can be simplified\r\n    SomeEntity thing = ctx.Get(123);\r\n    SomeEntity other = ctx.CreateNew();\r\n    ctx.Commit();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic sealed class Context : IEnumerable<SomeEntity>, IDisposable\r\n{\r\n  public void Add(SomeEntity entity) { }\r\n  public SomeEntity Get(int key) => new();\r\n  public SomeEntity CreateNew() => new();\r\n  public void Commit() { }\r\n  public IEnumerator<SomeEntity> GetEnumerator() => throw new NotImplementedException();\r\n  IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator() => throw new NotImplementedException();\r\n  public void Dispose() => throw new NotImplementedException();\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic sealed class SomeEntity\r\n{ \r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\nSince changing the implementation is out of the question due to far too many usages and possible breaking changes, it would be great to have something akin to this, from where the analyzers would infer to not pursue any optimization/analysis for this type.\r\n```diff\r\n+[NoCollectionInitializer]\r\npublic sealed class Context : IEnumerable<SomeEntity>, IDisposable\r\n{\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurther extending on that, there might be a Parameter on the attribute that could change the agressiveness. For Example:\r\n`NoCollectionInitializer(Aggressive=false)` (default?) would only stop the analyzers from generating suggestions. `NoCollectionInitializer(Aggressive=true)` could make the compiler emit a warning or error, because collection initialization is strictly not allowed.\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\nthe function `MyClass.Do()`would not contain any Diagnostics after applying the Attribut to `Context`\r\n\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\n\r\n(don't now)\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\n(don't know)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/71171","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Collection Initializer Expression `[]` should be disallowable per type (e.g. via Attribute?)\" (#71171)"},{"Id":"2032939010","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-08T16:05:55","Actor":"AlekseyTs","Number":"71172","RawContent":null,"Title":"An application of a CollectionBuilder attribute in source is not validated","State":"open","Body":"```\r\n        [Fact]\r\n        public void Test()\r\n        {\r\n            string sourceA = \"\"\"\r\n                using System;\r\n                using System.Collections;\r\n                using System.Collections.Generic;\r\n                using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;\r\n                [CollectionBuilder(typeof(MyCollectionBuilder), \"Dummy\")]\r\n                class MyCollection1 : IEnumerable<int>\r\n                {\r\n                    IEnumerator<int> IEnumerable<int>.GetEnumerator() => throw null;\r\n                    IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator() => throw null;\r\n                }\r\n                class MyCollectionBuilder\r\n                {\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                class Program\r\n                {\r\n                    static void Main()\r\n                    {\r\n                        MyCollection1 x = [1];\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n                \"\"\";\r\n            CreateCompilation(\r\n                sourceA,\r\n                targetFramework: TargetFramework.Net80).VerifyEmitDiagnostics(\r\n                // (19,27): error CS9187: Could not find an accessible 'Dummy' method with the expected signature: a static method with a single parameter of type 'ReadOnlySpan<int>' and return type 'MyCollection1'.\r\n                //         MyCollection1 x = [1];\r\n                Diagnostic(ErrorCode.ERR_CollectionBuilderAttributeMethodNotFound, \"[1]\").WithArguments(\"Dummy\", \"int\", \"MyCollection1\").WithLocation(19, 27)\r\n                );\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\nAn error at the application of a CollectionBuilder attribute about the fact that it doesn't point at the right place.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/71172","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"An application of a CollectionBuilder attribute in source is not validated\" (#71172)"},{"Id":"2032634358","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-08T14:42:04","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"71170","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:7e4fe80a-482b-4a41-5b66-08d8d8feb47e)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: 7e4fe80a-482b-4a41-5b66-08d8d8feb47e\r\n- **Build**: 20231207.2\r\n- **Date Produced**: December 7, 2023 11:06:00 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 3faeb9817f465151aa4bbcdb315f0a6170206760\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

For example, a project with a `TargetFramework` of `net7.0` will need to react to this breaking change if it gets built with the .NET 8 SDK.\r\n\r\n### Context\r\n\r\nThe Static Web Assets feature was moved from the Blazor WebAssembly SDK into its own SDK in .NET 8. As part of this work, MSBuild properties with the name `Blazor` in them were renamed to indicate that they are not limited to Blazor scenarios.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/283","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Static Web Assets Compression Flag Breaking Change\" (#283)"},{"Id":"1935860595","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-24T17:20:29","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"277","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2023-44487: .NET Denial of Service Vulnerability","State":"closed","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2023-44487: .NET Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\n Microsoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 8.0 RC1, .NET 7.0 ,and .NET 6.0.

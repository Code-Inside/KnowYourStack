The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

Which makes the Intellisense behave differently based on the class/record.\n\nIt would be preferrable if the Intellisense behaved the same in both cases.\nThis is a productivity issue.\n\n```\npublic class Test\n{\n    public record ARecordWithRequired\n    {\n        public required Guid RequiredProperty { get; init; }\n    }\n\npublic record ARecordWithoutRequired\n    {\n        public Guid NonRequiredProperty { get; init; }\n    }\n\n[Test]\n    public void Test1()\n    {\n        // Creating a record without a required property allows me to press enter after the creation\n        var x = new ARecordWithoutRequired\n        {\n            \n}\n    }\n\npublic void Test2()\n    {\n        // Creating a record with a required property, I MUST press Escape after the creation.\n        // The problem with this, is that when making a new instance, I don't know in advance if there\n        // will be any required properties in my object, so the flow is different only based on the data\n        // inside the record.\n        // In this example, I typed slowly, but when typing fast, I always mess this up.\n        var x = new ARecordWithRequired { RequiredProperty}\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Jean-Sébastien Goupil on 8/29/2025, 08:58 PM: \n\n<p>It also happens if you do</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> x = <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">new</span> List&lt;ARecordWithRequired&gt; { <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// HERE you get ARecordWithRequired appended which doesn't make sense</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is all the time regardless if something is required or not in the class.<br>\nBut does NOT happen with primitive.</p>\n\n#### Jean-Sébastien Goupil on 8/29/2025, 09:37 PM: \n\n<p>Furthermore, this problem is not happening if you are nested within an object already.</p>\n<pre><code><span class=\"hljs-keyword\">var</span> x = <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">new</span> List&lt;ARecordWithRequired&gt;\n{\n    <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">new</span> ARecordWithRequired { <span class=\"hljs-comment\">// No intellisense kicks in here, so once again, pressing Enter differs</span>\n}</code></pre>\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 9/1/2025, 07:39 AM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

Or at least an analyzer should tell us something is wrong.\n\nI made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmOZrUE20Ck) explaining the issue.\n\nI am the maintainer of a widely used library, and a user reported a bug to me.  \nThis happened:\n\n* Only on the Android runtime (though I don’t think Android itself is at fault)\n* Only on the fifth execution of the problematic code\n* Attempts to isolate the behavior in a simple `Program.cs` did not reproduce it\n\nI managed to [pin down the specific code](https://github.com/MetacoSA/NBitcoin/issues/1289#issuecomment-3605004733) that was causing the issue.\n\nThis code just create a variable a of type `GEJ` (readonly struct), then re-affect to itself 10 times.\n\n```csharp\nvar a = new GEJ(new FE(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), new FE(11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 11), new FE(21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 210));\nfor (int o = 0; o < 10; o++)\n{\n\tAddLogs(logs, \"Before\", a);\n\ta = new GEJ(a.x, a.y, a.z, a.infinity);\n\tAddLogs(logs, \"After\", a);\n}\n```\n\nThis code, when running outside of Android or outside my library, behaved as expected: the value of `a` did not change.\n\nHowever, on Android and within my library’s code, it would deterministically stop working after roughly five iterations of the loop. After the fifth iteration, `a` would become `0`.\n\nThe bug was here... can you see it?\n```csharp\npublic GEJ(in FE x, in FE y, in FE z, bool infinity)\n```\n\nAnd the fix was to [remove in from the constructor](https://github.com/MetacoSA/NBitcoin/commit/61ab4bd60f66de022bab50fb8cfef85a79a4dd85#diff-6149606ff239e370c78f8beebc950efc0e5d1b73bbcdf2a4c9cb1663738c64c4L44).\n\nWhat I believe happens is that when executing `a = new GEJ(a.x, a.y, a.z, a.infinity);`, in some unclear circumstances, the runtime zeros the stack space for variable `a` before running the constructor. But because those were `in` parameters, no copy was made and `a.x` is passed by reference and is equal to zero due to the stack cleaning.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis bug is triggered under such precise circumstances that I feel the language, or at least a Roslyn analyzer, should prevent us from using in in a struct constructor.

While investigating, it seemed like the only possible way for us to hit this crash on the OOP side was if the calls within `TryComputeNewGeneratorInfoInRemoteProcessAsync` to `GetSourceGeneratedDocumentInfoAsync` and `GetContentsAsync` were operating on different solution instances.\r\n\r\nHowever, that was supposed to not happen, due to us creating an OOP  `KeepAliveSession` prior to both calls to 'pin' that solution on the OOP side.\r\n\r\nHowever, looking more closely at `KeepAliveSession`, i realized there were two major problems with how we were using it.\r\n\r\nFirst, the solution we were asking it to pin in OOP wasn't hte same as the solution we were then asking for in those two calls.  Specifically, the KeepAliveSession was pinning the full solution, while the individual calls were asking for Project-Cone subsets of hte solution.  As nothing was pinning those, it was possible for the individual calls to get different instances, allowing them to be out of sync.\r\n\r\nSecond, KeepAliveSession was originally written as a 'best effort' helper.  It would make a call over to OOP to pin the solution, but then return immediately, prior to the actual solution being fully remoted and actually pinned.  This was fine for most features, as this was only intended to help speed things up.  But it was not ok for the source-gen case as we are depending on the invariant that the project-cone actually be pinned, so that the next two calls must see that exact instance.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes both.  First, the KeepAliveSession we now make is specific to the project-cone we need pinned.  Second, the KeepAliveSession system has been fixed up so that now it only returns back to the caller once the actual solution is pinned on the OOP side, ensuring that it must be there.

This PR provides detailed instructions for reverting those changes.\n\n**Branch Base Limitation:**\nThis PR branch is based on `main`, while PR #52007 is based on `darc-release/9.0.3xx`. Due to the different branch bases, the actual revert commit cannot be included in this PR branch.\n\n**Revert Commit Created:**\n- A proper revert commit (`368e8b3a5e`) was created locally based on PR #52007's HEAD\n- The commit reverts all changes from 7bd19ab8af including error handling, whitespace, and newline changes\n- Verified complete with `git diff` showing no differences from pre-7bd19ab8af state\n\n**Documentation Provided:**\n- `REVERT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` contains detailed manual application steps\n- Instructions include exact line-by-line changes needed to revert 7bd19ab8af\n- Verification commands provided to confirm revert is complete\n\n**Changes to Revert:**\n1. Error handling for `$GlobalJson.tools.vs` - back to simple: `if (!$vsRequirements) { $vsRequirements = $GlobalJson.tools.vs }`\n2.

Please describe.\r\n> \r\n> The `PlatformTarget` field (and therefore Platform in MSbuild) only applies to .NET Framework and doesn't apply to modern .NET applications. For these applications, Platform can (should) always be `AnyCPU`. We should guide users to removing customizations to this property for projects that do not need it.\r\n> \r\n> From Jan Kotas in dotnet/sdk#42344:\r\n> \r\n> > PlatformTarget is left-over from .NET Framework. (PlatformTarget can only represent architectures that .NET Framework targets. It does not represent full range of platforms that .NET Core can target.)\r\n> >\r\n> > If you are targeting current .NET, building everything as AnyCPU (ie hardcoding PlatformTarget to AnyCPU) all the time should work just fine. It is what we are doing in dotnet/runtime repo.

This type has been forwarded to assembly 'System.Private.Xml.Linq, Version=8.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51' Consider adding a reference to that assembly.`\n\nIt's true that the runtime assemblies for .NET 8.0 do happen to define `XElement` in `System.Private.Xml.Linq`, but that's not the case for the reference assemblies. At build time it should be sufficient to have a reference just to `System.Xml.XDocument`; the fact that the .NET 8.0 runtime happens to implement that somewhere else is an implementation detail, something that could change from one version of .NET to the next, and not something that you're supposed to be making assumptions about at build time.\n\nFor this particular example, I can work around this by adding the reference it says it wants:\n\n```tt\n<#@ template debug=\"false\" hostspecific=\"false\" language=\"C#\" #>\n<#@ assembly name=\"System.Xml.XDocument\" #>\n<#@ assembly name=\"System.Private.Xml.Linq\" #>\n\n<#=typeof(System.Xml.Linq.XElement)#>\n```\n\nHowever, this is a fragile solution (because it bakes in an assumption about internal implementation choices made by the .NET runtime) and should be unnecessary.\n\nWithin the .NET tool chain, the distinction between reference assemblies and runtime assemblies is typically important, and the norm is for reference assemblies to be supplied at compile time, and runtime assemblies to be used at runtime. Failure to do this causes this kind of problem with assemblies built into the .NET runtime. It will also cause problems for other libraries that use a similar distinction. (E.g., I'm the lead maintainer of Rx.NET (https://github.com/dotnet/reactive) and we have some components that have slightly different runtime and ref assembly surface areas to support certain backwards compatibility scenarios. These libraries might well be essentially unusable with TextTransformCore . Mind you, since those are distributed via NuGet, there's also the larger problem that T4 doesn't provide a way to add a NuGet reference.)\n\nAs far as I can tell, TextTransformCore simply doesn't make this distinction. From what I've been able to tell, at some point during its internal initialization, it rewrites assembly directives of this kind by calling `AssemblyContext.LoadFromAssemblyName`, which gives you the runtime assembly, and it then supplies the resulting path to the compiler. In effect, the tool appears to act as if runtime assemblies are always suitable for use at build time. But as `System.Xml.XDocument` shows, this is definitely not true.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/52012","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"TextTransformCore uses runtime (not ref) assemblies during build\" (#52012)"},{"Id":"3692740468","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-04T07:19:18","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"52009","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/9.0.3xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/templating","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:75c4fc27-6ecc-4034-8836-2e455df40818)\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/templating\n- **Subscription**: [75c4fc27-6ecc-4034-8836-2e455df40818](https://maestro.dot.net/subscriptions?search=75c4fc27-6ecc-4034-8836-2e455df40818)\n- **Build**: [20251203.5](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=2853304) ([293263](https://maestro.dot.net/channel/6417/github:dotnet:templating/build/293263))\n- **Date Produced**: December 4, 2025 3:33:23 AM UTC\n- **Commit**: [63c10ce5ef38119809e0b50c110c53c09589c4a3](https://github.com/dotnet/templating/commit/63c10ce5ef38119809e0b50c110c53c09589c4a3)\n- **Branch**: [release/9.0.3xx](https://github.com/dotnet/templating/tree/release/9.0.3xx)\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Dependency Updates**:\n  - From [9.0.309 to 9.0.309][1]\n     - Microsoft.TemplateEngine.Abstractions\n  - From [9.0.309-servicing.25602.9 to 9.0.309-servicing.25603.5][1]\n     - Microsoft.TemplateEngine.Mocks\n\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/templating/compare/a4a8aaf993...63c10ce5ef\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\n\n\n[marker]: <> (End:75c4fc27-6ecc-4034-8836-2e455df40818)\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/52009","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/9.0.3xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/templating\" (#52009)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Announcements-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"3612894501","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-11T15:54:32","Actor":"jongalloway","Number":"377","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 - Release","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/10157.

It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, as appropriate. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.17  Runtime or .NET 8.0.314 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.10 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.6  Runtime or .NET 9.0.107 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

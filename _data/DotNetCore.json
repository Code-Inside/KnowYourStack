FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\r\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n\r\n Version:   8.0.200\r\n Commit:    8473146e7d\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n\r\n  Version: 8.0.3\r\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n\r\n  8.0.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.3  Runtime or .NET 8.0.202 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.8) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 7.0, you should download and install Runtime 7.0.17 or SDK 7.0.117 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.\r\n\r\n.NET 7.0 and, .NET 8.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update. To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty.

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

Then kick off work to get the compilation for the current project (in the host and oop), then kick off an event to compute tags again, again using frozen-partial-semantics. The issue with that was the presumption that if a compilation was successfully retrieved that the next frozen-partial snapshot would contain information from that.  That's not how frozen-partial works though.  As it is just a snapshot system, once we build that snapshot, it's fixed (and we want that, so that all the features talking to the same frozen snapshot get all the normal caching we want for solution snapshots).  So the next frozen-partial-request could still just get the same results as the prior time, effectively making the call pointless.\r\n\r\nThe new approach changes things fundamentally at the tagger level in the following fashion:\r\n\r\n1. Taggers can state that they support computing results with frozen-partial-semantics.\r\n2. For taggers that do (classification, reference highlighting, and inheritance margin tagger), the tagger system itself will first compute tags on a frozen-partial solution, calling into the tag provider, also telling it to compute with frozen-partial semantics.   It will then report these tags as normal.\r\n3. Then, after computing that set of possibly-incorrect tags, the tagger will re-enqueue work to compute tags *again*, this time with *non-frozen-partial* snapshots.  This work is only then done at the next tagging step if no more work has come in to do normal frozen-partial-tagging.\r\n4. the tagger will then run again, but this time with a normal snapshot, with the normal costs associated with it.  \r\n\r\nThis change now means that the last piece of work one of these taggers will always do is a request to tag on a real full snapshot, with full semantics.  So if there are any inaccurate/incomplete tags from a prior frozen-tagging pass, they will be updated to now be correct.\r\n\r\nPerf should also be fine as we always prefer to do work for the frozen-case first, continuously computing in a fast, but inaccurate, mode as long as events keep coming in. Only once there is a lull in processing will we be able to get to the full mode.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/72878","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Ensure taggers that compute frozen partial data eventually move to a 'correct' final state.\" (#72878)"},{"Id":"2226129666","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-04T17:29:14","Actor":"jcouv","Number":"72877","RawContent":null,"Title":"Classify most PROTOTYPE comments by implementation phase","State":"open","Body":"Also addresses one PROTOTYPE comment by renaming a method","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/72877","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Classify most PROTOTYPE comments by implementation phase\" (#72877)"},{"Id":"2226026917","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-04T16:38:53","Actor":"vsfeedback","Number":"72876","RawContent":null,"Title":"AbstractFileHeaderDiagnosticAnalyzer uses `CustomSeverityConfigurable` but does not provide a way to set the custom severity","State":"open","Body":"_This issue has been moved from [a ticket on Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Analyzer-ignores-settings/10625971)._\n\n---\n[severity:I'm unable to use this version] [regression] [worked-in:`17.7.5`]\nAnalyzer ignores settings\nthe file (.editorconfig) contains the header settings\n\n```\n# File header preferences\ndotnet_diagnostic.IDE0073.severity = warning\nfile_header_template = <copyright file=\"{fileName}\" company=\"MyCompany\">\\nCopyright (c) Company.

Etc.\r\n\r\nRoslyn does not provide APIs that would make it easy to resolve runtime entities for a given `ISymbol`.\r\n\r\nThe new API would enable cleaner and simpler implementation of [Semantic Search](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/71268) feature: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/src/Features/Core/Portable/SemanticSearch/AbstractSemanticSearchService.cs#L327\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\nA new overload of Emit method that takes and additional `tokenRequests` parameter.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace Microsoft.CodeAnalysis;\r\n\r\npublic class Compilation\r\n{\r\n+    public EmitResult Emit(\r\n+         Stream peStream,\r\n+         Stream? pdbStream = null,\r\n+         Stream? xmlDocumentationStream = null,\r\n+         Stream? win32Resources = null,\r\n+         IEnumerable<ResourceDescription>? manifestResources = null,\r\n+         EmitOptions? options = null,\r\n+         IMethodSymbol? debugEntryPoint = null,\r\n+         Stream? sourceLinkStream = null,\r\n+         IEnumerable<EmbeddedText>? embeddedTexts = null,\r\n+         Stream? metadataPEStream = null,\r\n+         IEnumerable<ISymbol>? metadataTokenRequests = null,\r\n+         CancellationToken cancellationToken = default(CancellationToken))\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class EmitResult\r\n{\r\n+      /// <summary>\r\n+      /// If <see cref=\"Success\"/> is true, returns metadata tokens emitted for the symbols specified in\r\n+      /// metadataTokenRequests parameter of the Emit method. \r\n+      /// If the specified symbol does not have a token in the emitted image the corresponding item in this array will be 0.\r\n+      /// </summary>\r\n+      public ImmutableArray<int> RequestedMetadataTokens { get; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the specified `ISymbol` is a type, method or local function, field, property, event, parameter, generic parameter symbol defined in the source of the compilation the token will be a definition token: TypeDef, MethodDef, FieldDef, Property, Event, Param, GenericParam, respectively.\r\nIf the specified `ISymbol` is a type symbol that is referenced from the emitted metadata or IL the token will be a reference token (AssemblyRef, TypeRef, MemberRef, TypeSpec, MethodSpec).\r\nOtherwise (local variable, using alias, PE symbol that is not referenced, etc.), the token is 0.\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\n``` C#\r\nvar result = compilation.EmitResult(peStream)\r\n\r\nusing var peStream = new MemoryStream();\r\n\r\nvar emitResult = queryCompilation.Emit(peStream, options: emitOptions, tokenRequests: [functionSymbol], cancellationToken: cancellationToken);\r\n\r\nif (!emitResult.Success)\r\n{\r\n     return;\r\n}\r\n\r\npeStream.Position = 0;\r\nvar assembly = AssemblyLoadContext.Default.LoadFromStream(peStream);    \r\nvar functionToken = emitResult.RequestedMetadataTokens[0];\r\nvar info = assembly.ManifestModule.ResolveMethod(functionToken);\r\n  \r\ninfo.Invoke(...);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\n\r\nWe can limit the implementation to definition tokens only.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/72869","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Return tokens to emitted symbols on EmitResult\" (#72869)"},{"Id":"2223527423","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-03T17:39:17","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"72868","RawContent":null,"Title":"Investigate changes to LSP pull-diagnostics to make it more efficient.","State":"open","Body":"Right now, the protocol is not efficient at all, sending huge messages, and requiring lots of information to have to be sent back and forth.  We should investigate improvements to the protocol to remove redundancy, and allow for the queries that we are passed to be much smaller in scope (like asking for project level diagnostics, not solution level).\r\n\r\nOptions we should examine:\r\n\r\n1. When possible, not including data, and moving it to a 'resolve' step.  A possible candidate for this is Diagnostics.CodeDescription.Href.  This is often a large string like \"{https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/ide0055}\", on top of the json for `\"CodeDescription\"={\"Href\"=\"{https://...}\"}`.  Moving to resolving this only if and when needed by the UI would be helpful.\r\n\r\n2. Moving repetitive data to a common header location.  A common example is the information about the associated project for a particular diagnostic which is usually repeated over all diagnostics.  This is normally an array like `\"Projects\"=[{\"ProjectIdentifier\"=\"...guid...\",ProjectName=\"Potentially.Long.Project.Name\"}]`.  Placing this info about each referenced project up front would allow each diagnostic to then reference these by index, greatly reducing the size.\r\n\r\n3. Moving certain strings to enums.  `\"DiagnosticType\"=\"Style\"` could just reference a number instead.\r\n\r\n4. Compressing how we encode data.  Ranges are the most egregious problem.  Needing to send `\"Range\"={\"Start\"={\"Line\"=6,\"Character\"=15},\"End\"={\"Line\"=6,\"Character\"=27}}` where `\"Span\"=\"45,12\"` would do.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/72868","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Investigate changes to LSP pull-diagnostics to make it more efficient.\" (#72868)"},{"Id":"2223518536","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-03T17:34:24","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"72867","RawContent":null,"Title":"Roslyn needs to move to System.Text.Json for LSP messages.","State":"open","Body":"Newtonsoft is much heavier and there are nice wins we can get by moving to that.

This is expected.\r\n\r\nIf `\"rollForward\": \"latestMajor\"` is added to global.json and there's some SDK _x+.m.n_ installed on the system, then invoking `dotnet restore` and `dotnet run` on this project succeeds. This is expected too.\r\n\r\nHowever, if instead of adding `\"rollForward\": \"latestMajor\"` to global.json, I try to use \"roll forward\" in the command line, I notice that, even though such a `--roll-forward` flag exists, it's only available as a runtime option, i.e.:\r\n- I can run an already built project through `dotnet --roll-forward LatestMajor project.dll` with success.\r\n- There isn't an equivalent `dotnet --roll-forward LatestMajor restore` (or similar) through which I can restore/build the project.\r\n\r\nIn summary, for running a project, it's possible to \"escape\" global.json from the command line (or with [environment variables like DOTNET_ROLL_FORWARD](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-environment-variables)), but for restoring/building a project, it isn't possible to do the same.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, at least one of the following is an issue:\r\n1. The behavior/applicability of `rollForward` from global.json is inconsistent with that of `--roll-forward` from the command line; in which case, `--roll-forward` should be made available for other `dotnet` commands too.\r\n2. There's an inconsistency in the terminology between global.json and `dotnet` command, as \"roll forward\" for one doesn't mean the same as \"roll forward\" for the other; in which case, the terminology should be adjusted, e.g. to `runtime-roll-forward`.\r\n\r\n#### By the way...\r\n\r\nI also noticed that any arbitrary text added in global.json for `\"rollForward\":\"whatever\"` allows the SDK version checks to be escaped, while the command line's `--roll-forward` is strict and checks the content: when it's invalid, it throws a \"Unrecognized roll forward setting value 'whatever' error.\r\n\r\n(Tested with 8.0.100-rc.1.23463.5.)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/39989","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"inconsistent \"roll forward\" terminology or behavior/applicability\" (#39989)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Announcements-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2182238393","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-12T17:12:58","Actor":"JonDouglas","Number":"301","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 9 Preview 2","State":"open","Body":"We are pleased to announce the release of the second preview of .NET 9, along with comprehensive release notes that highlight significant enhancements from the initial preview.

It’s long been known by security practitioners that any deserializer, binary or text, which allows its input to carry information about the objects to be created is a security problem waiting to happen. There is even a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) that describes the issue, [CWE-502 “Deserialization of Untrusted Data”](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html) and examples of this type of vulnerability run from security issues in Exchange through security issues in Apache. Within Microsoft the use of ``BinaryFormatter`` with untrusted input has caused many instances of heartache, late nights, and weekend work trying to produce a solution.\r\n\r\nIn .NET Core 1.0 we removed ``BinaryFormatter`` entirely due to its known risks, but without a clear path to using something safer customer demand brought it back to .NET Core 1.1. Since then, we have been on the path to removal, slowly turning it off by default in multiple project types but letting you opt-in via flags if you still needed it for backward compatibility. .NET 9 sees the culmination of this effort with the removal of ``BinaryFormatter``. In .NET 9 these flags will no longer exist and the in-box implementation of ``BinaryFormatter`` will throw exceptions in any project type when you try to use it. However, if you are committed to using a class that cannot be made secure you will still be able to.\r\n\r\n## It's not that it’s binary\r\n\r\nWe pick on ``BinaryFormatter`` because of its ubiquitous use, but the problem is not that the payload is binary, the problem is that the payload tells .NET what objects to create. That capability is what makes ``BinaryFormatter`` so popular, you can throw pretty much any class at it, and it will serialize and deserialize it correctly without developers having to do any work. However, it is also what makes it so dangerous.\r\n\r\nThere are classes within .NET which, by design, can run arbitrary code, and if you try to deserialize those through any deserialization code that creates objects based on the payload you end up with “Remote Code Execution” (RCE), a class of security vulnerability that allows the attacker to run their own code within your application, under the privileges your application has.\r\n\r\nThis has been a known problem as far back as 2012, when the Black Hat security conference featured the canonical presentation on .NET’s version of the problem, [Are you my type? Breaking .NET through Serialization, James Forshaw](https://paper.bobylive.com/Meeting_Papers/BlackHat/USA-2012/BH_US_12_Forshaw_Are_You_My_Type_WP.pdf). There’s even a GitHub repository dedicated to hunting and showing these types of attacks in .NET, [https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net](https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net).\r\n\r\nImagine your code has a class DeleteAllMyData. If you accept a payload from untrusted input, for example a web page, an attacker can create a payload that contains an instance of DeleteAllMyData and when you deserialize that payload you will get a chance to discover if your database backups actually restore.\r\n\r\nOther .NET serialization formats (and serialization formats in other languages and frameworks) allow for class information to be passed in a payload, to pick on our own framework ``SoapFormatter``, ``LosFormatter``, ``NetDataContractSerializer`` and ``ObjectStateFormatter`` all exhibit the same dangerous characteristics.\r\n\r\nEven JSON.NET has an opt-in option to allow the creation of a payload that specifies class names, and that is a text format, not a binary one. Other JSON deserializers (both .NET and Java) suffered from the same problem, as demonstrated at Black Hat 2017, [Friday the 13th JSON Attacks, Alvaro Muñoz & Oleksandr Mirosh](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Munoz-Friday-The-13th-JSON-Attacks-wp.pdf).\r\n\r\nYour takeaway should be that there’s nothing inherently wrong with a binary payload, it’s the fact that the ``BinaryFormatter`` payload contains instructions on the classes to be created, and what should go into that class’s properties that make it so dangerous. Other serializers, including some JSON serializers, also have the same ability, making them equally dangerous to use.\r\n\r\n## Real Word Examples of BinaryFormatter security bugs\r\n\r\nWithin Microsoft, ``BinaryFormatter`` has been the cause of a quite a few security problems, including:\r\n\r\n* In Exchange, [CVE-2021-42321](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166153/Microsoft-Exchange-Server-Remote-Code-Execution.html), where a binder had a spelling mistake that led to RCE.\r\n* In Azure DevOps, [CVE-2019-1306](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2019/10/23/cve-2019-1306-are-you-my-index), where invalid MarkDown used ``BinaryFormatter`` and granted RCE.\r\n* In SharePoint, [CVE-2022-22005](https://blog.viettelcybersecurity.com/cve-2022-22005-microsoft-sharepoint-rce-2/), where loading images for charts used ``BinaryFormatter`` and once again lead to RCE.\r\n\r\nThere has been an outright ban on using ``BinaryFormatter`` for new projects at Microsoft for years, and an ongoing effort to remove it from older code for almost as long as the usage ban in new code. We have added code analyzers, warnings, and public documentation, and yet still we see people using it and ending up with RCE bugs. It feels like we need to do more.\r\n\r\n## BinaryFormatter is not fixable\r\n\r\n``BinaryFormatter`` has other problems around algorithmic complexity, unbounded cache growth, and unintended object graph edge manipulation. If we take out one insecure piece, replace it with a secure piece, and keep going until all the insecure pieces are replaced there is not much of the original ``BinaryFormatter`` left. A secure version would have a vastly different API shape and it could not be a drop-in replacement. It would require massive refactoring of application code to use, so, really, would it even be ``BinaryFormatter`` anymore?\r\n\r\nSerialization binders, a type of class used to inspect types during deserialization, are often proposed as a control mechanism to stop ``BinaryFormatter`` doing bad things, but there are code paths in ``BinaryFormatter`` that bypass binders by design, and writing a correct binder that isn’t vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack is extremely hard.\r\n\r\n## The plan for .NET 9\r\n\r\nFor the last few .NET releases newly introduced project types such as Blazor or MAUI projects have been unable to use ``BinaryFormatter`` at all. ASP.NET projects are particularly vulnerable as their entire purpose is to take untrusted input and were also part of the ban. For some, older, project types you have been able to opt into using ``BinaryFormatter`` by setting a flag.\r\n\r\nOur current intentions are:\r\n\r\n1. The in-box implementation of ``BinaryFormatter`` will throw exceptions when you try to use it, even if you set any of the settings that previously enabled its use. We are also removing these settings.\r\n2. A new NuGet package will be provided, (with a suitable name like Microsoft.Unsupported.BinaryFormatter) which you could add to your projects. With a small config change in your app, ``BinaryFormatter`` will appear again, which is useful if you judge the risk of ``BinaryFormatter`` acceptable for your use cases. This NuGet package will be permanently marked as vulnerable so that dependency and code scanners can detect ``BinaryFormatter`` usage easily.\r\n3. We will also provide a safe reader in its own NuGet package. This reader will allow you to read a ``BinaryFormatter`` payload and it will return an object graph describing the payload. Each node in the graph will represent an object in the payload and each edge represents a reference between objects.\r\n\r\nThe safe reader will allow you to evaluate the classes within a ``BinaryFormatter`` payload, providing a representation of the object graph with each node containing information on the object type, and a list of its fields and their values. The node structure we are considering looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class Node\r\n{\r\n    public SomeTypeDescriptor ObjectType;\r\n    public Dictionary<string, object> Fields;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will use a new class for the object type descriptor (whose name is yet to be decided) to impede naïve developers calling ``Type.GetType(theNodeType)`` and reintroducing the same fundamentally insecure behavior that we are trying to stop.\r\n\r\nSay you had had a class ``Customer`` and a class ``Address``, and your customer had a ``ShippingAddress`` and ``BillingAddress``, both of which are properties in the customer class, with a type of ``Address``. The fields within the ``Customer`` object node would be something like ``{ \"ShippingAddress\", node_for_ship_addr }`` and ``{ \"BillingAddress\", node_for_bill_addr }``.\r\n\r\nThis graph will allow you to both validate the types in the payload against types you are expecting and provide data you can use to rehydrate your objects.\r\n\r\n## Preparing for migration\r\n\r\nTo migrate away from ``BinaryFormatter`` is going to take work. There is no drop-in replacement, nor is there a single path that fits everyone because everyone’s classes are different and there are too many varied use cases.\r\n\r\nThe first step to migrating away from ``BinaryFormatter`` should be selecting a new serialization format. Remember that binary representation is safe if the produced payload does not instruct the deserialization process to create types. The same restriction applies to text-based formats.\r\n\r\nAt Microsoft, a lot of teams have moved from ``BinaryFormatter`` to ``[ProtoBuf](https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/csharptutorial/)`` (you will even see some familiar names in the commit history for the C# version). Other teams, whose data is text and where textual representation have advantages like easy searching have moved to JSON.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of choices out there, but we cannot pick a winner for you. Each potential serializer has pluses and minuses, and how you weigh these is a decision only you can make for your application. Factors can include speed, memory consumption, storage costs, whether it is human readable, whether it is standards based and so on.\r\n\r\nThe ideal safe use of the proposed SafeReader class is to perform conversions of existing data into your chosen new serialization format and run this conversion in as much isolation as possible, for example a virtual machine or a container, again analyzing the types in each payload, rehydrating objects, and then reserializing them in your chosen serialization format.\r\n\r\nIf your class properties are primitive types, for example int, bool, or strings then the proposed safe reader could work as part of a replacement deserialization mechanism at runtime, leaving you to do the object rehydration once you have validated the types are those you expect.\r\n\r\nOr, if you accept the risk of Remote Code Execution, or, if you are sure that no-one can tamper with your messages or data (such a promise is extremely hard to make for online systems or for desktop or mobile apps) then you might consider using the proposed NuGet package. If you choose to take this route, please remember that this package is unsupported. We will not fix security issues in ``BinaryFormatter``.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nIf you are using ``BinaryFormatter`` now you should start looking at alternative serialization formats and decide what works for you in your specific circumstance, be it saved object graphs, network transports, temporary round tripped data, or any other type of data.\r\nYou should look at all your saved data and plan to convert any data serialized by ``BinaryFormatter`` into the new serialization format you have chosen.\r\n\r\nYou should evaluate how much backwards compatibility you need, and how long you need it for.\r\n\r\nFinally, you need to get off ``BinaryFormatter``, it is too dangerous to use any more and that is why it is leaving the .NET runtime.\r\n\r\n[Discussion Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/98245)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/293","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"BinaryFormatter is being removed in .NET 9\" (#293)"},{"Id":"2072888869","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T18:00:52","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"292","RawContent":null,"Title":" Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-0056: Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient SQL Data provider Information Disclosure Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-0056: Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient SQL Data provider Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET's System.Data.SqlClient and Microsoft.Data.SqlClient NuGet Packages.

The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.

Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.

This shift is intended to make it easier for Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) customers to choose whether to allow .NET 6 and beyond on their environments, without the side effects a key shared between multiple products might have.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nToday Microsoft signs .NET artifacts with a variety of certificates. For example, NuGet packages, 3rd party binaries redistributed with .NET, Visual Studio extension packages, and some specialized debugging related binaries all have different certificates. The most common certificate is **Microsoft Corporation**, with issuer **Microsoft Code Signing PCA 2011** and thumbprint **abdca79af9dd48a0ea702ad45260b3c03093fb4b**, used to sign most executable files. .NET is switching to **.NET**, with issuer **Microsoft Code Signing PCA 2011** and thumbprint **60ff375e5669b98d43ea0e2328e618cf73c0f91d**.\r\n\r\nNot all binaries signed with **Microsoft Corporation** are shifting to the new certificate. .NET repackages a variety of assets from previous releases (e.g. targeting packs), and those will not change. Only newly built .NET 6 binaries will get the new certificate. Some tooling utilized in Visual Studio will remain on the existing cert.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n---\r\nQuestions or concerns?

This removal effectively breaks NuGet package signing verification, which has the result of breaking the ability to restore NuGet packages.\r\n\r\nThis break in behavior is only observed with .NET 5 and .NET 6, which have NuGet package verification enabled (and it cannot be disabled). [NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56) has been observed on some distros already and we expect it to become pervasive quickly as more distros are updated to include more recent version of `NSS` and `ca-certificates` (with the VeriSign CA removed). We are in the process of releasing updated builds of .NET 5 and .NET 6 that have NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\nWe need developers, companies, and commercial providers to install (or otherwise use) updated builds of .NET 5 and .NET 6 if you rely on those .NET versions on Linux. If you adopt the updated .NET versions soon, you should not observe a break in functional behavior, and will be able to confidently update to newer versions of `NSS` and `ca-certificates` packages.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your feedback on this topic and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10712\r\n\r\n## Updated .NET builds\r\n\r\nNew .NET builds will be provided with NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS. The following are the expected release dates:\r\n\r\n- .NET SDK 5.0.202 -- April 6, 2021.\r\n- .NET 6 Preview 3 -- April 8, 2021.\r\n\r\nNew [container images](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet) will be published for Alpine, Debian, and Ubuntu on both of these dates, for the respective releases.\r\n\r\nThese builds include significant additional functionality beyond disabling NuGet package verification. We originally planned to release these builds as regular releases for all supported operating systems and architectures, targeting April 13th. We made two changes from our original release plan: earlier release dates and include the change in NuGet functionality for Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\n## Who is affected\r\n\r\n.NET 5+ users will be affected on any operating system that has removed the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority`. We are maintaining a list of [Linux distros that are known to be affected](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56).\r\n\r\n`nuget.exe` is sometimes used on Linux with Mono. This scenario is not affected.\r\n\r\nThere has been an [industry-wide movement to distrust the VeriSign root CA](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/03/12/distrust-symantec-tls-certificates/), including companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla. This may mean that at anytime in the future, [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212140) and [Microsoft](https://ccadb-public.secure.force.com/microsoft/IncludedCACertificateReportForMSFT) can remove `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority` from their trusted root CA list.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe NuGet team has [disabled the package verification feature](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/3979) for macOS and Linux. If needed, we will disable the feature for Windows at a later time. This change will be available in the updated .NET builds covered earlier.\r\n\r\nWe are also [talking to some Linux distro package maintainers](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/ca-certificates/-/issues/1) to ask them to delay the removal of the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority` (for code signing only). Even a month of grace would help a lot, to enable .NET users on Linux to adopt the newer .NET 5 and .NET 6 builds.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, this change does not affect .NET Core 3.1 and earlier versions. It does not affect .NET Framework. It does not affect any .NET functionality on Windows, at least not at this time.\r\n\r\n## More Context\r\n\r\nWe observed [NuGet Restore Issues on Debian Family Linux Distros](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/49) in January, 2021. This led us to discover that there has been an industry-wide movement to remove the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority`.\r\n\r\nNuGet has historically relied on two key certificates:\r\n\r\n- NuGet Microsoft Author Signing Certificate Update - Expired January 27th, 2021\r\n- NuGet.org Repository Signing Certificate Update - Expires April 14th, 2021\r\n\r\nAfter those certificates expire, the NuGet client falls back to [timestamp verification](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/reference/signed-packages-reference), which enables package verification to still function. The timestamp verification relies on VeriSign root certificate authority. The absence of this root certificate authority being available on a machine means that timestamp verification is no longer functional, which causes package signature verification to fail.\r\n\r\nSecurity is very important to us. We are putting together a plan to use a new system that will allow us to re-enable package signing verification on all supported operating systems. We will have more to share on our future plans once we are sure that all systems are once again functional.\r\n\r\n[.NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56) provides more details on error messages, affected environments, and solutions."},{"Id":"15752631045","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-30T21:15:03","Actor":"terrajobst","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/179","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Preserve git refspec to local patches and branches after renamed origin's master\" (#179) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"For all those who can't pull `master`, it should have renamed to `main`.\r\n\r\nTo preserve refspec to patches and branches, just changing the `heads/master` to `heads/main` should work.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n[remote \"origin\"]\r\n\turl = https://github.com/dotnet/your-repo\r\n-\tfetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n+\tfetch = +refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n\ttagopt = --no-tags\r\n[branch \"master\"]\r\n\tremote = origin\r\n-\tmerge = refs/heads/master\r\n+\tmerge = refs/heads/main\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Putting this out there, if anyone else facing similar issue with git."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreCLR":{"Events":[{"Id":"16327127641","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-05-12T03:16:46","Actor":"hoyosjs","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28065","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"[3.1] build.sh skipcrossgen failed\" (#28065) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"dotnet/runtime has a new build system and I cannot reproduce this issue with dotnet/runtime.

[dotnet/sqlclient#1042](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/1042) to fix below issue in System.Data.SqlClient:\r\n- [dotnet/sqlclient#729](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues/729) System.Data.SqlClient 4.8.2 throws TransactionAbortedException (the connection has been broken)\r\n- Premier customer support: [Devdiv Ticket 1245724 ](https://devdiv.visualstudio.com/DevDiv/_workitems/edit/1245724 )\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nA race condition exists between \"Single Phase Commit\" and \"Transaction Ended\" as both are triggered externally by delegated SqlTransaction. With new changes to doom connection in \"Transaction Ended\" Event (https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42937), \"Commit\" started failing intermittently leading to this issue. Dooming connection is essential to prevent connection re-use that leads to security issues, so that PR is valid and important.\r\n\r\nBut as a consequence, \"Commit\"'s inconsistent locking leads to this problem. Locking is essential in this part of code, but in \"Single Phase Commit\" implementation, late and split locking causes issues between Commit and Abort event handling, leading to intermittent \"Transaction Aborted Exception\".\r\n\r\nThis change in lock scope fixes the issue. It wasn't easily reproducible in Microsoft.Data.SqlClient but happens very often with System.Data.SqlClient 4.8.2 due to slow performance. Making test-case more rigorous and forcing latency while debugging aided in reproducing this issue.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n❗ **Critical**: Premier customer application is impacted due to this issue _(followed via Emails)_.\r\n### Regression?\r\n**Yes**: Issue started occurring since System.Data.SqlClient v4.8.2 (PR #42937)\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nIt's not possible to add test case for this behavior since it's a race condition scenario and is greatly influenced by MS DTC that manages delegated transaction completion.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n**Low**: This PR does not introduce any critical design changes, but only makes changes in lock scope.\r\nIssue has been verified by customers as well as with the repro apps available in issue [#729](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues/729)\r\n\r\n\r\ncc: @danmoseley @saurabh500 @David-Engel \r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Roslyn":{"Events":[{"Id":"16327471495","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-05-12T04:08:26","Actor":"msftbot[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/53350","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Merge release/dev17.0-preview1-vs-deps to main-vs-deps\" (#53350) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"\nThis is an automatically generated pull request from release/dev17.0-preview1-vs-deps into main-vs-deps.\n\n\nOnce all conflicts are resolved and all the tests pass, you are free to merge the pull request. 🐯\n\n## Troubleshooting conflicts\n\n### Identify authors of changes which introduced merge conflicts\nScroll to the bottom, then for each file containing conflicts copy its path into the following searches:\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/release/dev17.0-preview1-vs-deps\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/main-vs-deps\n\nUsually the most recent change to a file between the two branches is considered to have introduced the conflicts, but sometimes it will be necessary to look for the conflicting lines and check the blame in each branch.

One of them is an exception related to adding a duplicate key to a Dictionary in the AssemblyDependencyResolver. Alternatively, they might get an exception about the assembly having already been found with a different extension.

This one was added during .NET Core 5.0 development but there is a customer need to also have it in the .NET Core 3.1 release.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the `-pie` linker option was missing and while the code was being compiled as Position Independent, the executables weren't, and therefore ASLR was not applied to them. This resulted in them being loaded to fixed addresses, which might potentially open vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThis port also automates the appliance of the `-fPIC/-fPIE` settings to all targets from a single centralized setting called `CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`, which allows CMake to apply the appropriate compiler options without further need of manual specification.\r\n\r\n# Customer Impact\r\nHaving these flags enabled provides the built binaries with an additional layer of security, which has become a necessary requirement for some compliance checks, as well as safer applications overall. This port was requested by teams in Azure.\r\n\r\n# Regression\r\nThis was not a regression.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\nThe [checksec](https://github.com/slimm609/checksec.sh) tool was used to verify the

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly \r\n                 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0\"\r\n\r\n2.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help.

Making test-case more rigorous and forcing latency while debugging aided in reproducing this issue.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n❗ **Critical**: Premier customer application is impacted due to this issue _(followed via Emails)_.\r\n### Regression?\r\n**Yes**: Issue started occurring since System.Data.SqlClient v4.8.2 (PR #42937)\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nIt's not possible to add test case for this behavior since it's a race condition scenario and is greatly influenced by MS DTC that manages delegated transaction completion.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n**Low**: This PR does not introduce any critical design changes, but only makes changes in lock scope.\r\nIssue has been verified by customers as well as with the repro apps available in issue [#729](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues/729)\r\n\r\n\r\ncc: @danmoseley @saurabh500 @David-Engel \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43070","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[Release/3.1] Fix race condition issues between SinglePhaseCommit and TransactionEnded events\" (#43070)"},{"Id":"868239289","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-06T19:10:27","Actor":"cheenamalhotra","Number":"43069","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Release/3.1] Fix wrong data blended with transactions in .NET Core","State":"closed","Body":"Ports dotnet/sqlclient#1023 to fix a critical issue that also exists in System.Data.SqlClient:\r\n- Fixes [#980](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues/980) SqlDataReader returns stale data\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nWhen working with delegated transactions, completing a transaction with open resultset leads to data corruption in the connection instance that's sent back to connection pool.

StaticField1;\r\n    public static int StaticField2;\r\n    public static float StaticField3;\r\n\r\n    [ThreadStatic]\r\n    public static int ThreadStaticField1;\r\n\r\n    static Class1()\r\n    {\r\n        StaticField1 = \"statically nice!\";\r\n        StaticField2 = 10;\r\n        StaticField3 = 3.56f;\r\n        ThreadStaticField1 = 56;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n.....\r\n\r\npublic static void DoFields()\r\n{\r\n    Class1 class1 = new Class1();\r\n    class1.Field1 = \"nice\";\r\n    class1.Field2 = 23;\r\n    class1.Field3 = 2.5f;\r\n\r\n    Console.WriteLine(class1.Field1);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(class1.Field2);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(class1.Field3);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic static void DoStaticFields()\r\n{\r\n    Console.WriteLine(Class1.StaticField1);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(String.Empty);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(Class1.StaticField2);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(Class1.StaticField3);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(Class1.ThreadStaticField1);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe interpreter will happily load instance and static fields on both dynamically loaded types and types compiled into the native executable, while ensuring that static constructors have been run in both cases.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/8351","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[Interpreter]

This shift is intended to make it easier for Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) customers to choose whether to allow .NET 6 and beyond on their environments, without the side effects a key shared between multiple products might have.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nToday Microsoft signs .NET artifacts with a variety of certificates. For example, NuGet packages, 3rd party binaries redistributed with .NET, Visual Studio extension packages, and some specialized debugging related binaries all have different certificates. The most common certificate is **Microsoft Corporation**, with issuer **Microsoft Code Signing PCA 2011** and thumbprint **abdca79af9dd48a0ea702ad45260b3c03093fb4b**, used to sign most executable files. .NET is switching to **.NET**, with issuer **Microsoft Code Signing PCA 2011** and thumbprint **60ff375e5669b98d43ea0e2328e618cf73c0f91d**.\r\n\r\nNot all binaries signed with **Microsoft Corporation** are shifting to the new certificate. .NET repackages a variety of assets from previous releases (e.g. targeting packs), and those will not change. Only newly built .NET 6 binaries will get the new certificate. Some tooling utilized in Visual Studio will remain on the existing cert.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n---\r\nQuestions or concerns?

This removal effectively breaks NuGet package signing verification, which has the result of breaking the ability to restore NuGet packages.\r\n\r\nThis break in behavior is only observed with .NET 5 and .NET 6, which have NuGet package verification enabled (and it cannot be disabled). [NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56) has been observed on some distros already and we expect it to become pervasive quickly as more distros are updated to include more recent version of `NSS` and `ca-certificates` (with the VeriSign CA removed). We are in the process of releasing updated builds of .NET 5 and .NET 6 that have NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\nWe need developers, companies, and commercial providers to install (or otherwise use) updated builds of .NET 5 and .NET 6 if you rely on those .NET versions on Linux. If you adopt the updated .NET versions soon, you should not observe a break in functional behavior, and will be able to confidently update to newer versions of `NSS` and `ca-certificates` packages.\r\n\r\nUpdates: \r\n- [NuGet repository signature certificate will expire on April 14th, 2021](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/58)\r\n- [.NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions using NSS or ca-certificates](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/net-5-nuget-restore-failures-on-linux-distributions-using-nss-or-ca-certificates/) (NuGet blog)\r\n- [.NET April 2021 Updates – 5.0.5](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-april-2021-updates/) (.NET blog)\r\n- [.NET 6 Preview 3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6-preview-3/)\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your feedback on this topic and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10712\r\n\r\n## Updated .NET builds\r\n\r\nNew .NET builds will be provided with NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS. The following are the expected release dates:\r\n\r\n- [.NET SDK 5.0.202](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) -- April 6, 2021.\r\n- [.NET 6 Preview 3](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) -- April 8, 2021.\r\n\r\nNew [container images](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet) will be published for Alpine, Debian, and Ubuntu on both of these dates, for the respective releases.\r\n\r\nThese builds include significant additional functionality beyond disabling NuGet package verification. We originally planned to release these builds as regular releases for all supported operating systems and architectures, targeting April 13th. We made two changes from our original release plan: earlier release dates and include the change in NuGet functionality for Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\n## Who is affected\r\n\r\n.NET 5+ users will be affected on any operating system that has removed the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority`. We are maintaining a list of [Linux distros that are known to be affected](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56).\r\n\r\n`nuget.exe` is sometimes used on Linux with Mono. This scenario is not affected.\r\n\r\nThere has been an [industry-wide movement to distrust the VeriSign root CA](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/03/12/distrust-symantec-tls-certificates/), including companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla. This may mean that at anytime in the future, [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212140) and [Microsoft](https://ccadb-public.secure.force.com/microsoft/IncludedCACertificateReportForMSFT) can remove `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority` from their trusted root CA list.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe NuGet team has [disabled the package verification feature](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/3979) for macOS and Linux. If needed, we will disable the feature for Windows at a later time. This change will be available in the updated .NET builds covered earlier.\r\n\r\nWe are also [talking to some Linux distro package maintainers](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/ca-certificates/-/issues/1) to ask them to delay the removal of the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority` (for code signing only). Even a month of grace would help a lot, to enable .NET users on Linux to adopt the newer .NET 5 and .NET 6 builds.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, this change does not affect .NET Core 3.1 and earlier versions. It does not affect .NET Framework. It does not affect any .NET functionality on Windows, at least not at this time.\r\n\r\n## More Context\r\n\r\nWe observed [NuGet Restore Issues on Debian Family Linux Distros](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/49) in January, 2021. This led us to discover that there has been an industry-wide movement to remove the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority`.\r\n\r\nNuGet has historically relied on two key certificates:\r\n\r\n- NuGet Microsoft Author Signing Certificate Update - Expired January 27th, 2021\r\n- NuGet.org Repository Signing Certificate Update - Expires April 14th, 2021\r\n\r\nAfter those certificates expire, the NuGet client falls back to [timestamp verification](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/reference/signed-packages-reference), which enables package verification to still function. The timestamp verification relies on VeriSign root certificate authority. The absence of this root certificate authority being available on a machine means that timestamp verification is no longer functional, which causes package signature verification to fail.\r\n\r\nSecurity is very important to us. We are putting together a plan to use a new system that will allow us to re-enable package signing verification on all supported operating systems. We will have more to share on our future plans once we are sure that all systems are once again functional.\r\n\r\n[.NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56) provides more details on error messages, affected environments, and solutions.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/180","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"NuGet package restore broken on .NET 5+ with Removal of Trust of VeriSign CA\" (#180)"},{"Id":"837071846","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-30T21:15:03","Actor":"Nirmal4G","Number":"179","RawContent":null,"Title":"Preserve git refspec to local patches and branches after renamed origin's master","State":"closed","Body":"For all those who can't pull `master`, it should have renamed to `main`.\r\n\r\nTo preserve refspec to patches and branches, just changing the `heads/master` to `heads/main` should work.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n[remote \"origin\"]\r\n\turl = https://github.com/dotnet/your-repo\r\n-\tfetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n+\tfetch = +refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n\ttagopt = --no-tags\r\n[branch \"master\"]\r\n\tremote = origin\r\n-\tmerge = refs/heads/master\r\n+\tmerge = refs/heads/main\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Putting this out there, if anyone else facing similar issue with git.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/179","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Preserve git refspec to local patches and branches after renamed origin's master\" (#179)"},{"Id":"826383777","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-09T18:01:29","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"178","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-26701 | .NET Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-26701 | .NET Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 5.0, .NET Core 3.1, and .NET Core 2.1.

All new repos will already use this naming. Over the next couple of months, we're going to rename the branches in our existing repos as well. We're using [GitHub's new tooling](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-01-19-support-for-renaming-an-existing-branch/) to make sure branch policies and PRs are automatically updated.\r\n\r\nHowever, this still requires some changes from you as well. This announcement describes the process and what you need to do on your end.\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a smaller list of repos and grow from there. Theses are the planned starting repos:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/project-system](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system) ✔ \r\n* [dotnet/llvm-project](https://github.com/dotnet/llvm-project) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/icu](https://github.com/dotnet/icu) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/xharness](https://github.com/dotnet/xharness) ✔\r\n* [mono/linker](https://github.com/mono/linker) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/docker-tools](https://github.com/dotnet/docker-tools) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/wcf](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/iot](https://github.com/dotnet/iot) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms) ✔\r\n\r\nWe're starting with a smaller list to ensure we catch all cases where we need to update corresponding configuration in our Arcade-based tooling (see [this fantastic blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/) on how we build .NET).\r\n\r\nOnce we have validated our checklist, each repo admin will rename the default branch at their own pace. We expect to complete all repos in the next couple of months.\r\n\r\n## What you can expect\r\n\r\n*We have a detailed guide you can find at <https://aka.ms/m2m-dotnet>. This is only the essentials.*\r\n\r\nWe'll add a sticky issue to each repo when we're about to rename the branch. We'll do this a few days before and we'll leave it there for two weeks.\r\n\r\n**You don't need to update your PRs**. If you submitted a PR against the old default branch, the GitHub tooling will automatically retarget your PR against the new default branch (main).\r\n\r\nFor sanity, **you should rename the default branch in your fork as well**. When you go to your fork, GitHub will guide you through this experience:\r\n\r\n![Rename branch in fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/105210186-92bdba80-5aff-11eb-99c9-0beb708fcf3f.png)\r\n\r\n**You will need to update the repos you cloned to your hard drive**.

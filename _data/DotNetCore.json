This removal effectively breaks NuGet package signing verification, which has the result of breaking the ability to restore NuGet packages.\r\n\r\nThis break in behavior is only observed with .NET 5 and .NET 6, which have NuGet package verification enabled (and it cannot be disabled). [NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56) has been observed on some distros already and we expect it to become pervasive quickly as more distros are updated to include more recent version of `NSS` and `ca-certificates` (with the VeriSign CA removed). We are in the process of releasing updated builds of .NET 5 and .NET 6 that have NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\nWe need developers, companies, and commercial providers to install (or otherwise use) updated builds of .NET 5 and .NET 6 if you rely on those .NET versions on Linux. If you adopt the updated .NET versions soon, you should not observe a break in functional behavior, and will be able to confidently update to newer versions of `NSS` and `ca-certificates` packages.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your feedback on this topic and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10712\r\n\r\n## Updated .NET builds\r\n\r\nNew .NET builds will be provided with NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS. The following are the expected release dates:\r\n\r\n- .NET SDK 5.0.202 -- April 6, 2021.\r\n- .NET 6 Preview 3 -- April 8, 2021.\r\n\r\nNew [container images](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet) will be published for Alpine, Debian, and Ubuntu on both of these dates, for the respective releases.\r\n\r\nThese builds include significant additional functionality beyond disabling NuGet package verification. We originally planned to release these builds as regular releases for all supported operating systems and architectures, targeting April 13th. We made two changes from our original release plan: earlier release dates and include the change in NuGet functionality for Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\n## Who is affected\r\n\r\n.NET 5+ users will be affected on any operating system that has removed the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority`. We are maintaining a list of [Linux distros that are known to be affected](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56).\r\n\r\n`nuget.exe` is sometimes used on Linux with Mono. This scenario is not affected.\r\n\r\nThere has been an [industry-wide movement to distrust the VeriSign root CA](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/03/12/distrust-symantec-tls-certificates/), including companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla. This may mean that at anytime in the future, [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212140) and [Microsoft](https://ccadb-public.secure.force.com/microsoft/IncludedCACertificateReportForMSFT) can remove `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority` from their trusted root CA list.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe NuGet team has [disabled the package verification feature](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/3979) for macOS and Linux. If needed, we will disable the feature for Windows at a later time. This change will be available in the updated .NET builds covered earlier.\r\n\r\nWe are also [talking to some Linux distro package maintainers](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/ca-certificates/-/issues/1) to ask them to delay the removal of the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority` (for code signing only). Even a month of grace would help a lot, to enable .NET users on Linux to adopt the newer .NET 5 and .NET 6 builds.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, this change does not affect .NET Core 3.1 and earlier versions. It does not affect .NET Framework. It does not affect any .NET functionality on Windows, at least not at this time.\r\n\r\n## More Context\r\n\r\nWe observed [NuGet Restore Issues on Debian Family Linux Distros](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/49) in January, 2021. This led us to discover that there has been an industry-wide movement to remove the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority`.\r\n\r\nNuGet has historically relied on two key certificates:\r\n\r\n- NuGet Microsoft Author Signing Certificate Update - Expired January 27th, 2021\r\n- NuGet.org Repository Signing Certificate Update - Expires April 14th, 2021\r\n\r\nAfter those certificates expire, the NuGet client falls back to [timestamp verification](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/reference/signed-packages-reference), which enables package verification to still function. The timestamp verification relies on VeriSign root certificate authority. The absence of this root certificate authority being available on a machine means that timestamp verification is no longer functional, which causes package signature verification to fail.\r\n\r\nSecurity is very important to us. We are putting together a plan to use a new system that will allow us to re-enable package signing verification on all supported operating systems. We will have more to share on our future plans once we are sure that all systems are once again functional.\r\n\r\n[.NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56) provides more details on error messages, affected environments, and solutions."},{"Id":"15752631045","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-30T21:15:03","Actor":"terrajobst","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/179","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Preserve git refspec to local patches and branches after renamed origin's master\" (#179) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"For all those who can't pull `master`, it should have renamed to `main`.\r\n\r\nTo preserve refspec to patches and branches, just changing the `heads/master` to `heads/main` should work.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n[remote \"origin\"]\r\n\turl = https://github.com/dotnet/your-repo\r\n-\tfetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n+\tfetch = +refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n\ttagopt = --no-tags\r\n[branch \"master\"]\r\n\tremote = origin\r\n-\tmerge = refs/heads/master\r\n+\tmerge = refs/heads/main\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Putting this out there, if anyone else facing similar issue with git."},{"Id":"15626592773","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-21T13:01:45","Actor":"Nirmal4G","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/179","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Preserve git refspec to local patches and branches after renamed origin's master\" (#179) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"For all those who can't pull `master`, it should have renamed to `main`.\r\n\r\nTo preserve refspec to patches and branches, just changing the `heads/master` to `heads/main` should work.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n[remote \"origin\"]\r\n\turl = https://github.com/dotnet/your-repo\r\n-\tfetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n+\tfetch = +refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n\ttagopt = --no-tags\r\n[branch \"master\"]\r\n\tremote = origin\r\n-\tmerge = refs/heads/master\r\n+\tmerge = refs/heads/main\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Putting this out there, if anyone else facing similar issue with git."},{"Id":"15469684782","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-09T18:01:30","Actor":"rbhanda","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/178","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-26701 | .NET Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\" (#178) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-26701 | .NET Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 5.0, .NET Core 3.1, and .NET Core 2.1.

Some calls are significant slower if the default printer is a network printer, even if I explicit set a local printer name.\n\nAfter studying referencesource I think I found the culprit.\n\nI call:\n\nvar printerSettings = new System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings();\n\nprinterSettings.PrinterName = &quot;LOCALPRINTER&quot;;\n\n// the next call is slow if the OS default printer is a network printer\nvar res = printerSettings.DefaultPageSettings.PrinterResolution\n\nInternally FastDeviceCapabilities is called.\n\nFastDeviceCapabilities calls GetOutputPort. But GetOutput port return the port of the default printer and not the port of the given printer!\n\nIn addition, DeviceCapabilities is then called with a wrong combination of printer name and port, don't know if this could lead to additional problems.\n\nResolution: GetOutputPort should return the port of the given printer and not accessing the default printer at all.\n\nBest Regards,\nRaphael\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Raphael Affolter on 1/20/2020, 04:03 AM: \n\n<p>I forgot to mention: .Net Framework 4.6.1</p>\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 1/20/2020, 06:51 PM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly \r\n                 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0\"\r\n\r\n2. It builds fine but on app launch it crashes with:\r\n\r\n                 \"Could not load file or assembly 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51' \r\n                 or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help.

The reason to do that synchronously is because it has a `HasLoadWarnings(out IEnumerable<string> warnings)` api, and when loading assemblies it populates that array. However that array is stored for the life time of the object and if you call multiple times `LoadAssemblies` it would return the aggregate of warnings found.\r\n\r\nAlso, we might be able to do a lazy loading of the assemblies using the enumerator model if that meets the customer expectations.\r\n\r\nSome options for the context is having the user pass down a context as a parameter, that way we don't have customers accidentally cross the context boundaries and get the assembly that was previously loaded when they wanted a new assembly (assemblies are cached by name). \r\n\r\nAlso the way we are loading references might need to be improved: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/16817#discussion_r612588244\r\n\r\ncc: @ericstj @Anipik ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/16919","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ApiCompatibility.AssemblySymbolLoader design should be revisited\" (#16919)"},{"Id":"858340475","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-14T23:30:33","Actor":"safern","Number":"16918","RawContent":null,"Title":"ApiCompatibility.RuleDriver logic to load the rules and run them on the APIs should be revisited","State":"open","Body":"PR https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/16817 added the ApiCompatibility object model and currently the way the rules are executed is for every `ElementMapper` visited in the `DifferenceVisitor` we iterate every rule that we resolved via reflection and invoke `Rule.Run(ElementMapper)`. \r\n\r\nThis is the \"hot\" path of the object model and we should run numbers and see if there is a better way to do this, there might be other ways like events/hooks that might serve better.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/16817#discussion_r612602004 for more context.\r\n\r\ncc: @ericstj @Anipik ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/16918","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ApiCompatibility.RuleDriver logic to load the rules and run them on the APIs should be revisited\" (#16918)"},{"Id":"858322227","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-14T22:51:40","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"16916","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/5.0.3xx' => 'main'","State":"open","Body":"I detected changes in the release/5.0.3xx branch which have not been merged yet to main.

For .NET, we need to determine how to support .NET Arm64 and x64 builds on those OSes in a way that offers a reasonable user experience and that has reasonable cost.\r\n\r\n## Problem to solve\r\n\r\nAs stated, we need to offer x64 and Arm64 builds of .NET within one 64-bit namespace (without much help from the OS on how to manage it). That leads to three issues:\r\n\r\n- How do we separate the products in some directory structure (peer directories or unified)?\r\n- Do customers manage using the arm64 vs arm64 product via which one is in the path (or absolute paths to dotnet)?\r\n- Do the directory names represent the product in the way we want?\r\n\r\nOne could reasonable ask why we need to support coexistence once native Arm64 build are available.\r\n\r\n- We are only building .NET 6 for Apple Arm64, and people will have legitimate need to use earlier .NET versions that are x64-only.\r\n- The situation on Windows is more favorable since both .NET 5 and 6 are built for Windows Arm64, but the general problem is the same.\r\n- The point of emulation is to enable a smooth transition to Arm64. It may take some time for people to transition to Arm64. For example, someone may be able to move to .NET 6 immediately but not to Arm64 because of a native dependency.\r\n- If we decided not to solve this problem, we'd want to consider blocking the x64 installers on macOS and Windows Arm64 machines, or at least showing a warning that there are unsolved problems that the user will likely run into.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nThe Windows and macOS plans and implementations are similar but have key differences, per our understanding.\r\n\r\n\t- Same: No WoW64 subsystem or Program Files (x64) style experience. For example, there is no x64 command prompt.\r\n\t- Same: An executable can be universal.\r\n\t- Different: macOS universal executables are transparently restartable, while Windows ones are not.\r\n\t- Different: Windows x64 emulation is here to stay, while macOS x64 emulation will probably be removed in 3-5 years.\r\n\r\nThe following are various high-level solutions that we could employ, with pros and cons.\r\n\r\n## Status quo\r\n\r\nOn Windows x64, .NET is installed to two locations (depending on architecture):\r\n\r\n\t- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\r\n\t- C:\\Program Files (x86)\\dotnet\r\n\r\nToday, customers need one of those two directories in the path in order to get the \"dotnet\" experience they want, like if they want a 32-bit or 64-bit \"dotnet build\".\r\n\r\nNote: There will not be a C:\\Program Files (x64) directory on Windows Arm64. We are expected to install 64-bit products (Intel and/or Arm based) in C:\\Program Files.\r\n\r\nOn macOS, .NET is installed to one location:\r\n\r\n\t- /usr/local/share/dotnet \r\n\r\n## Going forward\r\nThere will be one dotnet in the path, just like today. Much like the 32- and 64-bit support we offer on Windows, we'll offer both Arm64 and x64 builds of .NET and customers can install both or either, and can control which is in the `PATH`. That will determine if they get an Arm64 or x64 dotnet build. We are not planning on building a .NET version manager that enables switching which architecture you get. We intend to rely on the `PATH`.\r\n\r\nThe question is what structure we offer for the two 64-bit products, how intuitive that is (now and later) and how expensive that is for us to offer.\r\n\r\n### Native dotnet\r\n\r\nPremise: there is a \"dotnet\" directory on every OS, and it is the native architecture.\r\n\r\nWe'd end up with the following, on Windows and macOS, respectively:\r\n\r\n- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\r\n- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet_x64\r\n- /usr/local/share/dotnet \r\n- /usr/local/share/dotnet_x64\r\n\r\nThis is the usual \"who gets the good name\" problem. \r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n- The dotnet directory is the native architecture on all Oses.\r\n- This option is particularly beneficial for macOS, since we expect x64 emulation to be taken away relatively quickly, at which point dotnet_x64 would disappear on that OS.\r\n\r\n**Cons:**\r\n- x64 directories on x64 and Arm64 machines no longer match.\r\n- x64 installers needs to change, including for 3.1 and 5.0. Hopefully, a single install can install to dotnet on an x64 machine and dotnet_x64 on an Arm64 machine. If not, we need a second set of x64 installers. That's likely untenable.\r\n- We have to break, migrate or somehow manage existing x64 .NET installs on Apple Silicon machines.\r\n\r\n### Archify dotnet\r\n\r\nPremise: fully embrace multi-arch support, with arch-specific directories.\r\n\r\nWe'd end up with the following:\r\n\r\n- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet_arm64\r\n- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet_x64\r\n- /usr/local/share/dotnet _arm64\r\n- /usr/local/share/dotnet _x64\r\n\r\nOn Arm64, we'd have these arch-specific directories. This is the \"no one gets the good name option; everybody loses\" option.\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n- The directories are all self-descriptive and symmetrical.\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\n- Same cons as \"Native dotnet\"\r\n- Install directories on Windows x64 and Windows Arm64 don't match.\r\n- We're stuck with dotnet_arm64 on macOS forever, even though that's the only architecture supported (in the long run).\r\n\r\n### Hide architecture differences\r\n\r\nPremise: These differences don't need to be so apparent. We already have version folders under dotnet. We can add arch folders (or something similar). This option has a lot of sub-options, too.\r\n\r\n**Option 1** -- Insert a new folder, with discrete .NET hives underneath:\r\n\r\n- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet/arm64\r\n- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet/x64\r\n- /usr/local/share/dotnet/arm64\r\n- /usr/local/share/dotnet/x64\r\n\r\n**Option 2** -- Intermix architectures in one structure (here, just shown with Windows, for simplicity):\r\n\r\n- For \"dotnet\"\r\n\t- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet/arm64/dotnet\r\n\t- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet/x64/dotnet \r\n- For frameworks\r\n\t- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared_arm64\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\6.0.0-preview.3.21181.6\\\r\n\t- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared_x64\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\6.0.0-preview.3.21181.6\\\r\n\r\nPut \"x64\" and \"arm64\" somewhere in the folder hierarchy. Where it is, is an implementation decision. It is the same (in spirit) as C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework and C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework64.\r\n\r\n**Option 3** -- Arm64 is native architecture with x64 intermixed in:\r\n\r\n- For \"dotnet\"\r\n\t- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet/dotnet\r\n\t- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet/x64/dotnet \r\n- For frameworks\r\n\t- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\6.0.0-preview.3.21181.6\\\r\n\t- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared_x64\\Microsoft.NETCore.App\\6.0.0-preview.3.21181.6\\\r\n\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n- We can manage Arm64 and x64 builds within a single structure in a way that we see as best, both now and over time.\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\n- Same cons as \"Native dotnet\"\r\n\r\n### Hide architectural differences with universal binaries\r\n\r\nBoth Windows and macOS offer a form of universal binaries, which we could use as a multiplexer between the two 64bit products. There are two problems with that.\r\n\r\n- We don't have enough information in all scenarios to know which architecture is the right one.\r\n- The Windows implementation (per our understanding) isn't as feature rich as we'd need to make all scenarios work, like debuggers.\r\n\r\nWe're rejecting this option for now. We could decide to adopt this solution on macOS and not Windows, should feedback push us in that direction.\r\n\r\n### Compatibility Wins\r\n\r\nPremise: People have already installed .NET x64 on Apple Silicon machines. We need to respect that. This is the opposite of \"Native dotnet\"\r\n\r\nWe'd end up with the following:\r\n\r\n- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet_arm64\r\n- C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\r\n- /usr/local/share/dotnet _arm64\r\n- /usr/local/share/dotnet\r\n\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n- Good compatibility for existing Apple Silicon .NET users.\r\n\r\n**Cons:**\r\n- Windows doesn't necessarily need this solution. We can change .NET before it ships with x64 support.\r\n- x64 gets the \"good name\" forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Hard design questions\r\n\r\n- **Developer UX**\r\n  - Would it be good enough to only have the platform native dotnet available on `PATH` by default (Native Dotnet solution above)? \r\n  - On Windows x64 the native .NET is typically the one on the `PATH` is already the case since typically only the x64 dotnet is on `PATH`, but it's possible to use it to build, run and test x86 apps.\r\n- **User UX**\r\n  - can we fully rely on apphost to solve the problem of picking the right archtiecture to run the app with? Different way to ask this: How common is it to run applications via \"dotnet app.dll\"?\r\n  - Is it possible to release new versions of downlevel installers (3.1 and 5) for macOS x64 and Windows x64 which would be ARM64 aware and could move the default location of the downlevel runtimes?\r\n  - How hard is it to create an x64 installer which can detect that it runs on ARM64 hardware and can change behavior based on that? This is dependent on the installer technology on Windows and macOS.\r\n\r\n## Other considerations\r\n\r\n- We probably need a `DOTNET_ROOT(x64)`, which would be analogous to the existing [`DOTNET(x86)` ENV](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet#environment-variables).\r\n- [Installers should be aware of multi-arch OSes and warn users as appropriate](https://github.com/dotnet/installer/issues/10192)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/16896","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"RFC: dotnet [Arm64 | x64] coexistence\" (#16896)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Announcements-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"851621247","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-06T17:01:00","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"181","RawContent":null,"Title":"April 2021 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released in April 2021.

This removal effectively breaks NuGet package signing verification, which has the result of breaking the ability to restore NuGet packages.\r\n\r\nThis break in behavior is only observed with .NET 5 and .NET 6, which have NuGet package verification enabled (and it cannot be disabled). [NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56) has been observed on some distros already and we expect it to become pervasive quickly as more distros are updated to include more recent version of `NSS` and `ca-certificates` (with the VeriSign CA removed). We are in the process of releasing updated builds of .NET 5 and .NET 6 that have NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\nWe need developers, companies, and commercial providers to install (or otherwise use) updated builds of .NET 5 and .NET 6 if you rely on those .NET versions on Linux. If you adopt the updated .NET versions soon, you should not observe a break in functional behavior, and will be able to confidently update to newer versions of `NSS` and `ca-certificates` packages.\r\n\r\nUpdates: \r\n- [NuGet repository signature certificate will expire on April 14th, 2021](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/58)\r\n- [.NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions using NSS or ca-certificates](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/net-5-nuget-restore-failures-on-linux-distributions-using-nss-or-ca-certificates/) (NuGet blog)\r\n- [.NET April 2021 Updates – 5.0.5](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-april-2021-updates/) (.NET blog)\r\n- [.NET 6 Preview 3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6-preview-3/)\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your feedback on this topic and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10712\r\n\r\n## Updated .NET builds\r\n\r\nNew .NET builds will be provided with NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS. The following are the expected release dates:\r\n\r\n- [.NET SDK 5.0.202](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) -- April 6, 2021.\r\n- [.NET 6 Preview 3](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) -- April 8, 2021.\r\n\r\nNew [container images](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet) will be published for Alpine, Debian, and Ubuntu on both of these dates, for the respective releases.\r\n\r\nThese builds include significant additional functionality beyond disabling NuGet package verification. We originally planned to release these builds as regular releases for all supported operating systems and architectures, targeting April 13th. We made two changes from our original release plan: earlier release dates and include the change in NuGet functionality for Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\n## Who is affected\r\n\r\n.NET 5+ users will be affected on any operating system that has removed the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority`. We are maintaining a list of [Linux distros that are known to be affected](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56).\r\n\r\n`nuget.exe` is sometimes used on Linux with Mono. This scenario is not affected.\r\n\r\nThere has been an [industry-wide movement to distrust the VeriSign root CA](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/03/12/distrust-symantec-tls-certificates/), including companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla. This may mean that at anytime in the future, [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212140) and [Microsoft](https://ccadb-public.secure.force.com/microsoft/IncludedCACertificateReportForMSFT) can remove `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority` from their trusted root CA list.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe NuGet team has [disabled the package verification feature](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/3979) for macOS and Linux. If needed, we will disable the feature for Windows at a later time. This change will be available in the updated .NET builds covered earlier.\r\n\r\nWe are also [talking to some Linux distro package maintainers](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/ca-certificates/-/issues/1) to ask them to delay the removal of the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority` (for code signing only). Even a month of grace would help a lot, to enable .NET users on Linux to adopt the newer .NET 5 and .NET 6 builds.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, this change does not affect .NET Core 3.1 and earlier versions. It does not affect .NET Framework. It does not affect any .NET functionality on Windows, at least not at this time.\r\n\r\n## More Context\r\n\r\nWe observed [NuGet Restore Issues on Debian Family Linux Distros](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/49) in January, 2021. This led us to discover that there has been an industry-wide movement to remove the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority`.\r\n\r\nNuGet has historically relied on two key certificates:\r\n\r\n- NuGet Microsoft Author Signing Certificate Update - Expired January 27th, 2021\r\n- NuGet.org Repository Signing Certificate Update - Expires April 14th, 2021\r\n\r\nAfter those certificates expire, the NuGet client falls back to [timestamp verification](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/reference/signed-packages-reference), which enables package verification to still function. The timestamp verification relies on VeriSign root certificate authority. The absence of this root certificate authority being available on a machine means that timestamp verification is no longer functional, which causes package signature verification to fail.\r\n\r\nSecurity is very important to us. We are putting together a plan to use a new system that will allow us to re-enable package signing verification on all supported operating systems. We will have more to share on our future plans once we are sure that all systems are once again functional.\r\n\r\n[.NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56) provides more details on error messages, affected environments, and solutions.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/180","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"NuGet package restore broken on .NET 5+ with Removal of Trust of VeriSign CA\" (#180)"},{"Id":"837071846","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-30T21:15:03","Actor":"Nirmal4G","Number":"179","RawContent":null,"Title":"Preserve git refspec to local patches and branches after renamed origin's master","State":"closed","Body":"For all those who can't pull `master`, it should have renamed to `main`.\r\n\r\nTo preserve refspec to patches and branches, just changing the `heads/master` to `heads/main` should work.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n[remote \"origin\"]\r\n\turl = https://github.com/dotnet/your-repo\r\n-\tfetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n+\tfetch = +refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n\ttagopt = --no-tags\r\n[branch \"master\"]\r\n\tremote = origin\r\n-\tmerge = refs/heads/master\r\n+\tmerge = refs/heads/main\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Putting this out there, if anyone else facing similar issue with git.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/179","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Preserve git refspec to local patches and branches after renamed origin's master\" (#179)"},{"Id":"826383777","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-09T18:01:29","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"178","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-26701 | .NET Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-26701 | .NET Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 5.0, .NET Core 3.1, and .NET Core 2.1.

This announcement describes the process and what you need to do on your end.\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a smaller list of repos and grow from there. Theses are the planned starting repos:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/project-system](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system) ✔ \r\n* [dotnet/llvm-project](https://github.com/dotnet/llvm-project) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/icu](https://github.com/dotnet/icu) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/xharness](https://github.com/dotnet/xharness) ✔\r\n* [mono/linker](https://github.com/mono/linker) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/docker-tools](https://github.com/dotnet/docker-tools) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/wcf](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/iot](https://github.com/dotnet/iot) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms) ✔\r\n\r\nWe're starting with a smaller list to ensure we catch all cases where we need to update corresponding configuration in our Arcade-based tooling (see [this fantastic blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/) on how we build .NET).\r\n\r\nOnce we have validated our checklist, each repo admin will rename the default branch at their own pace. We expect to complete all repos in the next couple of months.\r\n\r\n## What you can expect\r\n\r\n*We have a detailed guide you can find at <https://aka.ms/m2m-dotnet>. This is only the essentials.*\r\n\r\nWe'll add a sticky issue to each repo when we're about to rename the branch. We'll do this a few days before and we'll leave it there for two weeks.\r\n\r\n**You don't need to update your PRs**. If you submitted a PR against the old default branch, the GitHub tooling will automatically retarget your PR against the new default branch (main).\r\n\r\nFor sanity, **you should rename the default branch in your fork as well**.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.

This transfer will also leverage Canonical expertise with Snap packaging and enhance the design of .NET Snaps for added improvements. Canonical is currently working on creating new .NET Snap packages.\r\n\r\nYou will continue to leverage Snaps to install/update .NET for all the supported .NET versions (currently include .NET 6, .NET 7, and .NET 8). Like the current state, you can use Snap to install .NET SDK or .NET Core Runtime.\r\n\r\n### Important Dates, Impact, and Call to Action\r\n\r\n1. The ownership transfer of the existing .NET Snaps from Microsoft to Canonical.\r\n\r\n   Date: May 2024 (_Stay tuned for exact date_)\r\n   Impact: No impact on .NET Snap user \r\n   Call to action: No action needed.\r\n\r\n2. Transition from the old Snap packages to the newly built Snaps by Canonical.\r\n\r\n    Impact:\r\n- New Snap will package Canonical-built .NET. As Canonical does not build/publish .2xx and higher SDK feature bands due to breaking changes, new Snap will only support .1xx SDK feature band for the lifetime of a major .NET version.\r\n- .NET previews (.NET 9 previews) will not be available to install via Snap.\r\n\r\n   _Stay tuned for date and call to action to switch from old to new .NET Snaps._\r\n\r\n### Issue Log\r\nAfter ownership is transferred from Microsoft to Canonical in May, log any .NET Snap issues to the dotnet-snap repository under the Canonical org [https://github.com/canonical/dotnet-snap](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcanonical%2Fdotnet-snap&data=05%7C02%7Cashitanagar%40microsoft.com%7Cc5b9b895923f4c11483908dc57efcb4c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638481934634983274%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=fvusMJ%2Fl94m3WaJvpM7kK85%2BzIXGLsenPt7BmKPtRSU%3D&reserved=0).\r\n\r\n### Important Links\r\n[.NET SDK Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/dotnet-sdk)\r\n[Canonical GitHub Repository](https://github.com/canonical/dotnet-snap)\r\n"},{"Id":"37311676843","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-04-09T18:22:02","Actor":"rbhanda","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/303","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-21409 | .NET Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\" (#303) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-21409 | .NET Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 ,and .NET 8.0.

These events go through the system in slightly different fashions, requestcounter goes through standard telemetry calls on disposal whereas requestduration goes through the aggregated telemetry logging.\r\n\r\nBoth of these are intended to aggregate multiple calls into a single message, but the cadence at which they send telemetry differs. They both flush on project/VS close, but the requestduration method also flushes every 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nI've noticed that VS shutdown is now more abrupt than previously, often not giving our disposers a chance to send out telemetry. This is why I believe there is such a large discepency in the telemetry numbers for these methods, when they should be the same. This PR allows for the requestcounter messages to also be sent out every 30 minutes in case the disposal codepath isn't executed.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/assets/6785178/14e28c32-0d23-46a8-b1a1-341e8818dfb8)\r\n"},{"Id":"37976756234","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-05-01T00:06:41","Actor":"RikkiGibson","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/72999","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Partial properties: merging declarations and emit of simple cases\" (#72999) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"Test plan: #73090\r\n"},{"Id":"37976694565","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-05-01T00:03:03","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73286","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Merge release/dev17.10 to release/dev17.11\" (#73286) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"\nThis is an automatically generated pull request from release/dev17.10 into release/dev17.11.\n\n\nOnce all conflicts are resolved and all the tests pass, you are free to merge the pull request. 🐯\n\n## Troubleshooting conflicts\n\n### Identify authors of changes which introduced merge conflicts\nScroll to the bottom, then for each file containing conflicts copy its path into the following searches:\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/release/dev17.10\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/release/dev17.11\n\nUsually the most recent change to a file between the two branches is considered to have introduced the conflicts, but sometimes it will be necessary to look for the conflicting lines and check the blame in each branch.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

These events go through the system in slightly different fashions, requestcounter goes through standard telemetry calls on disposal whereas requestduration goes through the aggregated telemetry logging.\r\n\r\nBoth of these are intended to aggregate multiple calls into a single message, but the cadence at which they send telemetry differs. They both flush on project/VS close, but the requestduration method also flushes every 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nI've noticed that VS shutdown is now more abrupt than previously, often not giving our disposers a chance to send out telemetry. This is why I believe there is such a large discepency in the telemetry numbers for these methods, when they should be the same. This PR allows for the requestcounter messages to also be sent out every 30 minutes in case the disposal codepath isn't executed.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/assets/6785178/14e28c32-0d23-46a8-b1a1-341e8818dfb8)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73287","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Move AsyncBatchingWorkQueue usage in telemetry to TelemetryLogging level\" (#73287)"},{"Id":"2272551456","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-30T23:37:00","Actor":"tmat","Number":"73285","RawContent":null,"Title":"Load projects referenced through ProjectReference with ReferenceOutputAssembly=false to MSBuildWorkspace","State":"closed","Body":"These projects are currently not included in the solution, which breaks dotnet-watch.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73285","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Load projects referenced through ProjectReference with ReferenceOutputAssembly=false to MSBuildWorkspace\" (#73285)"},{"Id":"2272304213","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-30T23:12:19","Actor":"ToddGrun","Number":"73282","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix failures in C# LSP inline completion (snippets)","State":"closed","Body":"These failures were happening due to serialization failing on the types being passed over the wire due to missing DataContract attributes.

It would be better if the latter error has been reported in C# 12 as well. This happens because unsafe/safe contexts changed slightly between C# 12 and 13, so in C# 12 the compiler thinks we are in unsafe context and you just need to upgrade to C# 13, but in C# 13 we are suddenly in safe context, so you get the unsafe error. For example:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nunsafe class C\r\n{\r\n    System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<int> M()\r\n    {\r\n        int* p = null; // langversion error in C# 12; unsafe error in C# 13\r\n        yield break;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly, there can be errors in C# 12 saying a construct (e.g., await or pointer) is not supported in an unsafe context. But if you upgrade to C# 13, that feature works since the context becomes safe. It would be better if we reported a langversion error in C# 12 (i.e., error saying \"feature is not supported in C# 12\", so users know they can just upgrade to make the error scenario work). For example:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nunsafe class C\r\n{\r\n    System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<int> M()\r\n    {\r\n        var lam = () => sizeof(nint); // unsafe error in C# 12; works in C# 13\r\n        yield break;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLastly, there are some unnecessary diagnostics in C# 12 where you get an error for every unsafe construct in an unsafe block inside an iterator even though you already got that error for the unsafe block itself, so the nested errors are just noise. Note that this is a preexisting behavior, only previously the errors said \"cannot use unsafe in iterators\" and now they say \"unsafe in iterators is not supported in C# 12\". They disappear completely in C# 13. Still, we could filter them out in C# 12, but that is tricky because we do not know if we are inside an unsafe block in an iterator (see `M1` below) or if the unsafe context is just inherited from parent (in which case we cannot filter out the errors; see `M2` below). For example:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nunsafe class C\r\n{\r\n    System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<int> M1()\r\n    {\r\n        unsafe // langversion error in C# 12\r\n        {\r\n            int* p; // unnecessary langversion error in C# 12\r\n        }\r\n        yield break;\r\n    }\r\n    System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<int> M2()\r\n    {\r\n        int* p; // necessary langversion error in C# 12\r\n        yield break;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll of these could be solved by e.g., having separate BinderFlags for \"unsafe region in C# 12\" and \"unsafe region in C# 13\" that we could use in the compiler to decide which diagnostics to report. However, BinderFlags is `uint` currently and does not have any free slots.\r\n\r\nNote: this issue will be referenced in tests (via https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73046).\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/72662.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/73280","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Consider improving langversion diagnostics for \"unsafe in iterators\" feature\" (#73280)"},{"Id":"2270675168","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-30T07:09:08","Actor":"mihaimyh","Number":"73279","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build fails on .NET 7","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n\r\nTrying to build a .net 7 web application in Visual Studio version 17.10.0 Preview 5.0 but I am getting the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1>Skipping analyzers to speed up the build.

I use the \"Move Type To...\" tool quite frequently and it was working perfectly yesterday morning. After a short break and reboot, I noticed that VSCode had updated to V1.81.0 and a short time later that when ever I wrote a class definition within an existing .cs file and tried to move the class to its own file using the \"Move Type To...\" feature, by highlighting the class definition and ctrl . \"Move Type To <filename>\", that the highlighted class definition would be removed but a new .cs file would not be created.  I tried to: close VS Code, close Unity project, reopen unity project and reopen a C# script. I tried to \"Regenerate project files\" within the Unity preferences window. I tried to downgrade then upgrade the Visual Studio Code package in the Unity Package Manager, I checked VSCode extensions for any updates and updated any that needed. I installed the new Unity Extension. Downgrading C# Dev Kit to V0.2.100. And still the same behaviour.  I loaded some other Unity projects and note that they I am not even presented with the \"Move Type To..\" option when trying to do the same task.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nOpened my Unity 2020.3 project, and double clicked on a cs file to open in VSCode.  Wrote a new class definition within the namespace block in the currently opened file, highlighted and pressed ctrl . for context menu, using arrow keys navigated to the \"Move Type To <classname>.cs\" and pressed enter. The highlighted class definition disappears as it normally would as though it had been moved to the new file but a new cs file is not generated and new tab created with moved class definition is not displayed.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nGenerally when using the feature, the selected code is removed from the current cs file and placed into a newly generated cs file and a new tab is opened with the moved code.\n\n### Environment Information\n\n- OS: Windows 11 Build 22H2\r\n- VSCode V 1.81.0\r\n- Unity 2020.3.47f1\r\n- Extensions:\r\n      C# Dev Kit V0.3.21\r\n      Unity V0.9.0","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/73273","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[BUG]  \"Move Type To ..\" feature not generating new .cs file\" (#73273)"},{"Id":"2270153879","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-29T23:20:51","Actor":"arkalyanms","Number":"73272","RawContent":null,"Title":"Error when applying IDE0079 in problems tab","State":"open","Body":"From vscode-dotnettools created by [solrevdev](https://github.com/solrevdev): microsoft/vscode-dotnettools#214  \n\n\nType: <b>Bug</b>\n\nIn the problems tab I click on the lightbulb next to the first \"Remove unnecessary supression (IDE0079) line then choose the single refactoring line then I get an error and the expected refactoring does not happen.\n\n\n\nExtension version: 0.1.103\nVS Code version: Code - Insiders 1.80.0-insider (7406a9bdfca18f82a3977ba5eac908d41df7ccac, 2023-06-30T05:37:52.506Z)\nOS version: Darwin arm64 22.5.0\nModes:\n\n<details>\n<summary>System Info</summary>\n\n|Item|Value|\n|---|---|\n|CPUs|Apple M1 (8 x 24)|\n|GPU Status|2d_canvas: enabled<br>canvas_oop_rasterization: disabled_off<br>direct_rendering_display_compositor: disabled_off_ok<br>gpu_compositing: enabled<br>metal: disabled_off<br>multiple_raster_threads: enabled_on<br>opengl: enabled_on<br>rasterization: enabled<br>raw_draw: disabled_off_ok<br>video_decode: enabled<br>video_encode: enabled<br>vulkan: disabled_off<br>webgl: enabled<br>webgl2: enabled<br>webgpu: enabled|\n|Load (avg)|3, 2, 2|\n|Memory (System)|16.00GB (0.05GB free)|\n|Process Argv|--crash-reporter-id 4833a52a-ed11-4d5d-b549-6ace2400b2b2|\n|Screen Reader|no|\n|VM|0%|\n</details><details>\n<summary>A/B Experiments</summary>\n\n```\nvsliv695:30137379\nvsins829:30139715\nvsliv368:30146709\nvsreu685:30147344\npython383:30185418\nvspor879:30202332\nvspor708:30202333\nvspor363:30204092\nvslsvsres303:30308271\npythontb:30258533\nvsc_aa:30263845\npythonptprofiler:30281269\nvshan820:30294714\nvscod805cf:30301675\nbridge0708:30335490\nbridge0723:30353136\nvsaa593:30376534\npythonvs932:30404738\npy29gd2263:30776702\nvsclangdf:30492506\nc4g48928:30535728\ndsvsc012:30540252\npynewext54:30618038\npylantcb52:30590116\npyind779:30611226\npythonsymbol12:30651887\na9j8j154:30646983\nshowlangstatbar:30737417\npythonms35:30671666\n03d35959:30757351\n7ij38806:30687742\npythonfmttext:30716741\npythoncmvfstr:30726892\nfixshowwlkth:30771523\nshowindicator:30766888\npythongtdpath:30726887\ni26e3531:30769768\ngsofa:30778558\npythonnosmt12:30779711\npythonidxpt:30768918\npythondjangots:30768917\npythonnoceb:30776497\ncopilotsettingc:30767685\ne537b577:30772214\nh0f32768:30779712\ndsvsc013:30777762\ndsvsc014:30777825\n\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- generated by issue reporter -->","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/73272","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Error when applying IDE0079 in problems tab\" (#73272)"},{"Id":"2269441255","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-29T22:58:12","Actor":"AmadeusW","Number":"73260","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix need for redundant enter when rename suggestions are not available [17.10]","State":"closed","Body":"Ports #73247  to `release/dev17.10`\r\n\r\n# Context\r\nIn the current AI rename experience, developer needs to hit Enter twice to complete the rename. \r\n\r\nRename is completed only when user pressed enter and there is no popup with suggestions.

This transfer will also leverage Canonical expertise with Snap packaging and enhance the design of .NET Snaps for added improvements. Canonical is currently working on creating new .NET Snap packages.\r\n\r\nYou will continue to leverage Snaps to install/update .NET for all the supported .NET versions (currently include .NET 6, .NET 7, and .NET 8). Like the current state, you can use Snap to install .NET SDK and .NET Runtime.\r\n\r\n### Important Dates, Impact, and Call to Action\r\n\r\n1. The ownership transfer of the existing .NET Snaps from Microsoft to Canonical.\r\n\r\n   Date: May 2024 (_Stay tuned for exact date_)\r\n   Impact: No impact on .NET Snap user \r\n   Call to action: No action needed.\r\n\r\n2. Transition from the old Snap packages to the newly built Snaps by Canonical.\r\n\r\n    Impact:\r\n- New Snap will package Canonical-built .NET.

It’s long been known by security practitioners that any deserializer, binary or text, which allows its input to carry information about the objects to be created is a security problem waiting to happen. There is even a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) that describes the issue, [CWE-502 “Deserialization of Untrusted Data”](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html) and examples of this type of vulnerability run from security issues in Exchange through security issues in Apache. Within Microsoft the use of ``BinaryFormatter`` with untrusted input has caused many instances of heartache, late nights, and weekend work trying to produce a solution.\r\n\r\nIn .NET Core 1.0 we removed ``BinaryFormatter`` entirely due to its known risks, but without a clear path to using something safer customer demand brought it back to .NET Core 1.1. Since then, we have been on the path to removal, slowly turning it off by default in multiple project types but letting you opt-in via flags if you still needed it for backward compatibility. .NET 9 sees the culmination of this effort with the removal of ``BinaryFormatter``. In .NET 9 these flags will no longer exist and the in-box implementation of ``BinaryFormatter`` will throw exceptions in any project type when you try to use it. However, if you are committed to using a class that cannot be made secure you will still be able to.\r\n\r\n## It's not that it’s binary\r\n\r\nWe pick on ``BinaryFormatter`` because of its ubiquitous use, but the problem is not that the payload is binary, the problem is that the payload tells .NET what objects to create. That capability is what makes ``BinaryFormatter`` so popular, you can throw pretty much any class at it, and it will serialize and deserialize it correctly without developers having to do any work. However, it is also what makes it so dangerous.\r\n\r\nThere are classes within .NET which, by design, can run arbitrary code, and if you try to deserialize those through any deserialization code that creates objects based on the payload you end up with “Remote Code Execution” (RCE), a class of security vulnerability that allows the attacker to run their own code within your application, under the privileges your application has.\r\n\r\nThis has been a known problem as far back as 2012, when the Black Hat security conference featured the canonical presentation on .NET’s version of the problem, [Are you my type? Breaking .NET through Serialization, James Forshaw](https://paper.bobylive.com/Meeting_Papers/BlackHat/USA-2012/BH_US_12_Forshaw_Are_You_My_Type_WP.pdf). There’s even a GitHub repository dedicated to hunting and showing these types of attacks in .NET, [https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net](https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net).\r\n\r\nImagine your code has a class DeleteAllMyData. If you accept a payload from untrusted input, for example a web page, an attacker can create a payload that contains an instance of DeleteAllMyData and when you deserialize that payload you will get a chance to discover if your database backups actually restore.\r\n\r\nOther .NET serialization formats (and serialization formats in other languages and frameworks) allow for class information to be passed in a payload, to pick on our own framework ``SoapFormatter``, ``LosFormatter``, ``NetDataContractSerializer`` and ``ObjectStateFormatter`` all exhibit the same dangerous characteristics.\r\n\r\nEven JSON.NET has an opt-in option to allow the creation of a payload that specifies class names, and that is a text format, not a binary one. Other JSON deserializers (both .NET and Java) suffered from the same problem, as demonstrated at Black Hat 2017, [Friday the 13th JSON Attacks, Alvaro Muñoz & Oleksandr Mirosh](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Munoz-Friday-The-13th-JSON-Attacks-wp.pdf).\r\n\r\nYour takeaway should be that there’s nothing inherently wrong with a binary payload, it’s the fact that the ``BinaryFormatter`` payload contains instructions on the classes to be created, and what should go into that class’s properties that make it so dangerous. Other serializers, including some JSON serializers, also have the same ability, making them equally dangerous to use.\r\n\r\n## Real Word Examples of BinaryFormatter security bugs\r\n\r\nWithin Microsoft, ``BinaryFormatter`` has been the cause of a quite a few security problems, including:\r\n\r\n* In Exchange, [CVE-2021-42321](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166153/Microsoft-Exchange-Server-Remote-Code-Execution.html), where a binder had a spelling mistake that led to RCE.\r\n* In Azure DevOps, [CVE-2019-1306](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2019/10/23/cve-2019-1306-are-you-my-index), where invalid MarkDown used ``BinaryFormatter`` and granted RCE.\r\n* In SharePoint, [CVE-2022-22005](https://blog.viettelcybersecurity.com/cve-2022-22005-microsoft-sharepoint-rce-2/), where loading images for charts used ``BinaryFormatter`` and once again lead to RCE.\r\n\r\nThere has been an outright ban on using ``BinaryFormatter`` for new projects at Microsoft for years, and an ongoing effort to remove it from older code for almost as long as the usage ban in new code. We have added code analyzers, warnings, and public documentation, and yet still we see people using it and ending up with RCE bugs. It feels like we need to do more.\r\n\r\n## BinaryFormatter is not fixable\r\n\r\n``BinaryFormatter`` has other problems around algorithmic complexity, unbounded cache growth, and unintended object graph edge manipulation. If we take out one insecure piece, replace it with a secure piece, and keep going until all the insecure pieces are replaced there is not much of the original ``BinaryFormatter`` left. A secure version would have a vastly different API shape and it could not be a drop-in replacement. It would require massive refactoring of application code to use, so, really, would it even be ``BinaryFormatter`` anymore?\r\n\r\nSerialization binders, a type of class used to inspect types during deserialization, are often proposed as a control mechanism to stop ``BinaryFormatter`` doing bad things, but there are code paths in ``BinaryFormatter`` that bypass binders by design, and writing a correct binder that isn’t vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack is extremely hard.\r\n\r\n## The plan for .NET 9\r\n\r\nFor the last few .NET releases newly introduced project types such as Blazor or MAUI projects have been unable to use ``BinaryFormatter`` at all. ASP.NET projects are particularly vulnerable as their entire purpose is to take untrusted input and were also part of the ban. For some, older, project types you have been able to opt into using ``BinaryFormatter`` by setting a flag.\r\n\r\nOur current intentions are:\r\n\r\n1. The in-box implementation of ``BinaryFormatter`` will throw exceptions when you try to use it, even if you set any of the settings that previously enabled its use. We are also removing these settings.\r\n2. A new NuGet package will be provided, (with a suitable name like Microsoft.Unsupported.BinaryFormatter) which you could add to your projects. With a small config change in your app, ``BinaryFormatter`` will appear again, which is useful if you judge the risk of ``BinaryFormatter`` acceptable for your use cases. This NuGet package will be permanently marked as vulnerable so that dependency and code scanners can detect ``BinaryFormatter`` usage easily.\r\n3. We will also provide a safe reader in its own NuGet package. This reader will allow you to read a ``BinaryFormatter`` payload and it will return an object graph describing the payload. Each node in the graph will represent an object in the payload and each edge represents a reference between objects.\r\n\r\nThe safe reader will allow you to evaluate the classes within a ``BinaryFormatter`` payload, providing a representation of the object graph with each node containing information on the object type, and a list of its fields and their values. The node structure we are considering looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class Node\r\n{\r\n    public SomeTypeDescriptor ObjectType;\r\n    public Dictionary<string, object> Fields;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will use a new class for the object type descriptor (whose name is yet to be decided) to impede naïve developers calling ``Type.GetType(theNodeType)`` and reintroducing the same fundamentally insecure behavior that we are trying to stop.\r\n\r\nSay you had had a class ``Customer`` and a class ``Address``, and your customer had a ``ShippingAddress`` and ``BillingAddress``, both of which are properties in the customer class, with a type of ``Address``. The fields within the ``Customer`` object node would be something like ``{ \"ShippingAddress\", node_for_ship_addr }`` and ``{ \"BillingAddress\", node_for_bill_addr }``.\r\n\r\nThis graph will allow you to both validate the types in the payload against types you are expecting and provide data you can use to rehydrate your objects.\r\n\r\n## Preparing for migration\r\n\r\nTo migrate away from ``BinaryFormatter`` is going to take work. There is no drop-in replacement, nor is there a single path that fits everyone because everyone’s classes are different and there are too many varied use cases.\r\n\r\nThe first step to migrating away from ``BinaryFormatter`` should be selecting a new serialization format. Remember that binary representation is safe if the produced payload does not instruct the deserialization process to create types. The same restriction applies to text-based formats.\r\n\r\nAt Microsoft, a lot of teams have moved from ``BinaryFormatter`` to ``[ProtoBuf](https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/csharptutorial/)`` (you will even see some familiar names in the commit history for the C# version). Other teams, whose data is text and where textual representation have advantages like easy searching have moved to JSON.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of choices out there, but we cannot pick a winner for you. Each potential serializer has pluses and minuses, and how you weigh these is a decision only you can make for your application. Factors can include speed, memory consumption, storage costs, whether it is human readable, whether it is standards based and so on.\r\n\r\nThe ideal safe use of the proposed SafeReader class is to perform conversions of existing data into your chosen new serialization format and run this conversion in as much isolation as possible, for example a virtual machine or a container, again analyzing the types in each payload, rehydrating objects, and then reserializing them in your chosen serialization format.\r\n\r\nIf your class properties are primitive types, for example int, bool, or strings then the proposed safe reader could work as part of a replacement deserialization mechanism at runtime, leaving you to do the object rehydration once you have validated the types are those you expect.\r\n\r\nOr, if you accept the risk of Remote Code Execution, or, if you are sure that no-one can tamper with your messages or data (such a promise is extremely hard to make for online systems or for desktop or mobile apps) then you might consider using the proposed NuGet package. If you choose to take this route, please remember that this package is unsupported. We will not fix security issues in ``BinaryFormatter``.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nIf you are using ``BinaryFormatter`` now you should start looking at alternative serialization formats and decide what works for you in your specific circumstance, be it saved object graphs, network transports, temporary round tripped data, or any other type of data.\r\nYou should look at all your saved data and plan to convert any data serialized by ``BinaryFormatter`` into the new serialization format you have chosen.\r\n\r\nYou should evaluate how much backwards compatibility you need, and how long you need it for.\r\n\r\nFinally, you need to get off ``BinaryFormatter``, it is too dangerous to use any more and that is why it is leaving the .NET runtime.\r\n\r\n[Discussion Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/98245)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/293","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"BinaryFormatter is being removed in .NET 9\" (#293)"},{"Id":"2072888869","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T18:00:52","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"292","RawContent":null,"Title":" Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-0056: Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient SQL Data provider Information Disclosure Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-0056: Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient SQL Data provider Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET's System.Data.SqlClient and Microsoft.Data.SqlClient NuGet Packages.

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nA security feature bypass vulnerability exists when Microsoft .NET Framework-based applications use X.509 chain building APIs but do not completely validate the X.509 certificate due to a logic flaw. An attacker could present an arbitrary untrusted certificate with malformed signatures, triggering a bug in the framework. The framework will correctly report that X.509 chain building failed, but it will return an incorrect reason code for the failure. Applications which utilize this reason code to make their own chain building trust decisions may inadvertently treat this scenario as a successful chain build. This could allow an adversary to subvert the app's typical authentication logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at  https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/96700\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nWithin .NET, only the WindowsDesktop shared runtime contains inbox components which utilize X.509 chain building APIs in a vulnerable manner.

The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.

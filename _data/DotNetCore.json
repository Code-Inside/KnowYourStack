This transfer will also leverage Canonical expertise with Snap packaging and enhance the design of .NET Snaps for added improvements. Canonical is currently working on creating new .NET Snap packages.\r\n\r\nYou will continue to leverage Snaps to install/update .NET for all the supported .NET versions (currently include .NET 6, .NET 7, and .NET 8). Like the current state, you can use Snap to install .NET SDK or .NET Core Runtime.\r\n\r\n### Important Dates, Impact, and Call to Action\r\n\r\n1. The ownership transfer of the existing .NET Snaps from Microsoft to Canonical.\r\n\r\n   Date: May 2024 (_Stay tuned for exact date_)\r\n   Impact: No impact on .NET Snap user \r\n   Call to action: No action needed.\r\n\r\n2. Transition from the old Snap packages to the newly built Snaps by Canonical.\r\n\r\n    Impact:\r\n- New Snap will package Canonical-built .NET. As Canonical does not build/publish .2xx and higher SDK feature bands due to breaking changes, new Snap will only support .1xx SDK feature band for the lifetime of a major .NET version.\r\n- .NET previews (.NET 9 previews) will not be available to install via Snap.\r\n\r\n   _Stay tuned for date and call to action to switch from old to new .NET Snaps._\r\n\r\n### Issue Log\r\nAfter ownership is transferred from Microsoft to Canonical in May, log any .NET Snap issues to the dotnet-snap repository under the Canonical org [https://github.com/canonical/dotnet-snap](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcanonical%2Fdotnet-snap&data=05%7C02%7Cashitanagar%40microsoft.com%7Cc5b9b895923f4c11483908dc57efcb4c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638481934634983274%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=fvusMJ%2Fl94m3WaJvpM7kK85%2BzIXGLsenPt7BmKPtRSU%3D&reserved=0).\r\n\r\n### Important Links\r\n[.NET SDK Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/dotnet-sdk)\r\n[Canonical GitHub Repository](https://github.com/canonical/dotnet-snap)\r\n"},{"Id":"37311676843","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-04-09T18:22:02","Actor":"rbhanda","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/303","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-21409 | .NET Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\" (#303) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-21409 | .NET Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 ,and .NET 8.0.

issue \"Expose `SeparatedSyntaxList<T>.GetWithSeparators()` through interface\" (#73575) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"## Background and Motivation\r\n\r\n`SeparatedSyntaxList<T>` is a generic type, so when a value of this type is retrieved via reflection, we don't have a useful non-generic type to refer to. `GetWithSeparators()` returns `SyntaxNodeOrTokenList` which is unbound to the generic type, thus requiring unnecessary workarounds, like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// given:\r\nIReadOnlyList<SyntaxNode> list;\r\nvar listType = list.GetType();\r\n\r\nvar genericDefinition = listType.GetGenericTypeDefinition();\r\nif (genericDefinition == typeof(SeparatedSyntaxList<>))\r\n{\r\n    // we use the underlying node or token list to display children\r\n    SyntaxNodeOrTokenList nodeOrTokenList = (list as dynamic).GetWithSeparators();\r\n    return Use(nodeOrTokenList);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Proposed API\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n namespace Microsoft.CodeAnalysis\r\n {\r\n+    public interface ISeparatedSyntaxList\r\n+    {\r\n+        public SyntaxNodeOrTokenList GetWithSeparators();\r\n+    }\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage Examples\r\n\r\nThe above evaluator can be rewritten as (assuming we only care about `SeparatedSyntaxList<T>`):\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// given:\r\nISeparatedSyntaxList list;\r\nSyntaxNodeOrTokenList nodeOrTokenList = list.GetWithSeparators();\r\nreturn Use(nodeOrTokenList);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Alternative Designs\r\n\r\nRetaining the design as-is.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nBloating the API with further interface

The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key.

retrieved via reflection, we don't have a useful non-generic type to refer to. `GetWithSeparators()` returns `SyntaxNodeOrTokenList` which is unbound to the generic type, thus requiring unnecessary workarounds, like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// given:\r\nIReadOnlyList<SyntaxNode> list;\r\nvar listType = list.GetType();\r\n\r\nvar genericDefinition = listType.GetGenericTypeDefinition();\r\nif

None of the Razor services are actually instantiated, but the language server's MEF registration causes the _assembly_ containing the Razor services to load. This is because the MEF metadata view for each LSP service includes the service's `System.Type`, which requires the service's assembly to be loaded. The language server uses that type for reflection, probing implemented interfaces and collecting information about request handler methods.\r\n\r\nThis pull request makes significant changes to CLaSP and the Roslyn language server's service registration. Instead of capturing the `System.Type`, the necessary reflection is performed up front in the export attributes and the reflected information is loaded into the MEF metadata view. UIn addition, a helper `TypeRef` class has been added to CLaSP to replace anywhere in the API that the `Type` is exposed. `TypeRef` avoids loading the actual `System.Type` until it's requested.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I've made several other improvements to CLaSP and LSP services:\r\n\r\n- Removed `ILspServices.SupportsGetRegisteredServices()` and `ILspServices.GetRegisteredServices()`. This functionality is now available in CLaSP as `IMethodHandlerProvider`, which any `ILspServices` can optionally implement. (Fixes #63555)\r\n- Replaced `ImmutableDictionaries` with `FrozenDictionaries` in `LspServices`, since the dictionaries are computed once for the lifetime of the language server.\r\n- Fixed an issue I noticed where lazily computed base services would return new instances each time they were requested. It turned out that this didn't happen in practice (except for `TelemetryService`), but I decided to fix this now rather than get bitten by it later.\r\n- Made `ILspServices.TryGetService(...)` follow the .NET TryGet* pattern.\r\n\r\ncc @dibarbet and @davidwengier","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73566","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Don't implicitly load assemblies via MEF in Roslyn language server\" (#73566)"},{"Id":"2303356815","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-17T22:14:56","Actor":"AlekseyTs","Number":"73561","RawContent":null,"Title":"Deal with some PROTOTYPE comments","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73561","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Deal with some PROTOTYPE comments\" (#73561)"},{"Id":"2303631699","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-17T22:05:54","Actor":"sharwell","Number":"73564","RawContent":null,"Title":"Work around crash in Document Outline","State":"open","Body":"The fix for dotnet/wpf#122 was never backported to .NET Framework, so we work around the issue in our own code to avoid random crashes while Document Outline is visible.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73564","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Work around crash in Document Outline\" (#73564)"},{"Id":"2303413317","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-17T20:54:15","Actor":"AlekseyTs","Number":"73562","RawContent":null,"Title":"Pack values for enum members","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/73562","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Pack values for enum members\" (#73562)"},{"Id":"2303491733","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-17T19:59:19","Actor":"AlekseyTs","Number":"73563","RawContent":null,"Title":"Assert fires in `EnsureMetadataVirtual` ","State":"open","Body":"Assert fires in `EnsureMetadataVirtual` when the tests below are executed with `CompilationExtensions.EnableVerifyUsedAssemblies` set to true. \r\n```\r\n            public void EnsureMetadataVirtual()\r\n            {\r\n                // ACASEY: This assert is here to check that we're not mutating the value of IsMetadataVirtual after\r\n                // someone has consumed it.

the bug\r\nI want to ping about 180 IPs that most of them, say about 175 of them are disconnected from local network and respond timeout. I know about this and I set timeout in `Ping` Command to 10ms so It shouldn't take a lot of time! BUT It takes 110 seconds to complete that is about 600ms. I tested `async/await` and without that, I used `foreach` and `await Task.WhenAll` but non of them seem to work, It is really weird. when I have them connected, I can say that this process takes about 1 sec to complete! I assume that this `timeout` setting in `Ping` command is just Ridiculous and doesn't do a thing. If this works, assume that all the IPs are dead, It should take 1.8 seconds to complete.\r\n\r\none of my codes:\r\n\r\n            string data = \"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\";\r\n            byte[] byteBuffer = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(data);\r\n            var list = new List<Task<PingReply>>();\r\n            foreach (var item in model)\r\n            {\r\n                list.Add(new Ping().SendPingAsync(item.DevIPWIFI,10,byteBuffer));  // no await here\r\n            }\r\n            var replies = await Task.WhenAll(list);`\r\n\r\nthe other one:\r\n\r\n            foreach (var item in model)\r\n            {\r\n                PingReply reply = new Ping().Send(item.DevIPWIFI,10);\r\n            }`\r\n\r\nand tested this one either:\r\n`PingReply reply = await new Ping().SendPingAsync(item.DevIPWIFI,10); // And this one with await`\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\nmake a list of 180 IPs that are disconnected and respond with timeout. Use `SendPingAsync()` or `Send()` Method to get respond.\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\nNONE\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n- Dotnet 8.0.5\r\n- VS 17.9.7\r\n- Windows 10","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/40989","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Slow Ping\" (#40989)"},{"Id":"2304112515","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-18T14:24:57","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"40998","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from nuget/nuget.client","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:fcb199f6-ff33-44a0-f3ef-08d8e97c775d)\r\n## From https://github.com/nuget/nuget.client\r\n- **Subscription**: fcb199f6-ff33-44a0-f3ef-08d8e97c775d\r\n- **Build**: 6.11.0.55\r\n- **Date Produced**: May 17, 2024 10:05:28 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: f702fc3dc44e17a0666dea01e9aa18c5c1175b27\r\n- **Branch**: dev\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

I realized when looking into this that there are a lot of different jobs in the Installer repo versus this repo. So, it was necessary to consolidate and refactor the pipelines in this repo to handle all the new variations.\r\n\r\nI had some goals going into this:\r\n- Simply the existing pipeline definition(s)\r\n- Allow shared build logic between CI and PR pipelines\r\n- Add the job variations from the dotnet/installer repo (based on different os/platform/container configuration)\r\n- Remove unused information\r\n\r\n## Design\r\nDue to the recent changes required for the 1ES PT, this design took several iterations. I attempted to use [strategy matrix](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/customize-pipeline?view=azure-devops#build-across-multiple-platforms) at first, but this didn't work as much of the information passed to the 1ES PT needs to be compile-time parameters, such as pool and container information. Strategy matrix only provides run-time variables, so I hit a limitation with it when trying to do the Linux container builds.\r\n\r\nThe main design uses the [each expression](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/expressions?view=azure-devops#each-keyword) to scaffold the different jobs and information that pertains to those jobs, which I've called parameter sets. There is one parameter set array per platform (windows, linux, macOS) so that we can have a set of default parameter sets which pertain to the jobs that run tests (generally, PR builds). Since there are also internal PRs, these default parameter set arrays are also used in the CI yaml in that particular situation.\r\n\r\nThe hierarchy is as such:\r\n- The pipeline yaml (`.vsts-ci.yml` or `.vsts-pr.yml`) calls the `sdk-job-matrix.yml` template per platform (windows, linux, macOS).\r\n  - For official builds, the parameter sets are defined in the `.vsts-ci.yml`, while the default parameter sets (for testing) are defined in `sdk-job-matrix.yml`.\r\n- The `sdk-job-matrix.yml` template uses an each-expression to create separate instances of `sdk-build.yml` per parameter set array entry.\r\n  - The parameters from both the pipeline yaml and the parameter set are send and flattened as parameters to the `sdk-build.yml` template.\r\n- The `sdk-build.yml` template calls the appropriate `job.yml` template in Arcade depending on if the pipeline using 1ES PT or not.\r\n  - The `oneESCompat` parameter provides the strings necessary to switch the appropriate paths and tasks for the 1ES PT-based pipeline (`.vsts-ci.yml`).\r\n  - The steps contained in this template define both a build and test section. The test section is only ran if `runTests` is set to *true*, which it is by default, but set to *false* for regular CI builds.\r\n  - The steps have separate sections for *windows* versus *non-windows* since the Arcade scripts used are different.\r\n- Also created a `sdk-defaults.yml` which has some shared variables between the pipeline yamls (`.vsts-ci.yml` and `.vsts-pr.yml`).\r\n\r\n## Worthy Mentions\r\n- Added a \"Run A Test Build\" setting when manually queuing a CI build if you want to check the tests without creating a PR (for example, only pushed to an internal branch).\r\n- Made publishing the `build-configuration.json` a toggleable step as part of the main job, instead of needing a separate job that has to allocate an agent to publish 1 json file to the artifacts.\r\n- Made the OneLocBuild branch a simple parameter in the Windows section, which currently is: `locBranch: release/8.0.4xx`\r\n- Used `displayName` for the jobs so that the job names have an easy and human-readable structure to them.\r\n- Fixed the dotnet/format tests so they actually run properly (they were incorrectly specified in the `.vsts-ci.yml` pipeline instead of the `.vsts-pr.yml`)\r\n- All jobs run the build configuration as `Release`, which was decided upon for simplicity.\r\n\r\n## Test Runs\r\n- **CI**\r\n  - https://dnceng.visualstudio.com/internal/_build/results?buildId=2454301\r\n- **CI (in test build mode)**\r\n  - https://dnceng.visualstudio.com/internal/_build/results?buildId=2454302\r\n- **PR**\r\n  - https://dnceng-public.visualstudio.com/public/_build/results?buildId=679666","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/40983","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Refactor pipelines and add Installer jobs\" (#40983)"},{"Id":"2303184845","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-17T21:16:09","Actor":"omajid","Number":"40972","RawContent":null,"Title":"Do not leak a TextReader in BuildFPMToolPreReqs.cs","State":"closed","Body":"The method wasn't disposing the Reader when done.

FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\r\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n\r\n\r\n Version:   8.0.200\r\n Commit:    8473146e7d\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n\r\n  Version: 8.0.3\r\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n\r\n  8.0.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n\r\n  Microsoft.AspAspNetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspAspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.5  Runtime or .NET 8.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.8) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 7.0, you should download and install Runtime 7.0.19 or SDK 7.0.119 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/7.0.\r\n\r\n.NET 7.0 and, .NET 8.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update. To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty. Details of the Microsoft .NET Bounty Program including terms and conditions are at <https://aka.ms/corebounty>.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the .NET GitHub organization.

This transfer will also leverage Canonical expertise with Snap packaging and enhance the design of .NET Snaps for added improvements. Canonical is currently working on creating new .NET Snap packages.\r\n\r\nYou will continue to leverage Snaps to install/update .NET for all the supported .NET versions (currently include .NET 6, .NET 7, and .NET 8). Like the current state, you can use Snap to install .NET SDK and .NET Runtime.\r\n\r\n### Important Dates, Impact, and Call to Action\r\n\r\n1. The ownership transfer of the existing .NET Snaps from Microsoft to Canonical.\r\n\r\n   Date: May 2024 (_Stay tuned for exact date_)\r\n   Impact: No impact on .NET Snap user \r\n   Call to action: No action needed.\r\n\r\n2. Transition from the old Snap packages to the newly built Snaps by Canonical.\r\n\r\n    Impact:\r\n- New Snap will package Canonical-built .NET. As Canonical does not build/publish .2xx and higher SDK feature bands due to breaking changes, new Snap will only support .1xx SDK feature band for the lifetime of a major .NET version.\r\n- .NET previews (.NET 9 previews) will not be available to install via Snap.\r\n\r\n   _Stay tuned for date and call to action to switch from old to new .NET Snaps._\r\n\r\n### Issue Log\r\nAfter ownership is transferred from Microsoft to Canonical in May, log any .NET Snap issues to the dotnet-snap repository under the Canonical org [https://github.com/canonical/dotnet-snap](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcanonical%2Fdotnet-snap&data=05%7C02%7Cashitanagar%40microsoft.com%7Cc5b9b895923f4c11483908dc57efcb4c%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638481934634983274%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=fvusMJ%2Fl94m3WaJvpM7kK85%2BzIXGLsenPt7BmKPtRSU%3D&reserved=0).\r\n\r\n### Important Links\r\n[.NET SDK Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/dotnet-sdk)\r\n[Canonical GitHub Repository](https://github.com/canonical/dotnet-snap)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/304","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Snap Ownership Transfer from Microsoft to Canonical\" (#304)"},{"Id":"2234072927","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-09T18:22:01","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"303","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-21409 | .NET Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-21409 | .NET Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 6.0, .NET 7.0 ,and .NET 8.0.

It’s long been known by security practitioners that any deserializer, binary or text, which allows its input to carry information about the objects to be created is a security problem waiting to happen. There is even a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) that describes the issue, [CWE-502 “Deserialization of Untrusted Data”](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html) and examples of this type of vulnerability run from security issues in Exchange through security issues in Apache. Within Microsoft the use of ``BinaryFormatter`` with untrusted input has caused many instances of heartache, late nights, and weekend work trying to produce a solution.\r\n\r\nIn .NET Core 1.0 we removed ``BinaryFormatter`` entirely due to its known risks, but without a clear path to using something safer customer demand brought it back to .NET Core 1.1. Since then, we have been on the path to removal, slowly turning it off by default in multiple project types but letting you opt-in via flags if you still needed it for backward compatibility. .NET 9 sees the culmination of this effort with the removal of ``BinaryFormatter``. In .NET 9 these flags will no longer exist and the in-box implementation of ``BinaryFormatter`` will throw exceptions in any project type when you try to use it. However, if you are committed to using a class that cannot be made secure you will still be able to.\r\n\r\n## It's not that it’s binary\r\n\r\nWe pick on ``BinaryFormatter`` because of its ubiquitous use, but the problem is not that the payload is binary, the problem is that the payload tells .NET what objects to create. That capability is what makes ``BinaryFormatter`` so popular, you can throw pretty much any class at it, and it will serialize and deserialize it correctly without developers having to do any work. However, it is also what makes it so dangerous.\r\n\r\nThere are classes within .NET which, by design, can run arbitrary code, and if you try to deserialize those through any deserialization code that creates objects based on the payload you end up with “Remote Code Execution” (RCE), a class of security vulnerability that allows the attacker to run their own code within your application, under the privileges your application has.\r\n\r\nThis has been a known problem as far back as 2012, when the Black Hat security conference featured the canonical presentation on .NET’s version of the problem, [Are you my type? Breaking .NET through Serialization, James Forshaw](https://paper.bobylive.com/Meeting_Papers/BlackHat/USA-2012/BH_US_12_Forshaw_Are_You_My_Type_WP.pdf). There’s even a GitHub repository dedicated to hunting and showing these types of attacks in .NET, [https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net](https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net).\r\n\r\nImagine your code has a class DeleteAllMyData. If you accept a payload from untrusted input, for example a web page, an attacker can create a payload that contains an instance of DeleteAllMyData and when you deserialize that payload you will get a chance to discover if your database backups actually restore.\r\n\r\nOther .NET serialization formats (and serialization formats in other languages and frameworks) allow for class information to be passed in a payload, to pick on our own framework ``SoapFormatter``, ``LosFormatter``, ``NetDataContractSerializer`` and ``ObjectStateFormatter`` all exhibit the same dangerous characteristics.\r\n\r\nEven JSON.NET has an opt-in option to allow the creation of a payload that specifies class names, and that is a text format, not a binary one. Other JSON deserializers (both .NET and Java) suffered from the same problem, as demonstrated at Black Hat 2017, [Friday the 13th JSON Attacks, Alvaro Muñoz & Oleksandr Mirosh](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Munoz-Friday-The-13th-JSON-Attacks-wp.pdf).\r\n\r\nYour takeaway should be that there’s nothing inherently wrong with a binary payload, it’s the fact that the ``BinaryFormatter`` payload contains instructions on the classes to be created, and what should go into that class’s properties that make it so dangerous. Other serializers, including some JSON serializers, also have the same ability, making them equally dangerous to use.\r\n\r\n## Real Word Examples of BinaryFormatter security bugs\r\n\r\nWithin Microsoft, ``BinaryFormatter`` has been the cause of a quite a few security problems, including:\r\n\r\n* In Exchange, [CVE-2021-42321](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166153/Microsoft-Exchange-Server-Remote-Code-Execution.html), where a binder had a spelling mistake that led to RCE.\r\n* In Azure DevOps, [CVE-2019-1306](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2019/10/23/cve-2019-1306-are-you-my-index), where invalid MarkDown used ``BinaryFormatter`` and granted RCE.\r\n* In SharePoint, [CVE-2022-22005](https://blog.viettelcybersecurity.com/cve-2022-22005-microsoft-sharepoint-rce-2/), where loading images for charts used ``BinaryFormatter`` and once again lead to RCE.\r\n\r\nThere has been an outright ban on using ``BinaryFormatter`` for new projects at Microsoft for years, and an ongoing effort to remove it from older code for almost as long as the usage ban in new code. We have added code analyzers, warnings, and public documentation, and yet still we see people using it and ending up with RCE bugs. It feels like we need to do more.\r\n\r\n## BinaryFormatter is not fixable\r\n\r\n``BinaryFormatter`` has other problems around algorithmic complexity, unbounded cache growth, and unintended object graph edge manipulation. If we take out one insecure piece, replace it with a secure piece, and keep going until all the insecure pieces are replaced there is not much of the original ``BinaryFormatter`` left. A secure version would have a vastly different API shape and it could not be a drop-in replacement. It would require massive refactoring of application code to use, so, really, would it even be ``BinaryFormatter`` anymore?\r\n\r\nSerialization binders, a type of class used to inspect types during deserialization, are often proposed as a control mechanism to stop ``BinaryFormatter`` doing bad things, but there are code paths in ``BinaryFormatter`` that bypass binders by design, and writing a correct binder that isn’t vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack is extremely hard.\r\n\r\n## The plan for .NET 9\r\n\r\nFor the last few .NET releases newly introduced project types such as Blazor or MAUI projects have been unable to use ``BinaryFormatter`` at all. ASP.NET projects are particularly vulnerable as their entire purpose is to take untrusted input and were also part of the ban. For some, older, project types you have been able to opt into using ``BinaryFormatter`` by setting a flag.\r\n\r\nOur current intentions are:\r\n\r\n1. The in-box implementation of ``BinaryFormatter`` will throw exceptions when you try to use it, even if you set any of the settings that previously enabled its use. We are also removing these settings.\r\n2. A new NuGet package will be provided, (with a suitable name like Microsoft.Unsupported.BinaryFormatter) which you could add to your projects. With a small config change in your app, ``BinaryFormatter`` will appear again, which is useful if you judge the risk of ``BinaryFormatter`` acceptable for your use cases. This NuGet package will be permanently marked as vulnerable so that dependency and code scanners can detect ``BinaryFormatter`` usage easily.\r\n3. We will also provide a safe reader in its own NuGet package. This reader will allow you to read a ``BinaryFormatter`` payload and it will return an object graph describing the payload. Each node in the graph will represent an object in the payload and each edge represents a reference between objects.\r\n\r\nThe safe reader will allow you to evaluate the classes within a ``BinaryFormatter`` payload, providing a representation of the object graph with each node containing information on the object type, and a list of its fields and their values. The node structure we are considering looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class Node\r\n{\r\n    public SomeTypeDescriptor ObjectType;\r\n    public Dictionary<string, object> Fields;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will use a new class for the object type descriptor (whose name is yet to be decided) to impede naïve developers calling ``Type.GetType(theNodeType)`` and reintroducing the same fundamentally insecure behavior that we are trying to stop.\r\n\r\nSay you had had a class ``Customer`` and a class ``Address``, and your customer had a ``ShippingAddress`` and ``BillingAddress``, both of which are properties in the customer class, with a type of ``Address``. The fields within the ``Customer`` object node would be something like ``{ \"ShippingAddress\", node_for_ship_addr }`` and ``{ \"BillingAddress\", node_for_bill_addr }``.\r\n\r\nThis graph will allow you to both validate the types in the payload against types you are expecting and provide data you can use to rehydrate your objects.\r\n\r\n## Preparing for migration\r\n\r\nTo migrate away from ``BinaryFormatter`` is going to take work. There is no drop-in replacement, nor is there a single path that fits everyone because everyone’s classes are different and there are too many varied use cases.\r\n\r\nThe first step to migrating away from ``BinaryFormatter`` should be selecting a new serialization format. Remember that binary representation is safe if the produced payload does not instruct the deserialization process to create types. The same restriction applies to text-based formats.\r\n\r\nAt Microsoft, a lot of teams have moved from ``BinaryFormatter`` to ``[ProtoBuf](https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/csharptutorial/)`` (you will even see some familiar names in the commit history for the C# version). Other teams, whose data is text and where textual representation have advantages like easy searching have moved to JSON.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of choices out there, but we cannot pick a winner for you. Each potential serializer has pluses and minuses, and how you weigh these is a decision only you can make for your application. Factors can include speed, memory consumption, storage costs, whether it is human readable, whether it is standards based and so on.\r\n\r\nThe ideal safe use of the proposed SafeReader class is to perform conversions of existing data into your chosen new serialization format and run this conversion in as much isolation as possible, for example a virtual machine or a container, again analyzing the types in each payload, rehydrating objects, and then reserializing them in your chosen serialization format.\r\n\r\nIf your class properties are primitive types, for example int, bool, or strings then the proposed safe reader could work as part of a replacement deserialization mechanism at runtime, leaving you to do the object rehydration once you have validated the types are those you expect.\r\n\r\nOr, if you accept the risk of Remote Code Execution, or, if you are sure that no-one can tamper with your messages or data (such a promise is extremely hard to make for online systems or for desktop or mobile apps) then you might consider using the proposed NuGet package. If you choose to take this route, please remember that this package is unsupported. We will not fix security issues in ``BinaryFormatter``.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nIf you are using ``BinaryFormatter`` now you should start looking at alternative serialization formats and decide what works for you in your specific circumstance, be it saved object graphs, network transports, temporary round tripped data, or any other type of data.\r\nYou should look at all your saved data and plan to convert any data serialized by ``BinaryFormatter`` into the new serialization format you have chosen.\r\n\r\nYou should evaluate how much backwards compatibility you need, and how long you need it for.\r\n\r\nFinally, you need to get off ``BinaryFormatter``, it is too dangerous to use any more and that is why it is leaving the .NET runtime.\r\n\r\n[Discussion Issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/98245)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/293","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"BinaryFormatter is being removed in .NET 9\" (#293)"},{"Id":"2072888869","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T18:00:52","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"292","RawContent":null,"Title":" Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-0056: Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient SQL Data provider Information Disclosure Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-0056: Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient SQL Data provider Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET's System.Data.SqlClient and Microsoft.Data.SqlClient NuGet Packages.

An attacker could present an arbitrary untrusted certificate with malformed signatures, triggering a bug in the framework. The framework will correctly report that X.509 chain building failed, but it will return an incorrect reason code for the failure. Applications which utilize this reason code to make their own chain building trust decisions may inadvertently treat this scenario as a successful chain build.

This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated client to consume arbitrarily large amounts of server memory, potentially triggering an out-of-memory condition on the server and making the server no longer able to respond to legitimate requests. \r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at  https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/53246\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nThis impacts only .NET Core-based projects that were created using any version of project templates listed in [affected software](#affected-software). \r\nOther project templates e.g., console applications, MAUI applications, Windows Forms or WPF applications, are not affected.\r\n\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\r\n\r\nThis impacts only .NET Core-based projects that were created using any version of the below project templates.\r\n\r\n-\tASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller)\r\n-\tASP.NET Core Web API\r\n-\tASP.NET Core Web App (Razor Pages)\r\n-\tBlazor Server App\r\n-\tBlazor WebAssembly App\r\n\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you are you using project templates listed in [affected software](#affected-software), you may be exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### For existing projects:\r\nIf you ever created any of these projects via the dotnet new command or via Visual Studio's File -> New Project gesture, and if you enabled federated authentication at project creation time, your project may be vulnerable. To remediate the vulnerability, use your package manager to update any references you may have to the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect, and Microsoft.IdentityModel.JsonWebTokens packages to their respective latest versions. \r\n- [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer/) \r\n- [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect/) \r\n\r\nIf your project does not reference any of those three packages, you are not exposed to this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n#### For new projects:\r\nTo remediate this issue please update to the latest SDK listed below. Simply installing the SDK update is not sufficient to remediate projects already-created / already-deployed projects which existed prior to this update being released.\r\n\r\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 6.0 or .NET 7.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\r\n* If you are using one of the affected packages, please update to the patched version listed above.\r\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command.

To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n#### **Fine tuning the patch**\r\nThe patch introduces two new AppContext properties: \r\n\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxEnhanceYourCalmCount `\r\n`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.Http2.MaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize `\r\n\r\nThe properties can be set in a [variety](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime-config/) of ways, including AppContext.SetData or AppDomain.CurrentDomain.SetData in code (the former is not available in 6.0), RuntimeHostConfigurationOption in a project file, or environment variables. \r\n\r\nMaxEnhanceYourCalmCount is a cap on how many ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM (EYC) messages (generally triggered by excessive client stream resets) the server can send per second on a particular connection without dropping it.  The value is averaged over 5 seconds to accommodate bursty clients.  For example, a value of 20 means that if 100 EYCs are recorded in 5 seconds, the connection will be dropped.  If legitimate clients are being disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\nMaxConnectionFlowControlQueueSize is a cap on how large an internal data structure can grow.  Intuitively, it corresponds to the number of outbound messages that are waiting to be sent (because of flow-control limits negotiated between the client and server).  It never makes sense for this value to be less than the number of active streams – it’s fine to have a message waiting on each stream.  Since the default number of active streams is 100 (this is configurable), it’s expected that most servers will use a value of 200 or more.  If legitimate clients are disconnected, you should increase this value.  Alternatively, setting it to 0 (or a negative value) will disable the check entirely. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0, .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 2.1 you should download and install Runtime 2.1.18 or SDK 2.1.515 (for Visual Studio 2017 v15.9), 2.1.612 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.0) or 2.1.807 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.2 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1\r\n* For machines running .NET Core 3.1 you should download and install Runtime 3.1.4 or SDK 3.1.105 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.4) or 3.1.301 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.5 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1\r\n* For machines running .NET 5 Preview you should download and install .NET 5 Preview 4 when available from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple affected versions you must update the runtime or SDKs for each version.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

This is particularly profound in Office extensions since most inherit from `IDispatch`. The fact that this hasn't been reported seems to imply few customers are authoring Office extensions using .NET Core at present. As .NET 5 releases and adoption increases the assumption would be this issue will become more common.\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/38950 for user reported issue.\r\n\r\n.NET 5 PR: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/40228.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from .NET Framework and has been present since COM support was added to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nValidation of the above user scenario and updated tests in .NET 5 to verify the scenario. The test updates did not get ported to this PR but can be if those changes are desired. The minimum updates to tests were applied here to enable build and run of existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nThe risk of this change has two facets. It is possible .NET Core COM server authors have come to rely on this unusual behavior so it is possible we break someone. How that manifests would near impossible to determine given the fact that this is a bug in our following COM rules.\r\n\r\nThe change itself is isolated to COM scenarios only and has no impact on any scenario other than COM servers authored in .NET Core. This seems to be an acceptable risk given that the primary motivation for COM support was for Office and since few (read one) reports of the failure and it does impact the Office scenario the fix to follow the COM rules appears warranted."},{"Id":"13174711185","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-08-11T23:15:56","Actor":"Anipik","Repository":"dotnet/coreclr","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28072","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Fix DataTargetReader::AlignBase()\" (#28072) at dotnet/coreclr","RelatedBody":"## Summary\r\n\r\n#28033 added `DAC_ALIGNAS` macro to force MSVC and clang/gcc compilers layouts to match.

This is particularly profound in Office extensions since most inherit from `IDispatch`. The fact that this hasn't been reported seems to imply few customers are authoring Office extensions using .NET Core at present. As .NET 5 releases and adoption increases the assumption would be this issue will become more common.\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/38950 for user reported issue.\r\n\r\n.NET 5 PR: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/40228.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\nThis is a regression from .NET Framework and has been present since COM support was added to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nValidation of the above user scenario and updated tests in .NET 5 to verify the scenario. The test updates did not get ported to this PR but can be if those changes are desired. The minimum updates to tests were applied here to enable build and run of existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nThe risk of this change has two facets. It is possible .NET Core COM server authors have come to rely on this unusual behavior so it is possible we break someone. How that manifests would near impossible to determine given the fact that this is a bug in our following COM rules.\r\n\r\nThe change itself is isolated to COM scenarios only and has no impact on any scenario other than COM servers authored in .NET Core. This seems to be an acceptable risk given that the primary motivation for COM support was for Office and since few (read one) reports of the failure and it does impact the Office scenario the fix to follow the COM rules appears warranted.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28073","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[.NET Core 3.1] Don't rely on the built-in interface marshaller during COM activation.\" (#28073)"},{"Id":"670175635","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-11T23:15:55","Actor":"sdmaclea","Number":"28072","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix DataTargetReader::AlignBase()","State":"closed","Body":"## Summary\r\n\r\n#28033 added `DAC_ALIGNAS` macro to force MSVC and clang/gcc compilers layouts to match.

When a thread is created coreclr requests for the processor affinity of the new thread to be changed to the process' affinity, which is not allowed under Snap's strict confinement.\r\n- There are a couple of workarounds, but both involve manual/non-default steps (inconvenient) and give the process more control than desired:\r\n  - Specify the process-control plug and manually connect it before running the app\r\n  - Require the classic confinement instead and specify it when installing the app\r\n- The workarounds may also cause some difficulty, especially longer-term, for .NET Core apps to be added to the public snap store due to the extra control the process would require.\r\n  - It is possible to specify to auto-connect the process-control plug using store processes, but it requires review and justification, and the purpose of working around this issue may be difficult to justify longer-term\r\n  - Apps that use the classic confinement run without any sandboxing, and may not be allowed in the public snap store for the purpose of working around this issue\r\n  - See https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/1634#issuecomment-667332468 for more information\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n- Tested a small app under Snap's strict confinement\r\n- PAL, coreclr, and libraries tests\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow:\r\n- Instead of the creating thread changing the affinity of the created thread, the created thread changes its own affinity after starting, the difference is mostly invisible\r\n- Where appropriate, used a fallback to use the pthread implementation for setting the affinity when sched_setaffinity is not available, so in the theoretical possibility of a different pthread implementation for setting the affinity, there would be no change from before","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28071","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[3.1] Change new thread's affinity after thread starts, from the same thread, as a workaround for Snap\" (#28071)"},{"Id":"668934448","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-30T17:04:31","Actor":"silvioguiso","Number":"28069","RawContent":null,"Title":"Decodes bitstream to string","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28069","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Decodes bitstream to string\" (#28069)"},{"Id":"656700055","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-28T23:51:17","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"28057","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/2.1' => 'release/uwp6.2'","State":"closed","Body":"I detected changes in the release/2.1 branch which have not been merged yet to release/uwp6.2.

The managed definition of [`IManagedActivationFactory`](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/68ec8a211852cc9cf662d19bac251f364719702f/src/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Runtime/InteropServices/WindowsRuntime/ManagedActivationFactory.cs#L10-L16) has been pruned of its function and thus when a call is made to a class implementing that interface, random memory is executed since there is no entry in the vtable.\r\n\r\nThe scenario involving this code was [removed in .NET 5.0](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/37672) so there is no need to bring the work forward.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nUsers will be unable to use XAML Islands or WinUI with bindings in .NET 3.1.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\nThere is no work around.

Since the CTR already knows with what token it's associated, allowing you to get the token from the CTR saves you from also needing to separately store the token, which lets you improve memory utilization by not carrying it around effectively twice.  We took advantage of that, for example, in FileStream's Read/WriteAsync operations, to decrease the size of the object allocated for those operations.  However, the CTR.Token property is incorrectly throwing an ObjectDisposedException if the associated CancellationTokenSource has been disposed, which introduces an ODE where there wasn't previously one (just accessing a CancellationToken you already had stored).  This is causing regressions in code that created a token source, registered with its token, and then disposed the source.\r\n\r\n#### Customer Impact\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\nExceptions on background threads that crash the process when performing operations like:\r\n```C#\r\nvar cts = new CancellationTokenSource();\r\nTask<int> t = fileStream.ReadAsync(..., cts.Token);\r\ncts.Dispose();\r\nint result = await t;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe fixed this in 2.2 but so far held off on backporting to 2.1 pending more customer data since it's an LTS release. Since then we've had 2 more reports (see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/37641) most recently a customer that says:\r\n\r\n> It may take the rest of the year to reach 3.1. In the meantime our servers are crashing and clients are getting mad! I can only apologize to them, mitigate the issues as best as possible and then blame you for not updating an LTS version!\r\n\r\nSince the change is very low risk -- it's been in the product since 2.2 -- we are proposing we now backport to 2.1\r\n\r\n#### Regression?\r\n\r\nYes.  It's not a regression in CancellationTokenRegistration.Token, which was only introduced in 2.1, but rather a regression in that it's behavior isn't matching code it was used to replace, so it's for example a regression in FileStream.Read/WriteAsync.\r\n\r\n#### Packaging reviewed? \r\n\r\nChange affects System.Private.CoreLib only.\r\n\r\n#### Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.  The new code is effectively the same as the old, except avoiding a ThrowIfDisposed call.\r\ncc: @danmosemsft ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28053","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/2.1] Fix CancellationTokenRegistration.Token after CTS.Dispose\" (#28053)"},{"Id":"643722922","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-14T22:59:17","Actor":"janvorli","Number":"28051","RawContent":null,"Title":"Port to 3.1 - Fix JIT_CheckedWriteBarrier on macOS","State":"closed","Body":"Port of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/38242\r\n\r\nIn a change to enable Mojave hardened runtime support that was made last\r\nyear, a bug was introduced into the JIT_CheckedWriteBarrier.

On Linux-based environments, customers that explicitly or implicitly use `X509Chain` to build a certificate that cause an AIA fetch and the server improperly responds successfully but with empty content will cause a null pointer dereference in native code, which will result in an unrecoverable hard crash of the runtime.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nYes. Prior to .NET Core 3.0, a managed exception was thrown instead of an access violation.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThe original fix against dotnet/runtime contains a unit test to prevent further regressions. The test is not ported here due to missing testing faculties for AIA fetching.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n**Low**. The fix is to treat empty responses or any other response that results in a certificate with an invalid handle as an invalid response.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/42942","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Ignore 0-byte responses from AIA fetch.\" (#42942)"},{"Id":"643406701","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-14T23:09:15","Actor":"cheenamalhotra","Number":"42937","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Release 3.1] Avoid enlistment of pooled connection in aborted transaction","State":"closed","Body":"Ports https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/551 and https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/543 to System.Data.SqlClient.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\nFixes issue https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues/237 that occurs due to driver enlisting pooled connection in stale transaction which is due abort from SysTx.Transactions on the server. This incorrect enlistment causes server to perform forth-coming operations in implicit mode, causing unwanted commits.\r\n\r\nThe fix ensures if a transaction gets aborted externally, the corresponding connection is not sent back to the pool.\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n**High** This bug causes the driver to perform commits outside transaction even though client is presumably working inside a transaction. It qualifies for a security issue.\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\nNo, this issue is reproducible with all SqlClient drivers.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis issue has not yet been reproduced in .NET Core applications but the driver behavior being same to that of .NET Framework needs to be fixed. The issue happens intermittently and is more likely to happen on SQL Server machines working in heavy load.

The Team had it already running with Mono but was not satisfied with the overall performances. Therefore I was tasked with checking if the performances can be improved or finding an alternative to using Mono. \r\n\r\nAs getting CoreRT working on the XBox was an very easy task I was able to get the core module of our C# code run in a few hours. As it runs more than twice as fast compared to Mono it was decided to go ahead. PlayStation was a little bit more work but it worked after a few days and showed the same performances improvements. Unfortunately while goingon to the Switch I noticed that the ARM64 support was incomplete and using ARM was not an option because of some limitations on the target system. As the team still wanted the performances improvements I started to implement the missing parts. It took some time but I was able to get our test case running and again it was more than twice as fast as the Mono version. It does not use all .Net features therefore there are still parts missing. But as our test test case (around 5MB of C# code) was able to run for hours with the precise GC I assume it is at least a big part.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately priorities changed and this project was put on hold. After things have changed again it was decided to give a switch from Mono to CoreRT a second try. This time I although got the permission to submit anything that does not touch the various NDAs. As you might assume I needed to add code on different places including the jit itself. As anything was done on a now nearly one year old version I need to reintegrate all these changes again. But I'd like to make sure they can easily go back in the main code branch. \r\n\r\nTherefore the question on which of these changes you are interested in and what's your recommended work flow?\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/issues/8236","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ARM64 and cross compile support\" (#8236)"},{"Id":"658291999","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-16T15:29:50","Actor":"ogxd","Number":"8234","RawContent":null,"Title":"Link error 1181 when building the NativeLibrary sample as a shared library","State":"closed","Body":"I just cloned the repository.\r\n\r\nThe C# dll builds fine, but then when I try to compile it as a shared library using : \r\n`dotnet publish /p:NativeLib=Shared -r win-x64 -c Release`\r\n\r\nIt throws the following exception : \r\n`LINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file 'kernel32.lib' [...\\corert\\samples\\NativeLibrary\\NativeLibrary.csproj]\r\n...\\.nuget\\packages\\microsoft.dotnet.ilcompiler\\1.0.0-alpha-29116-02\\build\\Microsoft.NETCore.Native.targets(310,5): error MSB3073: The command \"link  @\"obj\\Release\\netstandard2.0\\win-x64\\native\\link.rsp\"\" exited with code 1181.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.  The benchmarks were run both with and without the microcode update applied.  The graphs below represent the grouping of differences between the benchmarks with and without the microcode update applied.\r\n\r\nAxes:\r\n - X: Ratio of after/before.  Stated another way, the ratio is (withmcu/withoutmcu).  Ratios less than 1 mean the benchmark performed better with the JCC microcode update applied.  Ratios greater than 1 mean the benchmark performed worse with the JCC microcode update applied.\r\n - Y: Count of benchmarks in the bucket.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6210322/80840714-ba0bda80-8bb2-11ea-8869-07ec55182661.png)\r\n**While there are some outliers, for the most part, the benchmarks are clustered around a ratio of 1 with the most benchmarks in the 1.038 – 1.085 bucket, which represents single digit percentage degradation.**","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"JCC Erratum Impact on .NET Core\" (#153)"},{"Id":"583170428","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-17T17:16:09","Actor":"TaraOverfield","Number":"152","RawContent":null,"Title":"March 2020 .NET Updates","State":"open","Body":"The following .NET updates were released on March 2020.

Per the lifecycle policy, Current releases reach end of life 3 months after a subsequent release (Current or LTS). **.NET Core 3.0** released in **September 2019** and began the end of life countdown for .NET Core 2.2 that concluded on December 23, 2019. \r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.2 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.2 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.2, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details  and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/net/platform/support-policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/147","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.2 has reached end of life\" (#147)"},{"Id":"541189878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-20T20:42:33","Actor":"vivmishra","Number":"146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Announcing Availability of Localized IntelliSense for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1","State":"open","Body":"This week we released localized [IntelliSense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense?view=vs-2019) files for .NET Core 3.0 and 3.1, in following 10 Visual Studio supported languages: \r\n- Brazilian Portuguese\r\n- Chinese (simplified)\r\n- Chinese (traditional)\r\n- French\r\n- German\r\n- Italian\r\n- Japanese\r\n- Korean\t\r\n- Russian\r\n- Spanish\r\n\r\nThe files (in zip archives) are available for download from [**Download localized .NET Core IntelliSense files**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/intellisense).\r\n\r\n * [Checksums for 3.0 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.0.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n * [Checksums for 3.1 zip files](https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/checksums/3.1.0-intellisense-sha.txt)\r\n\r\nYou can see [the .NET Core Guide](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-intellisense) for instructions on how to use these files with Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you're developing .NET Core projects, the SDK only includes the English version of the IntelliSense files.

This means some folks will lose their Collaborator badge and the ability to interact with the CI system.*\r\n\r\nOver the years, we’ve added a bunch of folks as collaborators with read permissions to our public repos. The rationale was that we wanted to be able to assign issues to community members because GitHub only allowed assigning issues to users with an explicit permission grant for the repository. However, they changed this in [June 2019](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/). Now, we can assign issues to all users with explicit permissions as well as to users that have commented on the specific issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, we recently started to audit and tighten the permissions for our organizations. As a result, it became clear that large number of repo-specific permission grants are hard to review and audit. Internally, our goal is to grant all permissions via teams instead.\r\n\r\nHence, we plan to remove all collaborators from public repos that only have read permissions (folks with triage permissions will remain). The full list of affected repos is listed below.\r\n\r\nThis shouldn’t impact your ability to work with us, but losing explicit read-only has the following implications:\r\n\r\n-   **You’ll lose the collaborator badge**. We understand that this is visually appealing and for some people it might have been a badge of honor. But given that GitHub also shows a Contributor bade for folks whose PRs got merged, we don’t think it this will be a major take back.    \r\n    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/70491508-43acf580-1ab6-11ea-94df-74ea2dde98b4.png)\r\n\r\n-   ~~**You lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. As a collaborator, you can use comments to [send commands to the CI system](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/project/pullrequest-builds.md). While this can be useful at times, we generally don’t expect (or desire) contributors to do that. Of course, anyone can still access the CI logs.~~\r\n\r\n- **You might lose the ability to interact with the CI system**. Based on your feedback we have decided to give externals access to interact with the CI system *on a case by case basis*. If you believe you need to have that ability, please [leave a comment like Kevin's](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718#issuecomment-563717478).\r\n\r\n| Public Repo                | \\#collaborators with read |\r\n|----------------------------|---------------------------|\r\n| arcade                     | 1                         |\r\n| BenchmarkDotNet            | 11                        |\r\n| cli                        | 2                         |\r\n| command-line-api           | 14                        |\r\n| coreclr                    | 18                        |\r\n| corefx                     | 180                       |\r\n| corefxlab                  | 4                         |\r\n| corert                     | 7                         |\r\n| core-sdk                   | 1                         |\r\n| docs                       | 3                         |\r\n| interactive-window         | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning            | 1                         |\r\n| machinelearning-samples    | 1                         |\r\n| msbuild-language-service   | 1                         |\r\n| runtime                    | 128                       |\r\n| spark                      | 5                         |\r\n| standard                   | 1                         |\r\n| windowsdesktop             | 1                         |\r\n| winforms-datavisualization | 1                         |\r\n| Grand Total                | 381                       |\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nTo discuss this, please comment on the corresponding issue at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/718.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removal of read-collaborator access\" (#144)"},{"Id":"532249858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-03T20:36:29","Actor":"MichaelSimons","Number":"143","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Core `latest` Docker tags updated to 3.1\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos have been updated to reference [.NET Core 3.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-1/).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n \r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n \r\n* [dotnet/dotnet-docker#1337](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/issues/1511)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n* [dotnet-docker#1509](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/1509)\r\n\r\nThe `latest` tags for the [dotnet/core](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet-core) repos are always intended to reference the latest supported version of .NET Core.

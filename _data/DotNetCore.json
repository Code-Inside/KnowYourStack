These packages will be maintained by the .NET team and kept up to date as part of each servicing release for each of the supported .NET versions.\r\n\r\nThese are the package identifiers of the new set of packages to be added:\r\n\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.Preview\r\n\r\n## Implementation Timeline\r\n\r\n1. Publish new .NET packages (Date: May 11, 2022)\r\n1. Create PRs to update dependencies to reference the new .NET packages instead of the deprecated ones (Date: May 11, 2022)\r\n1. Remove the deprecated .NET packages (Date: May 18, 2022)\r\n\r\n## Package Installation Instructions\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid compatibility issues, you must clean your machine of any existing .NET winget packages that are [listed for removal](#removal-of-existing-winget-packages) prior to installing the [new .NET packages](#new-net-packages).\r\n\r\nOnce you've installed the new .NET packages, upgrade will not work for those packages until a new [winget feature](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/issues/980) is available. To work around this issue, you'll need to force an upgrade to the  specific version that you want:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nwinget upgrade <package-id> --force --version <desired-version>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7428"},{"Id":"21598179327","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-05-03T16:38:05","Actor":"leecow","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/217","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \".NET Package Maintenance (deprecation)\" (#217) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"# .NET Package Maintenance\r\n\r\n.NET Core was released in June 2016, and over the last six years, many thousands of NuGet packages have been published under the .NET umbrella. Many of these packages are legacy or out-of-support already. As things stand today, there is no information associated with these packages to indicate their support status.\r\n\r\nTo provide developers with better package support status information, the .NET team will start using the [**NuGet Package Deprecation feature**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/deprecate-packages). Deprecated packages remain visible on nuget.org, to clients such as Visual Studio and the .NET CLI, and can be restored by projects. In addition to updating existing packages, we will mark packages as appropriate when new versions are released so that developers can access up-to-date information on the packages they use.\r\n\r\n## Which Packages will be deprecated\r\n\r\nAs a general principle, packages that are out of support per the [.NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy) will be marked deprecated. Packages that were part of abandoned projects, such as dnx, will be marked deprecated, as will packages that were part of earlier preview releases.\r\n\r\nAfter we are caught up marking previously released packages, we will update packages when new versions are released. For example, when .NET 6.0.10 releases, package versions for 6.0.9 will be marked deprecated.\r\n\r\nAspNetCore 2.2 is a unique category, particularly around .NET Framework usage. We will work out how best to address these packages getting caught up and staying current at each release.\r\n\r\n## Timing\r\n\r\nWe would like to begin the package marking process next week and first want to hear if there are any issues that have not been considered. Please see the [.NET Package Deprecation list](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/net-package-deprecation.md) and use issue https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7420 to comment."},{"Id":"21274785894","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-04-13T17:28:34","Actor":"mthalman","Repository":"dotnet/announcements","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/216","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Breaking Change: Revert the Console Formatter Default in .NET 6 Container Images\" (#216) at dotnet/announcements","RelatedBody":"In the .NET 6 `aspnet` container images we made the decision to default the console logger in `CreateDefaultBuilder()` to structured JSON logs in order to support container environments where folks use tools like fluentd or Azure Monitor to collect those logs.

This is a release valve only intended for users who make heavy use of AssemblyLoadContext and are experiencing exceptions from this code path.

Partner team validation and local testing of various scenarios showed that for specific use cases, it is sufficient.\r\n\r\nBelow is a collection of sample scenarios and the results of the traces when viewed in PerfView:\r\n\r\n### Multiple manifest `EventSource`s with the _same_ layouts\r\n```csharp\r\n\t[EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class A : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent() => WriteEvent(1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class AA : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent() => WriteEvent(1);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nResult: All events are received and correctly parsed\r\n\r\n### Multiple manifest `EventSource`s with _different_ layouts\r\n```csharp\r\n\t[EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class A : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent(int foo = 1) => WriteEvent(1, foo);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [EventSource(Name=\"AA\")]\r\n    public sealed class AA : EventSource\r\n    {\r\n        public void MyEvent(string foo = \"foo\") => WriteEvent(1, foo);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults: The last manifest received by PerfView is the one that gets used, so the `int` version of `MyEvent` gets parsed as the `string` version.

I also eliminated the possibility that there is something wrong with my where clause (logic) because it works perfectly on 4.6.1 EF Core 2.2.6. Furthermore, I confirmed that it is only where I am comparing a nullable type using that function and I am guessing that I missed a thread someone opened on this issue. I am aware .NET core 2.2 is not LTS. I also thought this goes here because it's not AFAIK, an EF core issue but rather an Ienumerable/Linq issue.\r\n\r\nUpdate: As it turns out your notion of `DateTime.Now` getting evaluated twice is true. To rectify that, I will now be using `DateTime.Now.Date`. This is odd because this exact code works on 4.6.1. You're probably right. SMH. Thank you @GrabYourPitchforks! You may now close.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1792","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"linq using GetValueOrDefault  in Where clause problem\" (#1792)"},{"Id":"894396747","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-07-28T22:25:27","Actor":"SiberaIndustries","Number":"1789","RawContent":null,"Title":"Strong name signature not valid","State":"closed","Body":"Since I've ported a ClickOnce application from .NET Framework 4.6.1 to .NET Standard 2.0, the message _\"Strong assembly name signature not valid for **Microsoft.SqlServer.Assessment.Types.dll**\"_ appears when trying to install or update the application.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly \r\n                 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0\"\r\n\r\n2.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help.

And the changes are identical to those in the other backports.\r\n\r\n# Regression\r\n\r\nThis is not a regression.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43141","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/2.1] Fix ReadOnlySequence created out of sliced Memory owned by MemoryManager\" (#43141)"},{"Id":"1224389900","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-03T19:24:35","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43143","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.26","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43143","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.26\" (#43143)"},{"Id":"1202264239","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-13T04:53:34","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43142","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merging internal commits for release/3.1","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43142","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Merging internal commits for release/3.1\" (#43142)"},{"Id":"1193653850","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-05T21:51:59","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43140","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.25","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43140","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.25\" (#43140)"},{"Id":"1193635046","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-05T20:08:46","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43139","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.25","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43139","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.25\" (#43139)"},{"Id":"1170308034","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-15T21:59:36","Actor":"Mr-Tao","Number":"43138","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Add missing Oracle RIDs","State":"open","Body":"This change adds previously missing RIDs for OL releases 7, 8 and 9 and respective RHEL counterparts.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43138","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/3.1] Add missing Oracle RIDs\" (#43138)"},{"Id":"1027406235","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-14T18:14:44","Actor":"ManickaP","Number":"43116","RawContent":null,"Title":"[H/2] Split lock to prevent deadlock in WindowUpdate processing","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/48220 also in 3.1\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nDeadlock in HTTP/2 - when a window update (WINDOW_UPDATE frame) is received at the same time as the HTTP/2 request is being completed.\r\nWe saw the very same problem in 5.0 in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/48220 (reported by customer) and fixed it in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47769 for .NET 5.0.\r\n\r\nThe problem lies in firstly locking connection sync object and then stream's (window update) while request completions attempts to lock stream and than connection.\r\n\r\nIn 5.0 (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47769), we've split `Http2Stream` lock into 2 objects, one for the stream itself (used for completion etc.) and other for credit handling (window updates and sent bytes counting).\r\nIn 3.1, `Http2Stream` looks slightly different and uses credit manager's sync object as stream's sync object. So redefining stream's sync object to lock over `this` achieves the same thing as the fix in 5.0 since operations over `Http2Stream` are guarded with stream's lock and operations with credit lock credit manager itself (separate sync object for window updates and sent bytes counting).\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nReliability problem.\r\nReported by customer using YARP. They are hitting it for specific backend server (likely due to timing). Temporary workaround is to disable HTTP/2 for the endpoint - such solution does not scale for larger number of backends and might not be acceptable for other backends.\r\n\r\n### Regression\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow.\r\n\r\nLocal test run for 3.1.\r\nWhen we fixed the issue in 5.0, we got a confirmation from the reporting customer that the fix helped and that it didn't break anything.\r\nYARP customer needing the 3.1 fix is unable to verify the fix on unsigned binaries.\r\n\r\n### Link to PR / issue in main\r\n\r\nIssue: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/48220\r\n6.0 (main) PR: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47769\r\n5.0.5 servicing PR: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47921\r\n\r\n### Is there a packaging impact?\r\n\r\nNo","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43116","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[H/2] Split lock to prevent deadlock in WindowUpdate processing\" (#43116)"},{"Id":"1157840655","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-14T17:41:49","Actor":"carlossanlop","Number":"43135","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use .Open queues in public PRs, non-open in internal","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/65741\r\n\r\nI had to update some queues based on the [platforms supported for 3.1](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1-supported-os.md):\r\n  - Windows 19H1 to 20H2\r\n  - MacOS 1013 and 1014 to 1015 and 1100\r\n\r\nMade sure all the queue names matched something that existed here: https://helix.dot.net/\r\n\r\nThe sample run is here: https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=1641884&view=results\r\n\r\nKudos to @hoyosjs for helping me find the right places to change.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43135","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Use .Open queues in public PRs, non-open in internal\" (#43135)"},{"Id":"1114496999","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-11T23:53:09","Actor":"bartonjs","Number":"43132","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Backport cert test updates to avoid macOS issues","State":"closed","Body":"Backport https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/48460 to release/3.1 so the tests don't fail on Apple systems that no longer trust the relevant root authority.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43132","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Backport cert test updates to avoid macOS issues\" (#43132)"},{"Id":"1082811783","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-03-11T02:39:11","Actor":"ayakael","Number":"43129","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1]Add RID for Alpine 3.15","State":"closed","Body":"Contributes to dotnet/core#6985\r\nI havn't seen this popup yet, so here is a merge request to add RID for Alpine 3.15.

Publish new .NET packages (Date: May 11, 2022)\r\n1. Create PRs to update dependencies to reference the new .NET packages instead of the deprecated ones (Date: May 11, 2022)\r\n1. Remove the deprecated .NET packages (Date: May 18, 2022)\r\n\r\n## Package Installation Instructions\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid compatibility issues, you must clean your machine of any existing .NET winget packages that are [listed for removal](#removal-of-existing-winget-packages) prior to installing the [new .NET packages](#new-net-packages).\r\n\r\nOnce you've installed the new .NET packages, upgrade will not work for those packages until a new [winget feature](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/issues/980) is available. To work around this issue, you'll need to force an upgrade to the  specific version that you want:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nwinget upgrade <package-id> --force --version <desired-version>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7428","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/218","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Breaking Change to .NET Packages on Winget\" (#218)"},{"Id":"1224334047","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-03T16:38:05","Actor":"leecow","Number":"217","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET Package Maintenance (deprecation)","State":"open","Body":"# .NET Package Maintenance\r\n\r\n.NET Core was released in June 2016, and over the last six years, many thousands of NuGet packages have been published under the .NET umbrella. Many of these packages are legacy or out-of-support already. As things stand today, there is no information associated with these packages to indicate their support status.\r\n\r\nTo provide developers with better package support status information, the .NET team will start using the [**NuGet Package Deprecation feature**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/nuget-org/deprecate-packages). Deprecated packages remain visible on nuget.org, to clients such as Visual Studio and the .NET CLI, and can be restored by projects. In addition to updating existing packages, we will mark packages as appropriate when new versions are released so that developers can access up-to-date information on the packages they use.\r\n\r\n## Which Packages will be deprecated\r\n\r\nAs a general principle, packages that are out of support per the [.NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy) will be marked deprecated. Packages that were part of abandoned projects, such as dnx, will be marked deprecated, as will packages that were part of earlier preview releases.\r\n\r\nAfter we are caught up marking previously released packages, we will update packages when new versions are released. For example, when .NET 6.0.10 releases, package versions for 6.0.9 will be marked deprecated.\r\n\r\nAspNetCore 2.2 is a unique category, particularly around .NET Framework usage. We will work out how best to address these packages getting caught up and staying current at each release.\r\n\r\n## Timing\r\n\r\nWe would like to begin the package marking process next week and first want to hear if there are any issues that have not been considered. Please see the [.NET Package Deprecation list](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/net-package-deprecation.md) and use issue https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7420 to comment.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/217","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Package Maintenance (deprecation)\" (#217)"},{"Id":"1203587106","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-13T17:28:33","Actor":"mthalman","Number":"216","RawContent":null,"Title":"Breaking Change: Revert the Console Formatter Default in .NET 6 Container Images","State":"open","Body":"In the .NET 6 `aspnet` container images we made the decision to default the console logger in `CreateDefaultBuilder()` to structured JSON logs in order to support container environments where folks use tools like fluentd or Azure Monitor to collect those logs.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-1/) was shipped in May 30, 2018 and was declared an LTS release with the 2.1.3 update in August 2018. The 3-year lifecycle for the 2.1 release has come to an end on August 21, 2021.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.1 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.1 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.1, will be accessible through the [.NET Downloads](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) page. \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and support details and background can be seen in the following:\r\n\r\n* [.NET Core Support Lifecycle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy)\r\n* [Microsoft Support for .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/microsoft-support.md)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/os-lifecycle-policy.md)\r\n* [Support and Versioning](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/07/26/net-support-and-versioning/)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/199","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET Core 2.1 has reached end of life\" (#199)"},{"Id":"974082248","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-08-18T21:49:10","Actor":"terrajobst","Number":"198","RawContent":null,"Title":"Main is now targeting .NET 7","State":"open","Body":"This is a heads up that the primary repos of the stack have branched for .NET 6 GA/servicing/RCs, and that the `main` branch for those repos has become .NET 7.\r\n\r\n## Anything special to note about .NET 7?\r\n\r\nThe biggest difference between .NET 6 and .NET 7 flow is that the SDK repos will have their own channel (.NET 7.0.1xx SDK) from the very beginning.

You should see an output like the following:\r\n\r\n```txt\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   3.1.100\r\n Commit:    cd82f021f4\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\3.1.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.0\r\n  Commit:  65f04fb6db\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  3.1.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n* If you're using .NET 5.0, you should download and install Runtime 5.0.9 or SDK 5.0.206 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.8) or SDK 5.0.303 (for Visual Studio 2019 V16.10) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/5.0.\r\n\r\n* If you're using .NET Core 3.1, you should download and install Runtime 3.1.18 or SDK 3.1.118 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.4) or 3.1.412 (for Visual Studio 2019 v16.7 or later) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1.\r\n\r\n* If you're using .NET Core 2.1, you should download and install Runtime 2.1.30 or SDK 2.1.526 (for Visual Studio 2019 v15.9) or 2.1.818 from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.1.\r\n\r\nIf your application is using .NET Core 2.1 running on .NET Framework see the [Updating .NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework](#updating-2.1) section below.\r\n\r\n.NET 5.0, .NET Core 3.1 and .NET Core 2.1 updates are also available from Microsoft Update. To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"updating-2.1\"></a> Updating .NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework\r\nIf you are running .NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework you need to check your projects for dependencies and update them accordingly.\r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies\r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your `csproj` file. They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, search for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` and update the package to the latest version\r\n\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer/2.1.0` is a reference to version 2.1.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\" Version=\"2.1.1 />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` version 2.1.1\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\" Version=\"2.1.30\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\n* If your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer\" Version=\"2.1.30\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n* We service .NET Core 2.1 incrementally. This means that users who reference the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI` package must add a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`.\r\n\r\n* The shared framework for .NET Core 3.1 and later does not include `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.dll`. Users targeting netcoreapp3.1 or later must also update their `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` package version.\r\n\r\n* We service .NET Core 3.1 and later completely. This means users who reference `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI` can bump that version to 2.1.30. They don't need a new `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` reference.\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core or .NET 5, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

It appears that the issue is sensitive to the user region.\r\n\r\nThere is no workaround using Azure DevOps.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/192","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \".NET Download Site Outage\" (#192)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1529871541701206016","CreatedAt":"2022-05-26T17:06:13+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"We're now live doing API reviews. https://t.co/lXY8t8X5z6","Source":"<a href=\"https://restream.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restream.io</a>","RetweetCount":14,"FavoriteCount":5,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1529196795242348544","CreatedAt":"2022-05-24T20:25:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Set your session reminder to tour how #VisualStudio and #dotNETMAUI can team up to help you create powerful, native… https://t.co/FLbLQJSBbI","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod1.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publishing</a>","RetweetCount":57,"FavoriteCount":19,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1529146586441297921","CreatedAt":"2022-05-24T17:05:31+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"We're now live doing API reviews. https://t.co/lXY8t8X5z6","Source":"<a href=\"https://restream.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restream.io</a>","RetweetCount":23,"FavoriteCount":3,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1529118775794188289","CreatedAt":"2022-05-24T15:15:00+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Microsoft Build 2022 is streaming live now. \n\nJoin us https://t.co/ek5CFvZaOv","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod1.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publishing</a>","RetweetCount":67,"FavoriteCount":27,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1528821978098028548","CreatedAt":"2022-05-23T19:35:38+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"‼️ Introducing .NET MAUI ‼️ \nOne Codebase, Many Platforms\n\nNow, you and 5 million+ other .NET devs have a first-cla… https://t.co/q1Ne06b0Ra","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod1.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publishing</a>","RetweetCount":648,"FavoriteCount":259,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1528741293568008193","CreatedAt":"2022-05-23T14:15:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Microsoft Build streams live tomorrow starting at 8:30 AM PDT.\n\nLet's come together to explore the latest innovatio… https://t.co/KBcmy1ADPH","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod1.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publishing</a>","RetweetCount":43,"FavoriteCount":20,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1528392247108063232","CreatedAt":"2022-05-22T15:08:02+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"On June 2nd, at 08:30 AM PT / 16:30 UTC, learn from #dotNETMAUI experts @maddymontaquila, @davidortinau, and… https://t.co/eHcdl1vNIC","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod1.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publishing</a>","RetweetCount":52,"FavoriteCount":16,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1527788769964965889","CreatedAt":"2022-05-20T23:10:02+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"How do you know your open source is secure? \n\n#dotNETRocks talks to Jillian Ratliff about security practices on you… https://t.co/4Tc1tLbZgE","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod1.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publishing</a>","RetweetCount":30,"FavoriteCount":5,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1527745233294921729","CreatedAt":"2022-05-20T20:17:02+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"In today's episode of the #dotNETCore Podcast, @hurleyIncloud and @socketnorm discuss the AWS Microservice Extracto… https://t.co/BfSpxNpEAR","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod1.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publishing</a>","RetweetCount":30,"FavoriteCount":10,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1527700938399662081","CreatedAt":"2022-05-20T17:21:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"In the final episode of our series on #EntityFramework for Beginners, @camsoper discusses how to code along with th… https://t.co/J59Vfi3JzK","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod1.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publishing</a>","RetweetCount":28,"FavoriteCount":8,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1527656696633499652","CreatedAt":"2022-05-20T14:25:13+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Come together at Microsoft Build May 24–26, to explore the latest innovations in code and application development—a… https://t.co/CzQpKtnmql","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod1.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publishing</a>","RetweetCount":26,"FavoriteCount":7,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1527427131130650624","CreatedAt":"2022-05-19T23:13:00+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Wouldn't it be great if we could build services once in #ASPNETCore and get gRPC and REST?

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across the .NET framework. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

diagnostics","State":"open","Body":"Follow up to #78688\n\nCurrently the diagnostics we are reporting are only on build, which means the file needs to be saved first.  @DamianEdwards observed that particularly when auto-save is off, there are clunky diagnostics in the editor, which can linger even when they are no longer meaningful:\n<img width=\"1562\" height=\"294\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4f106cc-8c14-4182-8c80-ab7307bc7009\" />\n\nWhat we really want is for these diagnostics to be live, and to be reported based on the latest contents of the buffer in-memory. An analyzer might be the best way to do this, though, I think we had reasons when we first implemented this to avoid doing that.\n\nThis is also bottlenecked by run-api currently taking path to .cs file, which means the content we want to report any diagnostics about needs to be save to disk.\n\nI believe we had a plan to \"relocate\" the functionality provided by run-api, possibly to a source package in SDK repo, exposing APIs to obtain virtual project and/or directive diagnostics. We were inclined to do this in such a way that we **assume that latest VS Code extension is being used in combination with latest SDK**. Do not bend over backwards trying to support old SDKs with new extensions or vice-versa--that contortion was part of why we had first broken run-api out as a separate process. That is my best recollection of conversations with @jaredpar from a while back.\n\nI think we are also facing a question of: since roslyn flows into SDK, is it possible for SDK to flow a source-only package into roslyn, i.e. introducing a cycle in the product construction. I am pretty sure this is something we can do, but, would like to consult with folks who understand VMR stuff better.\n\n@jjonescz, @jasonmalinowski for visibility\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/80006","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Live file-based program directive diagnostics\" (#80006)"},{"Id":"3340170023","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-21T18:36:07","Actor":"tmat","Number":"79999","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update SemanticSearch to 18.0.634-alpha (#79996)","State":"closed","Body":"Port to Preview 1","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/79999","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update SemanticSearch to 18.0.634-alpha (#79996)\" (#79999)"},{"Id":"3341094117","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-21T09:55:06","Actor":"SimaTian","Number":"80002","RawContent":null,"Title":"msbuild dogfood","State":"open","Body":"## [msbuild - 12119](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild/issues/12119)\r\n\r\nWe're moving forward with our MSBuild server rollout effort and for that we would like to first dogfood it in our partner repositories.\r\nPlease help me with dogfooding server in roslyn pipelines.\r\nCurrently we've verified that local developer loop is without issue, aspnetcore is dogfooding it for a while now and I've recently managed to get a passing run in sdk so we're relatively confident it is reasonably safe.\r\n\r\nI've looked through the pipeline files and these locations look reasonable.

When a response had a `Content-Encoding: gzip` header, the middleware would inject the script directly into the compressed stream, resulting in corrupted content.\n\n## Changes\n\nThis PR implements proper handling of gzip-compressed responses:\n\n1. **Gzip Detection**: The `OnWrite()` method now detects `Content-Encoding: gzip` headers on HTML responses\n2. **Header Management**: Removes both `Content-Length` and `Content-Encoding` headers when gzip compression is detected\n3. **Streaming Decompression**: Attempts decompression on every write operation to process data as it becomes available\n4. **Graceful Fallback**: If decompression fails (partial data), continues accumulating until complete data is available\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nThe solution processes gzip data incrementally by attempting decompression on each write operation. When a complete gzip stream is available, it decompresses the content, injects the refresh script, and writes the result to the output stream. This approach:\n\n- Minimizes buffering by processing data as soon as possible\n- Handles only gzip compression (ignores brotli, deflate, etc.)\n- Preserves original functionality for uncompressed responses\n- Falls back gracefully for incomplete gzip data\n\n## Testing\n\nAdded test coverage for:\n- Gzip compressed HTML responses (script injection works)\n- Non-HTML gzip responses (unchanged)\n- Non-gzip compression types (treated as regular data)\n- Uncompressed HTML responses (existing functionality)\n\nAll tests pass (64 total).\n\nFixes #50451.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n✨ Let Copilot coding agent [set things up for you](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/new?title=✨+Set+up+Copilot+instructions&body=Configure%20instructions%20for%20this%20repository%20as%20documented%20in%20%5BBest%20practices%20for%20Copilot%20coding%20agent%20in%20your%20repository%5D%28https://gh.io/copilot-coding-agent-tips%29%2E%0A%0A%3COnboard%20this%20repo%3E&assignees=copilot) — coding agent works faster and does higher quality work when set up for your repo.\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/50452","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[BrowserRefresh] Handle gzip-compressed responses in ResponseStreamWrapper\" (#50452)"},{"Id":"3348038958","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-23T11:13:53","Actor":"javiercn","Number":"50451","RawContent":null,"Title":"[BrowserRefresh] Handle the case where the document is already pre-compressed","State":"open","Body":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/aaa06cce0cb61ce6ef628c7ab8e1af7bbf9ab00d/src/BuiltInTools/BrowserRefresh/ResponseStreamWrapper.cs#L113-L135\n\nWhen the browser refresh middleware checks for writes, it doesn't check if the document has a content encoding and corrupts its contents.\n\nOn first write, the stream should check the response content encoding and do the following:\n* Remove the Content-Lengh header.\n* Remove the Content-Encoding header.\n* If the response has a Content-Encoding, create a decompression stream.

`Directory.Build.rsp`","State":"open","Body":"### Describe the bug\nMSBuild supports a `Directory.Build.rsp` convention for adding properties to MSBuild.\n\nWhen using this to specify `-tl:off` it works for most cases, except for `dotnet test`.  In that case only part of the test output is seen (only for a single target framework of a multi-targeted project).\n\nThis has been impacting dotnet/runtime for some time.  It would be nice to have a happy path for folks running tests in our repo.  Either with the terminal logger or without.  See https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/94183\n\n### To Reproduce\nCreate a test project that multi-targets.\nAdd a `Directory.Build.rsp` with `-tl:off`\nrun `dotnet test` on the project.\n\n[xunitTest.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21943644/xunitTest.zip)\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\nNone\n\n### Further technical details\nIssue appears to be here -- https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/55044e9a14e10600c07dcb22ea669b5faad890fc/src/Cli/dotnet/Commands/Test/TestCommand.cs#L102\n\nTo fix it, I think the SDK would need to crack the RSP.  \n\nI tried to workaround it by also specifying `VsTestUseMSBuildOutput=false` in the RSP but this is ignored (rightly) since MSBuild prioritizes the command line arguments over the RSP.  I also tried to specify in a props with TreatAsLocal, but it didn't seem to help.  I did find that specifying `/p:VsTestUseMSBuildOutput=true` on the commandline (with RSP in place) would work, and behave similarly to `/tl:off` on the commandline, so that makes me wonder if https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/55044e9a14e10600c07dcb22ea669b5faad890fc/src/Cli/dotnet/Commands/Test/TestCommand.cs#L117-L125 is still needed.\n\nI do see that https://github.com/Microsoft/vstest/issues/1503 is resolved, so maybe SDK can just delete this workaround?\n\n@nohwnd  @baronfel \n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/50441","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Broken Test output when specifying `-tl:off` in `Directory.Build.rsp`\" (#50441)"},{"Id":"3346161259","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-22T17:52:26","Actor":"marcpopMSFT","Number":"50439","RawContent":null,"Title":"Match the workloads version to the implicit versino","State":"closed","Body":"RC1 is go live so the implicit version is go live.

These changes expand the program’s scope, simplify the award structure, and offer great incentives for security researchers.\n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now offers awards up to **$40,000 USD** for vulnerabilities impacting the .NET and ASP.NET Core (including Blazor and Aspire).  \n\nFor full terms please see the [MSRC .NET Bug Bounty terms and conditions](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/bounty-dot-net-core).\n\n### Program scope expansion \n\nThe .NET Bounty Program now provides broader coverage across .NET. It includes:\n\n- All supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET \n- Adjacent technologies such as Aspire and F#\n- Supported versions[^insupport] of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework\n- Templates provided with supported versions[^insupport] of .NET and ASP.NET Core\n- GitHub Actions in the .NET and ASP.NET Core repositories\n\nThese updates ensure continuous security review and protection for Microsoft customers across a wider range of technologies.\n\n[^insupport]: Supported versions can be found at [.NET Lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)\n\n### Reporting a Vulnerability\nTo potentially qualify for a bounty security issues and bugs should be reported privately to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), either by emailing [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) or via the portal at https://msrc.microsoft.com/. You should receive a response within 24 hours.\n\nSecurity bugs and issues opened via GitHub issues do not qualify for the bug bounty program.\n\n### Awards structure update \nThe restructured .NET Bounty Program introduces several improvements to how submissions are evaluated and rewarded. The new award tables now clearly define severity levels, specify different types of security impacts, and outline revised criteria for report quality.\n\n**Clear severity levels**: Awards are now based on the potential impact of a vulnerability, ensuring higher-impact issues receive greater rewards.\n\n**Aligned impact categories**: Security impact types now match those used in other Microsoft bounty programs, helping researchers understand how their submissions will be assessed.\n\n**Defined report quality**: Submissions are rated as either “complete” or “not complete.” Only reports that include fully functional exploits qualify as “complete.” Theoretical scenarios are still considered but receive lower awards based on practical impact.\n\nThese updates promote transparency and encourage detailed, actionable submissions that help improve the security of the .NET ecosystem.\n\n### Increased award amounts \n\nWe’ve increased the award amounts to better reflect the complexity of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities within .NET.\n\n| Security Impact        | Report Quality  | Critical | Important |\n|:-----------------------|:----------------|---------:|---------:|\n| Remote Code Execution\t | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $30,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $20,000   |\n| Elevation of Privilege | Complete\t  | $40,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Security Feature Bypass| Complete\t  | $30,000  | $10,000   |\n|                        | Not Complete\t  | $20,000  | $4,000    |\n| Remote Denial of Service | Complete | $20,000 |$10,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $15,000 |$4,000 |\n|Spoofing or Tampering | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 |$3,000 |\n| Information Disclosure | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 |\n| | Not Complete | $7,000 | $3,000 |\n| Documentation or samples [^documentation] | Complete | $10,000 | $5,000 | \n|| Not Complete\t| $7,000 |$3,000 |\n\n[^documentation]: Only documentation or samples included in documentation which are insecure or encourage insecurity and are not described as samples which do not take security into consideration \n\nThank you to our researchers and collaborators for your continued partnership.

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10. In addition, expect a deep-dive blog post about the effort some time mid-summer.\n\nFollow along at https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet!","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/359","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unified Build Progress and Preview 4 Milestone\" (#359)"},{"Id":"3060874369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-13T18:20:26","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"358","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 10 Preview 4","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9886.

<a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\n* You can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET SDK:\n Version:           9.0.100\n Commit:            59db016f11\n Workload version:  9.0.100-manifests.3068a692\n MSBuild version:   17.12.7+5b8665660\n\nRuntime Environment:\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\n OS Version:  15.2\n OS Platform: Darwin\n RID:         osx-arm64\n Base Path:   /usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.100/\n\n.NET workloads installed:\nThere are no installed workloads to display.\nConfigured to use loose manifests when installing new manifests.\n\nHost:\n  Version:      9.0.0\n  Architecture: arm64\n  Commit:       9d5a6a9aa4\n\n.NET SDKs installed:\n  9.0.100 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk]\n\n.NET runtimes installed:\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 9.0.0 [/usr/local/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\n\nOther architectures found:\n  x64   [/usr/local/share/dotnet]\n    registered at [/etc/dotnet/install_location_x64]\n\nEnvironment variables:\n  Not set\n\nglobal.json file:\n  Not found\n\nLearn more:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\n\nDownload .NET:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0.4  Runtime or .NET 9.0.105 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 9.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

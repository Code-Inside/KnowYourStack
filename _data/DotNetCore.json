The compiler is generating one set of fields to store the initial arguments to the method, and then another set of fields used as the values of those arguments inside a given enumeration of the enumerable, e.g. the entry point method does this:\r\n```C#\r\nprivate static IEnumerable<U> Select<T, U>(IEnumerable<T> source, Func<T, U> func)\r\n{\r\n    <Select>d__0<T, U> <Select>d__ = new <Select>d__0<T, U>(-2);\r\n    <Select>d__.<>3__source = source;\r\n    <Select>d__.<>3__func = func;\r\n    return <Select>d__;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand then `GetEnumerator` does this:\r\n```C#\r\nIEnumerator<U> IEnumerable<U>.GetEnumerator()\r\n{\r\n    <Select>d__0<T, U> <Select>d__;\r\n    if (<>1__state == -2 && <>l__initialThreadId == Environment.CurrentManagedThreadId)\r\n    {\r\n        <>1__state = 0;\r\n        <Select>d__ = this;\r\n    }\r\n    else\r\n    {\r\n        <Select>d__ = new <Select>d__0<T, U>(0);\r\n    }\r\n    <Select>d__.source = <>3__source;\r\n    <Select>d__.func = <>3__func;\r\n    return <Select>d__;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThat duplication makes sense if the body of the iterator overwrites the parameter, since the parameter needs to return to its original value for subsequent enumeration.  But if the parameter is never mutated by the method body, as is the case in this example, such duplication isn't required.  The compiler should be able to detect the lack of such mutation at least in common cases, like reference types, readonly structs, or structs that only have readonly members invoked on them.\r\n\r\nIn this particular example, such an improvement would end up removing two fields from the iterator object and reducing its size by 16 bytes on 64-bit."},{"Id":"27916026834","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-03-23T02:09:43","Actor":"stephentoub","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/67456","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Async/iterator state machine <>1__state field can be smaller in most cases\" (#67456) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"In both async state machines and iterators, the compiler emits a field on the state machine type:\r\n```C#\r\npublic int <>1__state;\r\n```\r\nThis field is always emitted as an `Int32`.  However, the number of states is typically very small, e.g. one per yield return / await plus a few for known conditions (e.g. -1 for starting / executing, -2 for completed).  It's very rare for the number of states to be larger than, say, 127.  Rather than always using an `Int32`, the compiler could choose to use the smallest data type that will hold all of the values, e.g. if only the states -2 through 40 are needed, it could instead emit the field as:\r\n```C#\r\npublic sbyte <>1__state;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe benefit of this is _possibly_ smaller state machine objects, depending on what all of the other fields are.  For example, consider a method like LINQ's `Select`:\r\n```C#\r\nstatic IEnumerable<U> Select<T,U>(IEnumerable<T> source, Func<T, U> func)\r\n{\r\n    foreach (T item in source)\r\n        yield return func(item);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nToday this will produce the following fields on the state machine type:\r\n```C#\r\nprivate int <>1__state;\r\nprivate U <>2__current;\r\nprivate int <>l__initialThreadId;\r\nprivate IEnumerable<T> source;\r\npublic IEnumerable<T> <>3__source;\r\nprivate Func<T, U> func;\r\npublic Func<T, U> <>3__func;\r\nprivate IEnumerator<T> <>7__wrap1;\r\n```\r\nIf we ignore the reference type fields, which will be 4 bytes on 32-bit or 8 bytes on 64-bit, we get:\r\n```C#\r\nprivate int <>l__initialThreadId;\r\nprivate int <>1__state;\r\nprivate U <>2__current;\r\n```\r\nNo matter what `U` is, it'll always result in the state machine type being at least 8 bytes larger (on 64-bit) than it would otherwise need to be if it didn't have to store `U`.  But, the `<>1__state` field for this state machine is only ever assigned the values -3, -1, and 1, so the field could instead be an `sbyte`:\r\n```C#\r\nprivate int <>l__initialThreadId;\r\nprivate sbyte <>1__state;\r\nprivate U <>2__current;\r\n```\r\nIf it were, and if `U` were <= 3 bytes in size (e.g. if `U` were a `byte` or `char`), then the object wouldn't need to be any bigger to store `U`, as it would be packed to fit into the padding space left from the state, thus reducing the size of the state machine object by 8 bytes on 64-bit."},{"Id":"27915871341","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-03-23T01:58:00","Actor":"Cosifne","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/67455","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Add inline hints options to lsp\" (#67455) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"27915789585","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-03-23T01:51:20","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/67454","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Compute new brace-pair tags when the view is scrolled\" (#67454) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"27915325363","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-03-23T01:10:43","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/67452","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Merge main to main-vs-deps\" (#67452) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"\nThis is an automatically generated pull request from main into main-vs-deps.\n\n\nOnce all conflicts are resolved and all the tests pass, you are free to merge the pull request. 🐯\n\n## Troubleshooting conflicts\n\n### Identify authors of changes which introduced merge conflicts\nScroll to the bottom, then for each file containing conflicts copy its path into the following searches:\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/main\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/main-vs-deps\n\nUsually the most recent change to a file between the two branches is considered to have introduced the conflicts, but sometimes it will be necessary to look for the conflicting lines and check the blame in each branch.

As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The compiler is generating one set of fields to store the initial arguments to the method, and then another set of fields used as the values of those arguments inside a given enumeration of the enumerable, e.g. the entry point method does this:\r\n```C#\r\nprivate static IEnumerable<U> Select<T, U>(IEnumerable<T> source, Func<T, U> func)\r\n{\r\n    <Select>d__0<T, U> <Select>d__ = new <Select>d__0<T, U>(-2);\r\n    <Select>d__.<>3__source = source;\r\n    <Select>d__.<>3__func = func;\r\n    return <Select>d__;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand then `GetEnumerator` does this:\r\n```C#\r\nIEnumerator<U> IEnumerable<U>.GetEnumerator()\r\n{\r\n    <Select>d__0<T, U> <Select>d__;\r\n    if (<>1__state == -2 && <>l__initialThreadId == Environment.CurrentManagedThreadId)\r\n    {\r\n        <>1__state = 0;\r\n        <Select>d__ = this;\r\n    }\r\n    else\r\n    {\r\n        <Select>d__ = new <Select>d__0<T, U>(0);\r\n    }\r\n    <Select>d__.source = <>3__source;\r\n    <Select>d__.func = <>3__func;\r\n    return <Select>d__;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThat duplication makes sense if the body of the iterator overwrites the parameter, since the parameter needs to return to its original value for subsequent enumeration.  But if the parameter is never mutated by the method body, as is the case in this example, such duplication isn't required.  The compiler should be able to detect the lack of such mutation at least in common cases, like reference types, readonly structs, or structs that only have readonly members invoked on them.\r\n\r\nIn this particular example, such an improvement would end up removing two fields from the iterator object and reducing its size by 16 bytes on 64-bit.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/67457","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Iterator state machines frequently have unnecessary duplicate fields\" (#67457)"},{"Id":"1636737049","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-23T02:09:42","Actor":"stephentoub","Number":"67456","RawContent":null,"Title":"Async/iterator state machine <>1__state field can be smaller in most cases","State":"open","Body":"In both async state machines and iterators, the compiler emits a field on the state machine type:\r\n```C#\r\npublic int <>1__state;\r\n```\r\nThis field is always emitted as an `Int32`.  However, the number of states is typically very small, e.g. one per yield return / await plus a few for known conditions (e.g. -1 for starting / executing, -2 for completed).  It's very rare for the number of states to be larger than, say, 127.  Rather than always using an `Int32`, the compiler could choose to use the smallest data type that will hold all of the values, e.g. if only the states -2 through 40 are needed, it could instead emit the field as:\r\n```C#\r\npublic sbyte <>1__state;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe benefit of this is _possibly_ smaller state machine objects, depending on what all of the other fields are.  For example, consider a method like LINQ's `Select`:\r\n```C#\r\nstatic IEnumerable<U> Select<T,U>(IEnumerable<T> source, Func<T, U> func)\r\n{\r\n    foreach (T item in source)\r\n        yield return func(item);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nToday this will produce the following fields on the state machine type:\r\n```C#\r\nprivate int <>1__state;\r\nprivate U <>2__current;\r\nprivate int <>l__initialThreadId;\r\nprivate IEnumerable<T> source;\r\npublic IEnumerable<T> <>3__source;\r\nprivate Func<T, U> func;\r\npublic Func<T, U> <>3__func;\r\nprivate IEnumerator<T> <>7__wrap1;\r\n```\r\nIf we ignore the reference type fields, which will be 4 bytes on 32-bit or 8 bytes on 64-bit, we get:\r\n```C#\r\nprivate int <>l__initialThreadId;\r\nprivate int <>1__state;\r\nprivate U <>2__current;\r\n```\r\nNo matter what `U` is, it'll always result in the state machine type being at least 8 bytes larger (on 64-bit) than it would otherwise need to be if it didn't have to store `U`.

BAsed on, I assume, you're editor configuration it would add a \"{\" on a new line, your insertion point would be tabbed, then your \"}\":\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid DoFoo()\r\n{\r\n    <insertion point>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt some point in recent history, that insertion point changed to, IIRC, right after \"{\". I had to hit return to put it in the \"right\" place, but that was fine. But with this most recent update to 17.6, now it's right in front of \"}\" which breaks IntelliSense since there's no whitespace right after:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid DoFoo()\r\n{\r\n<insertion point>}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is worse because I have to arrow up then over then hit enter. I don't know why it changed in the first place since it seemed perfect before, but it'd be great if this quits changing or, better, goes back to how it used to work. Our repo has a .editorconfig file but that hasn't changed in a _long_ time.\r\n\r\nIt's gotten bad enough that I've now turned off bracket completion in my settings. It's negatively affected my productivity.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Original Comments\r\n\r\n#### Feedback Bot on 3/21/2023, 10:14 PM: \r\n\r\n(private comment, text removed)\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Original Solutions\r\n(no solutions)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/67440","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Please stop changing automatic bracket completion\" (#67440)"},{"Id":"1636492752","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-22T22:17:38","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"67448","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge main to main-vs-deps","State":"closed","Body":"\nThis is an automatically generated pull request from main into main-vs-deps.\n\n\nOnce all conflicts are resolved and all the tests pass, you are free to merge the pull request. 🐯\n\n## Troubleshooting conflicts\n\n### Identify authors of changes which introduced merge conflicts\nScroll to the bottom, then for each file containing conflicts copy its path into the following searches:\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/main\n- https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/main-vs-deps\n\nUsually the most recent change to a file between the two branches is considered to have introduced the conflicts, but sometimes it will be necessary to look for the conflicting lines and check the blame in each branch.

The lifetime of that temp is the `Ref` invocation. Compiler is free to reuse it afterwards. Effectively, we end up with a reference to a memory that is no longer alive.

It should be fine to invoke such methods on expressions classified as variables of struct types. \r\n\r\n\r\n ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/67435","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"A possible ref safety \"hole\" around UnscopedRef method invoked on an expression classified as a value of a struct type \" (#67435)"},{"Id":"1635263613","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-22T08:15:58","Actor":"mavasani","Number":"67434","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove optional parameters from IDiagnosticAnalyzerService","State":"open","Body":"              > > I was trying to stay in line with existing API patterns, lot of which use optional parameters.

IDE informal internal rule is _no optional parameters_ (for non-test-code). We want all callers to think and be clear about wahtt hey want. It also means in a review you know the impact of adding a parameter because you must see everything that was updated. Optional parameters are really bad here because if you add one, and then fixup 3 out of 10 locations, there's no way to realize (without pulling down the PR and manually checking it), that there are 7 other locations that may or may not have had to be updated.\r\n\r\n@CyrusNajmabadi So, I looked at the signatures of methods in IDiagnosticAnalyzerService, and almost all parameters for all the methods are optional: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/main/src/Features/Core/Portable/Diagnostics/IDiagnosticAnalyzerService.cs\r\n\r\nAdding a non-optional bool parameter means it shoots right in front in the parameter order, which doesn't seem appropriate for most of these APIs. This needs a follow-up PR to clean up all the methods in the above file to have no optional parameters, and potential overloads where appropriate. I'll file a tracking issue for this cleanup work.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @mavasani in https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/67351#issuecomment-1479083223_\r\n            ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/67434","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Remove optional parameters from IDiagnosticAnalyzerService\" (#67434)"},{"Id":"1634775731","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-22T07:08:34","Actor":"spadapet","Number":"67428","RawContent":null,"Title":"[MAUI] Roslyn source generator is not run during .NET Hot Reload, triggers rude edit when x:Name is changed","State":"closed","Body":"**Version Used**: .NET 7 or .NET 8.0.100-preview.2.23151.8\r\nI installed .NET 8 using the following internal instructions to get MAUI working.

You should have .NET Hot Reload and XAML Hot Reload options turned on, which is the default.\r\n4. In the VS solution explorer, you should be able to see the MainPage.xaml.sg.cs file that was generated by MAUI's source generator:\r\n    * ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2523431/226753917-ba75a71a-7345-4798-96e0-dc879a8624d6.png)\r\n5.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\n# Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\nBuilding the .NET product from individual product repos in the [dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet) organization is a complex process requiring orchestration infrastructure that is available only to Microsoft. This is a hindrance to the .NET community as it's currently not possible to easily reproduce the official product build in the open. Furthermore, the complexity of the official build and release infrastructure tends to grow over the years. This presents many reliability and sustainability challenges.  \r\n\r\nTo address the abovementioned issues, **we'd like to announce a new repository** - https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet - which is the first step on the way to simplify building and shipping of .NET and making the product build process transparent to and reproducible by the community.\r\n\r\nThis new repository is a **Virtual Monolithic Repository (VMR)**. It includes all the code needed to build the .NET SDK, mirrored from the individual product repos (such as [dotnet/roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) or [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime)). It also includes [source-build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build), our whole-product build system used to build .NET by our Linux partners.\r\n\r\nThe VMR has the following main characteristics:\r\n- **Monolithic** - The repository is monolithic so that a single commit fully identifies the whole source code necessary to build the .NET SDK\r\n- **Virtual** - It's a mirror (not a replacement) of the individual product repos that make up the whole product, placed side-by-side in one repository. Changes to the underlying individual product repositories are synchronized to the VMR.\r\n- **Experimental** - Currently, the repository is part of our initiative to streamline the release process, not meant to be depended on. We reserve the right to delete the current instance and create a new, different one in its stead. We expect the repository to be persistent by the release of .NET 8 Preview 1, planned for February, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe repository is a work-in-progress and has a lot of [limitations](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet#limitations) but we believe that even with these limitations it can be already useful in a variety of scenarios.\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Goals of the Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\n- The main purpose of the [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet) repository is to have all source code necessary to build the .NET product available in one repository and identified by a single commit.\r\n- The VMR also aims to become the place from which we release and service future versions of .NET to reduce the complexity of the product construction process. This should allow our partners and and 3rd parties to easily build, test and modify .NET using their custom infrastructure as well as make the process available to the community.\r\n- Lastly, we hope to solve other problems that the current multi-repo setup brings:\r\n  -  Enable developers to make and test changes spanning multiple repositories.\r\n  -  Fulfill requirements of .NET distro builders such as RedHat or Canonical to natively include .NET in their distribution repositories.\r\n  - Simplify scenarios such as client-run testing of bug fixes and improvements. The build should work in an offline environment too for certain platforms.\r\n  - Enable the standard [down-/up-stream open-source model](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md).\r\n  - More efficient pipeline for security fixes during the CVE pre-disclosure process.\r\n\r\n## 📖 Further reading\r\n\r\nIn case you are interested in knowing more about the why's and how's of VMR's purpose, design and architecture, you may find the following set of documents interesting:\r\n  - [VMR's Design and Operation](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Design-And-Operation.md)\r\n  - [Upstream/Downstream Relationships](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md)\r\n  - [Code and Build Workflow](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Code-And-Build-Workflow.md)\r\n  - [Strategy for Managing External Source Dependencies](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Strategy-For-External-Source.md)\r\n\r\nThe build of the VMR is made possible by the [.NET Source-Build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build).\r\n\r\n## 💬 Discussion\r\n\r\nYou can share your thoughts on the VMR or see what others are saying at https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/11584\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/241","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\" (#241)"},{"Id":"1440663435","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-08T18:02:27","Actor":"dcwhittaker","Number":"240","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET November 2022 Updates","State":"open","Body":"Microsoft released the following [.NET Updates in November 2022](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/november-2022-updates/).\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Releases </h2>\r\n\r\n* [.NET 6.0.11 and .NET SDK 6.0.111](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.11/6.0.11.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0))\r\n* [.NET Core 3.1.31 and .NET SDK 3.1.425](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1.31/3.1.31.md)  ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1))\r\n\r\nThis issue will be updated if there are any additional releases during the month.\r\n\r\n## Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?\r\n\r\nYour app may be affected by many security vulnerabilities if you have not been installing .NET 6 patches. \r\n\r\n[Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/cve.md) makes it easy to tell how many CVEs affect your app, given the .NET 6 patch version you currently have deployed.\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Support Policies</h2>\r\nMicrosoft support policies are defined in the following documents:\r\n\r\n* [Currently Supported Releases](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md)\r\n* [Microsoft .NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/240","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET November 2022 Updates\" (#240)"},{"Id":"1440661312","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-08T18:01:14","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"239","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory  CVE 2022-41064 | .NET Information Disclosure Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory  CVE 2022-41064 | .NET Information Disclosure Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET, .NET Core and .NET Framework's System.Data.SqlClient and Microsoft.Data.SqlClient NuGet Packages.\r\n\r\nA vulnerability exists in System.Data.SqlClient and Microsoft.Data.SqlClient libraries where a timeout occurring under high load can cause incorrect data to be returned as the result of an asynchronously executed query.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/78042\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\r\n\r\nIf you are not talking to Microsoft SQL Server from your application you are not affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-packages\"></a>Affected packages\r\n\r\nPackage name | Vulnerable versions | Secure versions\r\n------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------\r\n[System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient/) | <=4.8.4 | 4.8.5\r\n[Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient/) | <= 1.1.3, 2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.1.0, 2.1.1 | 1.1.4, >=2.1.2\r\n\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n.NET has two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. Direct dependencies are dependencies where you specifically add a package to your project, transitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. \r\n\r\nFor example, the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc package depends on the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core package. When you add a dependency on Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc in your project, you're taking a transitive dependency on Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core. \r\n \r\nAny application that has a direct or transitive dependency on the  [affected packages](#affected-packages) listed above are vulnerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n* If you are using System.Data.SqlClient on .NET Framework you must install the November update for .NET Framework\r\n* If you are using System.Data.SqlClient on .NET Core, .NET 5 or .NET 6 you must update the nuget package to an updated version as listed in the [affected packages](#affected-packages).\r\n* If you are using Microsoft.Data.SqlClient, anywhere (.NET Core, .NET 5/6, .NET Framework) and you are using a version that is vulnerable you must update as listed in the [affected packages](#affected-packages).\r\n\r\nIf you don't know the difference between Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and System.Data.SqlClient please read the [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient initial announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-the-new-microsoftdatasqlclient/)  for an explanation,\r\n\r\n**Additional Details**\r\n\r\n.NET and .NET Framework projects have two types of dependencies: direct and transitive. You must update your projects using the following instructions to address both types of dependency. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, .NET Framework users must also install the November 2022 security patch to be protected. \r\n\r\n#### Direct dependencies \r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are discoverable by examining your csproj file. They can be fixed by editing the project file or using nuget command line to update the dependency. \r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies \r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. Transitive dependencies can be discovered by searching the project.assets.json file for each of your projects. This file is produced on each build and is in the obj directory for each project. \r\n\r\nThe project.assets.json files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### Fixing direct dependencies \r\n\r\nDirect dependencies are nuget packages that have been specifically added to a project, rather than being pulled in because a nuget package added requires it. They can be seen in the solution explorer in Visual Studio or by opening the csproj for the project and examining the packageReference nodes for the package name, specified by the Include parameter, and its version, specified by the Version parameter.  \r\n\r\nFor example, the following project file has a direct dependency on version 2.1.1 of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. \r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"2.1.1\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project> \r\n```\r\n#### Fixing direct dependencies with the nuget command line \r\n\r\nOpen a command line to the directory holding your project \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you are using a version of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient between 2.0.0 and 2.1.1 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient --version 2.1.2 \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you are using a version of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient below 1.1.4 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient --version 1.1.4 \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you are using a version of System.Data.SqlClient below 4.8.4 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package System.Data.SqlClient --version 4.8.5 \r\n\r\n#### Fixing direct dependencies by editing the project file \r\n\r\nOpen projectname.csproj in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose Edit projectname.csproj from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.  \r\n\r\nLook for PackageReference elements. The following shows an example project file: \r\n\r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"2.1.1\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project> \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference tone of the vulnerable packages as seen by the single PackageReference element. The name of the package is in the Include attribute. \r\nThe package version number is in the Version attribute. \r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed in the Affected software section of this document. \r\n\r\nIn this example, update Microsoft.Data.SqlClient to the appropriate fixed version for your major version. Save the csproj file. The example csproj now looks as follows: \r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"2.1.2\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated csproj file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version. \r\n\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the Output window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager. \r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the dotnet restore command to restore the updated dependencies. \r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a Dependency conflict warning, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package. \r\n\r\n#### Discovering and fixing transitive dependencies \r\n\r\nRebuild your solution and then open the project.assets.json file from in each of your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file. Both Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing. \r\n\r\nSearch the project.assets.json file for the vulnerable packages above using the format packagename/ for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search: \r\n\r\nExamine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the /. \r\n\r\nCompare to the vulnerable versions \r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows \"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\": \"2.1.0\" is a reference to version 2.1.0 of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient If your project.assets.json file includes vulnerable versions of the nuget packages then you need to fix the transitive dependencies. \r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either \r\n\r\nNone of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or \r\n\r\nYou have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies. \r\n\r\nIf your transitive dependency review found references to the vulnerable package, you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your csproj file to override the transitive dependency. \r\n\r\n#### Editing projects to fix transitive dependencies \r\n\r\nOpen projectname.csproj in your editor. Look for PackageReference nodes, for example: \r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"IndirectDependency\" Version=\"1.0.0\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project> \r\n```\r\n \r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated, matching major/minor version of the vulnerable by adding it to the csproj file. This is done by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version. For example,  \r\n```\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\"> \r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup> \r\n    <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework> \r\n    <Nullable>enable</Nullable> \r\n    <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings> \r\n  </PropertyGroup> \r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"IndirectDependency\" Version=\"1.0.0\" /> \r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"2.1.2\" /> \r\n  </ItemGroup> \r\n\r\n</Project> \r\n\r\n ```\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your csproj file. \r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated csproj file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions. You can see the restore results by opening the Output window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the Show output from drop-down list to Package Manager. \r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the dotnet restore command to restore the new dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### Using the nuget command line to fix transitive dependencies \r\n\r\nOpen a command window and change directory to your project directory.  \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you have an indirect dependency on Microsoft.Data.SqlClient between versions 2.0.0 and 2.1.1 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient --version 2.1.2 \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you have an indirect dependency on Microsoft.Data.SqlClient below 1.1.4 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package Microsoft.Data.SqlClient --version 1.1.4 \r\n\r\nRun the following command if you have an indirect dependency on System.Data.SqlClient below 4.8.4 \r\n\r\n> dotnet add package System.Data.SqlClient --version 4.8.5 \r\n\r\nExecute the dotnet restore command to restore the new dependencies. \r\n\r\n#### Rebuilding your application \r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy. \r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 6.0, please email details to [secure@microsoft.com](secure@microsoft.com).

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nThe [dotnet/announcements](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements) repo is intended to keep everyone informed about important information related to the .NET platform. It is a one-way broadcast that plays nicely with GitHub notifications, making it desirable to watch/subscribe to it.\r\n\r\nWe've come up with some best practice guidelines on how to use these announcements. Our approach to announcements enables some things to work well and requires a little extra care with others.\r\n\r\n## Design points\r\n\r\nAs a broad description, think of dotnet/announcements as an aggregated mirror of important issues and GitHub notifications as an RSS feed for it. The issues in this repo are NOT the canonical copy, but a mirror.\r\n\r\nThe key design points of dotnet/announcements:\r\n\r\n- Issues-only repo.\r\n- Only a few people can create issues.\r\n- Issues are mirrored copies of issues from other repos.\r\n- Issues are locked immediately.\r\n\r\nThese design points significantly reduce the scale of notifications from this repo, resulting in high signal to noise. It also avoid two sets of uncoordinated discussions. Discussions only occur on the canonical issue.\r\n\r\nNote: We (ab)use \"temporary interaction limits\" so that only a few people can post to the repo. It would be ideal if this model (one-way broadcast) was better supported and we could just pin arbitrary org issues to an read-only announcements repo. \r\n\r\n## Best practices\r\n\r\nThe following best practices are intended to result in best overall community experience.\r\n\r\n### Don't link to dotnet/announcements from GitHub\r\n\r\nGitHub includes [references to other issues or PRs](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7038#ref-issue-1224354673) that link to an issue or PR as part of the comment/activity history. It's an excellent feature that helps us understand who else cares about a given topic. We actively rely on it and sometimes [reach out to other projects to help them](https://github.com/google/or-tools/issues/3276#issuecomment-1118911927).\r\n\r\nThis feature doesn't work with locked issues (which makes sense). Please do not link -- from GitHub -- to the locked mirror issue on dotnet/announcements, but to the unlocked canonical issue. Your reference will be blocked by the lock. That's counter-productive.\r\n\r\nYou can see this dynamic playing out in the following matching/pair issues. The canonical issue has all the messy (and useful) activity and the locked dotnet/announcement issue is a clean replica.\r\n\r\n- [Canonical issue](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7428)\r\n- [dotnet/announcements mirror issue](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/218)\r\n\r\nYou'll see the same pattern with other [dotnet/announcement issues](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues).\r\n\r\n### Prefer linking to dotnet/announcements from the web\r\n\r\nThere is value in linking to dotnet/announcements from blogs and other sites (like StackOverflow, just not GitHub). The value is that more people might discover dotnet/announcements, subscribe to it, and be better informed about .NET platform news.\r\n\r\nFrom dotnet/announcements, users can quickly jump to a canonical issue should they want to. However, if you want to link directly to canonical issues, that's A-OK.\r\n\r\n### Create your own queries\r\n\r\nIt is easy to create your own queries of dotnet/announcement issues. The easiest way to do that is via [labels](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/labels).\r\n\r\nHere are some good ones:\r\n\r\n- [Docker](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/labels/Docker)\r\n- [Monthly-Update](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/labels/Monthly-Update)\r\n- [Breaking%20Change](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/labels/Breaking%20Change)\r\n\r\nLooks like we messed up when we created the breaking change label. Team, let's try to avoid labels with spaces in future. We could change it, but ...\r\n\r\nYou can also create slightly more complex queries:\r\n\r\n- [.NET 6.0 + Security](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ASecurity+label%3A%22.NET+6.0%22)\r\n- [.NET 6.0 + Monthly Update](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AMonthly-Update+label%3A%22.NET+6.0%22+)\r\n\r\nNote: This best practice creates query links to dotnet/announcements, which can be seen as violating the previous practice. The query links unavoidably target dotnet/announcements.\r\n\r\n### Subscribe to notifications\r\n\r\nSubscribe to notifications will help keep you up to date with .NET Platform news. To subscribe, click the \"Watch\" button.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"614\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/175190716-572b42db-494e-44c9-9a74-add258c234fa.png\">\r\n\r\nYou will want to select \"All Activity\".\r\n\r\n<img width=\"305\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2608468/175190922-19c15684-17e1-462c-9fc9-48cfd14cdfef.png\">\r\n\r\n## Bests practices for Microsoft folks\r\n\r\nMicrosoft folks should follow these practices when posting issues to dotnet/announcements\r\n\r\n### Direct reader to the canonical issue\r\n\r\nDirect readers to the canonical issue as an immediate call out, with following pattern:\r\n\r\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7556. See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/223\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/227\r\n\r\nThe canonical issue should not link to the dotnet/announcements mirror issue.\r\n\r\n### Consider creating the canonical issue as a discussion\r\n\r\nThe GitHub discussion feature is very good. For issues that are sure to spark feedback and/or benefit from more discussion, you should use a discussion issue.\r\n\r\nGood discussion example: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/discussions/71042\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/229","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"dotnet/announcements best practices\" (#229)"},{"Id":"1287906136","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-28T21:30:32","Actor":"terrajobst","Number":"228","RawContent":null,"Title":"`System.Drawing.Common` will only be supported on Windows","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/designs/pull/234. See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\n***Note:** This is a re-post of a design point we already discussed and shipped in .NET 6. I'm posting this here because (1) some people have tried to find it here and (2) some folks have never heard of it.*\r\n\r\nMoving forward, `System.Drawing.Windows` will only be supported on Windows. The library is marked as Windows-only (which results in build warnings when used from cross-platform code) and will throw by default when used from a non-Windows OS. For the time being, there is a runtime switch that enables users to still carry and use their own copy of `libgdiplus`. We intend to remove this functionality eventually as well.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nIn the .NET Core 2.x days we created the `Microsoft.Windows.Compatibility` package which exposes many Windows-only APIs so that more people can migrate to .NET Core. As part of this, we also ported `System.Drawing.Common`. This was mainly meant for .NET Core users that still target Windows, however since Mono already had a cross-platform implementation, we decided to bring that over. The cross-platform functionality is provided via the native library `libgdiplus`. Sadly, `libgdiplus` is a community supported library and at this point effectively unmaintained.\r\n\r\nWhile `libgdiplus` has helped a lot of customers expand to cross-platform it has also caused some headaches. `System.Drawing.Common` is very Windows driven as it is mostly a wrapper around GDI+ and is heavily coupled to Windows Forms, which keeps evolving and diverging from cross-platform graphics. This has caused some confusion over why some things don't work well on Unix or don't work at all.\r\n\r\nThe cross-platform implementation of `System.Drawing.Common` is mainly provided on the native side, via `libgdiplus`. It's effectively a re-implementation of the parts of Windows that `System.Drawing.Common` is depending on. As you can imagine, that makes `libgdiplus` a very non-trivial component. It's around 30k lines of pretty old C code, virtually untested, and lacks a lot of functionality. `libgdiplus` also has a lot of external dependencies for all the image processing and text rendering, such as `cairo`, `pango`, and other native libraries, which makes maintaining and shipping it even more challenging.\r\n\r\nSince `System.Drawing.Common` was really designed to be a thin wrapper over Windows technologies, its cross-platform implementation is a bit like a square peg in a round hole; it's subpar because it was only designed with Windows in mind.\r\n\r\nSince the inclusion of the Mono cross-platform implementation we spent lot of time redirecting issues to `libgdiplus` that never got fixed, or helping people install `libgdiplus` correctly (because it's not part of .NET Core proper). This is very different from other external dependencies we have taken, for example, `icu` or `openssl`, which are high-quality libraries, rather than poorly maintained re-implementation of Windows components. Thus, we have come to believe that it's not viable to get `libgdiplus` to the point where its feature set and quality is on par with the rest of the .NET stack.\r\n\r\nWe have noticed (such as from analysis of NuGet packages) that `System.Drawing.Common` is used on cross-platform mostly for image manipulation like QR code generators and text rendering. We haven't noticed heavy graphics usage as our cross-platform graphics support is very incomplete. For example, right now some components crash on macOS because the native APIs we use have been deprecated and are no longer included with recent macOS releases. We have never gotten a report about that crash; we discovered it ourselves while making `System.Drawing.Common` trim compatible.\r\n\r\nThe usages we see of `System.Drawing.Common` in non-Windows environments are typically well supported with `SkiaSharp` and `ImageSharp`.\r\n\r\nThus, we believe it is not worth investing in making `System.Drawing.Common` work on non-Windows platforms and instead propose we only keep evolving it in the context of Windows Forms and GDI+.\r\n\r\n## Design Approach\r\n\r\nFor more details on the design approach, see [this design document](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/pull/234/files?short_path=5a79205#diff-5a79205cd271d8ec2d3c5d74112f6874998e1e1aa7ee00900db727eef25561d8).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/228","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`System.Drawing.Common` will only be supported on Windows\" (#228)"},{"Id":"1284382326","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T00:31:43","Actor":"richlander","Number":"227","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist package support will end with .NET 6 ","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/71231. See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\n# Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist package support will end with .NET 6 \r\n \r\nThe [Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist) package has historically allowed us to fast-track EventSource API bug fixes out-of-band for .NET Framework 4.x. In recent years we continued to ship versions of this package concurrently with .NET Core releases, but the last time it was used to intentionally distribute out-of-band fixes for .NET Framework was package version 1.1.28 from 2015. The fixes that originally made the package useful have long since been applied to the .NET Framework in-box EventSource API and now we plan to phase out this package. Support for the current 6.0 version of the package will continue for as long as .NET 6.0 is supported but no future versions concurrent with .NET 7 and beyond are planned.\r\n \r\nWe recommend developers targeting .NET Framework 4.x use the in-box version of the EventSource API, System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource. Developers who want to track future feature development in the EventSource API should target System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource included in the latest available release of .NET runtime, currently .NET 6.\r\n \r\n## Details\r\n \r\n### How to migrate away from Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist\r\n \r\n1. For apps and libraries targeting .NET Framework ensure you are targeting at least version 4.6.2. For apps and libraries targeting\r\n .NET Standard, .NET Core, or .NET 5+ no targeting change is needed.\r\n \r\n2. Replace references in source to the namespace `Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing`\r\n with `System.Diagnostics.Tracing` instead. For example\r\n \r\n```\r\nusing Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing;\r\n```\r\nshould now be\r\n```\r\nusing System.Diagnostics.Tracing;\r\n```\r\n \r\n3. Remove package references to Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracking.EventSource.Redist from project files. You can do this in Visual Studio UI by selecting References->Manage NuGet packages... , then selecting the package from the installed package list and click the uninstall button. Alternately you can use the [Uninstall command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/ps-reference/ps-ref-uninstall-package) in Visual Studio package manager. For apps developed using the .NET CLI tools you can use the [dotnet remove package command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-remove-package).\r\n \r\n### What happens if I do nothing?\r\n \r\nThe Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist package should continue to work as-is, but support for the [latest major version of the package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource.Redist/6.0.0) will end November 12, 2024. After that point the package will receive no further fixes for security or any other reason.

This will include `go-live`, in addition to `sts`.\r\n- Add a new `release-type` property, with immutable values of `lts` or `sts`, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n## Timing\r\n\r\nThe change will be made in two phases:\r\n\r\n- The `release-type` property, and .NET 7 EOL date, will be added on July 13th via https://github.com/dotnet/core/pull/7499.\r\n- The `support-phase` property for .NET 7 will transition from `preview` to `go-live` on September 13th.

This new set of packages will be officially supported by the .NET team and conform to a consistent naming convention.\r\n\r\n## Removal of Existing Winget Packages\r\n\r\nA variety of .NET winget packages have been defined by the community. These are not consistently defined and do not conform to naming and versioning conventions used by the .NET product. These packages should be considered deprecated and will be removed and replaced by packages that are exclusively maintained by the .NET team.\r\n\r\nThe following packages are deprecated and will be removed:\r\n\r\n* [Microsoft.ASPNetCore.5-x64](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/manifests/m/Microsoft/ASPNetCore/5-x64)\r\n* [Microsoft.ASPNetCore.6-x64](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/manifests/m/Microsoft/ASPNetCore/6-x64)\r\n* [Microsoft.DotNetWorkload.Android](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/manifests/m/Microsoft/DotNetWorkload/Android)\r\n* [Microsoft.DotNetWorkload.Ios](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/manifests/m/Microsoft/DotNetWorkload/Ios)\r\n* [Microsoft.dotnet](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/manifests/m/Microsoft/dotnet)\r\n* [Microsoft.dotnetHostingBundle](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/manifests/m/Microsoft/dotnetHostingBundle)\r\n* [Microsoft.dotnetPreview](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/manifests/m/Microsoft/dotnetPreview)\r\n* [Microsoft.dotnetRuntime.3-x64](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/manifests/m/Microsoft/dotnetRuntime/3-x64)\r\n* [Microsoft.dotnetRuntime.3-x86](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/manifests/m/Microsoft/dotnetRuntime/3-x86)\r\n* [Microsoft.dotnetRuntime.5-arm64](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/manifests/m/Microsoft/dotnetRuntime/5-arm64)\r\n* [Microsoft.dotnetRuntime.5-x64](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/manifests/m/Microsoft/dotnetRuntime/5-x64)\r\n* [Microsoft.dotnetRuntime.5-x86](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/manifests/m/Microsoft/dotnetRuntime/5-x86)\r\n* [Microsoft.dotnetRuntime.6-x64](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/manifests/m/Microsoft/dotnetRuntime/6-x64)\r\n* [Microsoft.dotnetRuntime.6-x86](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/manifests/m/Microsoft/dotnetRuntime/6-x86)\r\n\r\n### Dependencies on Existing Packages\r\n\r\nThere are a set of packages that have dependencies on the above .NET packages to be removed. To avoid breaking these dependent packages, their dependencies will be updated to the new replacement packages before the deprecated ones are removed. \r\n\r\nThis is the set of packages which will have their dependencies updated:\r\n\r\n* [HandBrake.HandBrake](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/manifests/h/HandBrake/HandBrake)\r\n  * Current Dependencies:\r\n    * Microsoft.dotnetRuntime.5-x64\r\n    * Microsoft.dotnetRuntime.6-x64\r\n  * New Dependencies:\r\n    * Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.5\r\n    * Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.6\r\n* [Iriun.IriunWebcam](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/blob/master/manifests/i/Iriun/IriunWebcam)\r\n  * Current Dependencies:\r\n    * Microsoft.dotnetRuntime.3-x86\r\n  * New Dependencies:\r\n    * Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.3_1\r\n* [LINQPad.LINQPad.6](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/manifests/l/LINQPad/LINQPad/6)\r\n  * Current Dependencies:\r\n    * Microsoft.dotnetRuntime.3-x64\r\n  * New Dependencies:\r\n    * Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.3_1\r\n* [LINQPad.LINQPad.7](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/manifests/l/LINQPad/LINQPad/7)\r\n  * Current Dependencies:\r\n    * Microsoft.dotnetRuntime.6-x64\r\n    * Microsoft.dotnetRuntime.6-x86\r\n  * New Dependencies:\r\n    * Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.6\r\n* [Microsoft.PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/manifests/m/Microsoft/PowerToys)\r\n  * Current Dependencies:\r\n    * Microsoft.dotnetRuntime.3-x64\r\n  * New Dependencies:\r\n    * Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.3_1\r\n* [rocksdanister.LivelyWallpaper](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/manifests/r/rocksdanister/LivelyWallpaper)\r\n  * Current Dependencies:\r\n    * Microsoft.dotnetRuntime.3-x86\r\n  * New Dependencies:\r\n    * Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.3_1\r\n* [VMware.HorizonClient](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/manifests/v/VMware/HorizonClient)\r\n  * Current Dependencies:\r\n    * Microsoft.dotnetRuntime.5-x86\r\n  * New Dependencies:\r\n    * Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.5\r\n\r\n## New .NET packages \r\n\r\nThe .NET team will be replacing the previously mentioned community-maintained packages with a new set of packages with different package identifiers. These packages will be maintained by the .NET team and kept up to date as part of each servicing release for each of the supported .NET versions.\r\n\r\nThese are the package identifiers of the new set of packages to be added:\r\n\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.AspNetCore.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.DesktopRuntime.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.HostingBundle.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.Runtime.Preview\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.3_1\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.5\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.6\r\n* Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.Preview\r\n\r\n## Implementation Timeline\r\n\r\n1. Publish new .NET packages (Date: May 11, 2022)\r\n1. Create PRs to update dependencies to reference the new .NET packages instead of the deprecated ones (Date: May 11, 2022)\r\n1. Remove the deprecated .NET packages (Date: May 18, 2022)\r\n\r\n## Package Installation Instructions\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid compatibility issues, you must clean your machine of any existing .NET winget packages that are [listed for removal](#removal-of-existing-winget-packages) prior to installing the [new .NET packages](#new-net-packages).\r\n\r\nOnce you've installed the new .NET packages, upgrade will not work for those packages until a new [winget feature](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/issues/980) is available. To work around this issue, you'll need to force an upgrade to the  specific version that you want:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nwinget upgrade <package-id> --force --version <desired-version>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nYou can share your thoughts on this change or see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/7428","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/218","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Breaking Change to .NET Packages on Winget\" (#218)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Twitter":{"ResultType":"TwitterTimeline","Tweets":[{"Id":"1638673666878869504","CreatedAt":"2023-03-22T22:47:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"It's time to talk about accessibiliy.\n\nDrop in on a chat with @TheRachelKang and @PureWeek about all things… https://t.co/efKeiMuV9w","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod1.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publishing</a>","RetweetCount":9,"FavoriteCount":1,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1638625345648873472","CreatedAt":"2023-03-22T19:35:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"In today's #ASPNET Community Standup session replay, the team takes us through using Playwright to implement end-to… https://t.co/SuH6NbpVfl","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod1.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publishing</a>","RetweetCount":44,"FavoriteCount":8,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1638576020876926983","CreatedAt":"2023-03-22T16:19:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"There's a new WinForms Visual Basic Application Framework experience -- with countless new features and huge perfor… https://t.co/da1CvtnGud","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod1.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publishing</a>","RetweetCount":35,"FavoriteCount":6,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1638323859001622530","CreatedAt":"2023-03-21T23:37:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"👍 The #ASPNETMonsters are back on our radar. \n\n... and today they have a simple trick that makes it easy to debug a… https://t.co/8oHyv3mzEF","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod1.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publishing</a>","RetweetCount":24,"FavoriteCount":8,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1638277051407912967","CreatedAt":"2023-03-21T20:31:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":"Discriminated unions mean different things to folks with different programming backgrounds.\n\nOn today's Languages a… https://t.co/xgtXEGcfKK","Source":"<a href=\"https://prod1.sprinklr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sprinklr Publishing</a>","RetweetCount":42,"FavoriteCount":6,"RawContent":null},{"Id":"1638227473023356930","CreatedAt":"2023-03-21T17:14:01+00:00","UserScreenname":"dotnet","Text":".@JamesMontemagno and @praeclarum figured our how to run a Windows .exe on Windows with #dotNETMAUI.

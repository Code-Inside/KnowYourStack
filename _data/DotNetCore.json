The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

Currently, when a failure is encountered, we must open up and dig into a specific job, repro the issue, and find and sift through the logs or debug the tool. This process is time consuming and makes it hard to triage and act on issues.\r\n\r\nI propose that the Roslyn LSIF generator tool be updated to support the following 'standard error protocol' (note that the protocol could be written to a pipe or other output stream).\r\n\r\n# Protocol Spec\r\n\r\n- The stream is divided into lines. Each line, using \\r, \\r\\n, or \\n as a line separator, is treated as its own separate command.\r\n- Commands are parsed by taking a line in its entirety and parsing it with a standard JSON parser.\r\n- Empty lines are ignored.\r\n- Non-JSON lines are allowed but are re-dispatched as 'log' commands with 'error' severity.\r\n- 'Telemetry' can be passed with any command. This is a set of string key => { string or double } value properties that are Roslyn or language specific and may be aggregated for diagnostic purposes.\r\n- Each command follows the JSON schema:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"command\": \"log\",\r\n  \"parameters\": {\r\n    // One or more command specific parameters.\r\n  },\r\n  \"telemetry\": {\r\n    // Any arbitrary measurements or health metrics that should be reported.\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Log command\r\n\r\nInitially, `log` is the only supported command. Here is an example:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"command\": \"log\",\r\n  \"parameters\": {\r\n    \"severity\": \"Error\",\r\n    \"exception\": \"System.InvalidOperationException\",\r\n    \"callstack  \": \"at Foo.Bar() line 350...at Program.Main() line 15\",\r\n    \"code\": \"CS1501\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"telemetry\": {\r\n    \"Roslyn.LsifGenerator.IsDone\": false,\r\n    \"Roslyn.LsifGenerator.PercentageDone\": 50\r\n  }   \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLog supports the following parameters:\r\n\r\n- severity: This is case sensitive and can be \"Info\", \"Warning\", or \"Error\".\r\n- exception: This is a language specific exception or error code name.\r\n- code: This is a language or tool specific error code or failure name. This is used as a bucketing parameter for diagnosis and can be populated in whatever way makes sense for Roslyn.\r\n- callstack: This is the language specific call stack, stack trace, backtrace, or other diagnostic info.\r\n\r\nNote that no explicit limits are placed on length of each of these parameters, but the consumer may truncate them, if they exceed more than a few thousand characters.\r\n\r\n## Other commands\r\n\r\nCurrently none though this is left as an open-ended protocol in case we need a way to facilitate future LSIF tool => consumer communication for diagnostic purposes, like:\r\n\r\n- Reporting or triggering a fail fast.\r\n- Triggering collection of additional diagnostics or machine scoped configuration settings.\r\n- Measuring duration of operations.\r\n- Triggering ETW or dump collection, implemented by the consumer.\r\n\r\n# Roslyn specific implementation\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this work item is to enable automated aggregation of:\r\n\r\n- Any potential LSIF-generation-blocking failure.\r\n- Any exception or warning that may be indicative of a failure.\r\n- Performance metrics - _what part of generation takes the longest_\r\n- Diagnostic and verbose log output that may help with understanding major branches in generation logic that would enable one to better triage issues.\r\n\r\n## Cost Considerations for Logging\r\n\r\nMy goal is for this logging to be fairly verbose. Anything that might be of value in diagnosing and triaging failures should ideally be written using this logging mechanism and aggregation would happen in the consumer prior to transmission. e.g.: it should be ok to invoke log a few dozen or even a hundred times, so long as writing to STDERR is itself not a bottleneck.\r\n\r\n## Sample Metrics\r\n\r\nI'm looking for 'guard rails' that may indicate something went wrong at this stage. Here are some examples:\r\n- Documents count\r\n- Projects count\r\n- Documents with errors\r\n- Issues or diagnostics discovering and utilizing a particular version of .NET SDK, MSBuild, Nuget package, or tool.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/69610","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"LSIF generator should implement 'standard error protocol' and report exceptions, health, and performance metrics\" (#69610)"},{"Id":"1857137063","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-18T18:41:25","Actor":"jcouv","Number":"69609","RawContent":null,"Title":"Report misplaced unchecked in cref as warning","State":"open","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/69142","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/69609","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Report misplaced unchecked in cref as warning\" (#69609)"},{"Id":"1857026502","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-18T17:52:58","Actor":"sharwell","Number":"69606","RawContent":null,"Title":"VS Code extension does not provide CodeLens for fields","State":"closed","Body":"Prior extensions for VS Code based on OmniSharp did include CodeLens for fields.

In this case, I do not see a new certificate installed in Keychain Access, but I do still see the \"Installed an ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate.\" message in the output.\r\n\r\n### Exceptions (if any)\r\n<!-- \r\nInclude the exception you get when facing this issue\r\n-->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n- Include the output of `dotnet --info`\r\n```\r\n.NET SDK:\r\n Version:   7.0.400\r\n Commit:    73bf45718d\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Mac OS X\r\n OS Version:  13.4\r\n OS Platform: Darwin\r\n RID:         osx.13-arm64\r\n Base Path:   /Users/removed/.local/dotnet-sdk-7.0.400-osx-arm64/sdk/7.0.400/\r\n\r\nHost:\r\n  Version:      7.0.10\r\n  Architecture: arm64\r\n  Commit:       a6dbb800a4\r\n\r\n.NET SDKs installed:\r\n  7.0.400 [/Users/removed/.local/dotnet-sdk-7.0.400-osx-arm64/sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 7.0.10 [/Users/removed/.local/dotnet-sdk-7.0.400-osx-arm64/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 7.0.10 [/Users/removed/.local/dotnet-sdk-7.0.400-osx-arm64/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\nOther architectures found:\r\n  None\r\n\r\nEnvironment variables:\r\n  Not set\r\n\r\nglobal.json file:\r\n  Not found\r\n\r\nLearn more:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/info\r\n\r\nDownload .NET:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet/download\r\n```\r\n- The IDE (VS / VS Code/ VS4Mac) you're running on, and its version\r\nNot using an IDE at this time","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/34779","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"DOTNET_GENERATE_ASPNET_CERTIFICATE environment variable ignored in dotnet CLI first-time use flow\" (#34779)"},{"Id":"1857792244","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-20T02:30:03","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"34776","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/roslyn","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:03acf5d2-59bd-494b-c390-08d8e9750d9d)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn\r\n- **Subscription**: 03acf5d2-59bd-494b-c390-08d8e9750d9d\r\n- **Build**: 20230819.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: August 19, 2023 3:42:20 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 5fcefbef4fa8a28c2ac73c8c03ab37fca30e4570\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis**: [from 4.8.0-1.23418.6 to 4.8.0-1.23419.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp**: [from 4.8.0-1.23418.6 to 4.8.0-1.23419.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.CodeStyle**: [from 4.8.0-1.23418.6 to 4.8.0-1.23419.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Features**: [from 4.8.0-1.23418.6 to 4.8.0-1.23419.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Workspaces**: [from 4.8.0-1.23418.6 to 4.8.0-1.23419.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Workspaces.MSBuild**: [from 4.8.0-1.23418.6 to 4.8.0-1.23419.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.Net.Compilers.Toolset**: [from 4.8.0-1.23418.6 to 4.8.0-1.23419.1][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/compare/6652c3301b...5fcefbef4f\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:03acf5d2-59bd-494b-c390-08d8e9750d9d)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/34776","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/roslyn\" (#34776)"},{"Id":"1857823276","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-19T18:11:57","Actor":"Jestar342","Number":"34777","RawContent":null,"Title":"dotnet-watch has a dependency on ASP runtime, despite being a CLI-only tool.","State":"closed","Body":"<!--\r\nPlease keep in mind that the GitHub issue tracker is not intended as a general support forum, but for reporting **non-security** bugs and feature requests.\r\n\r\nIf you believe you have an issue that affects the SECURITY of the platform, please do NOT create an issue and instead email your issue details to secure@microsoft.com.

Windows Update periodically updates the installed version of the SDK on my machine to 7.0.203, presumably to address security vulnerabilities. However, when this update happens, it deletes `C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\7.0.200\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\Sdk\\Sdk.props` but _does not delete_ the containing directory `C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\7.0.200\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\Sdk`. This confuses MSBuild into thinking that the 7.0.200 SDK is still available, which breaks my build.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n1. Create a basic project with this global.json file:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"sdk\": {\r\n      \"version\": \"7.0.200\",\r\n      \"rollForward\": \"patch\",\r\n      \"allowPrerelease\": false\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\n# Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\nBuilding the .NET product from individual product repos in the [dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet) organization is a complex process requiring orchestration infrastructure that is available only to Microsoft. This is a hindrance to the .NET community as it's currently not possible to easily reproduce the official product build in the open. Furthermore, the complexity of the official build and release infrastructure tends to grow over the years. This presents many reliability and sustainability challenges.  \r\n\r\nTo address the abovementioned issues, **we'd like to announce a new repository** - https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet - which is the first step on the way to simplify building and shipping of .NET and making the product build process transparent to and reproducible by the community.\r\n\r\nThis new repository is a **Virtual Monolithic Repository (VMR)**. It includes all the code needed to build the .NET SDK, mirrored from the individual product repos (such as [dotnet/roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) or [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime)). It also includes [source-build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build), our whole-product build system used to build .NET by our Linux partners.\r\n\r\nThe VMR has the following main characteristics:\r\n- **Monolithic** - The repository is monolithic so that a single commit fully identifies the whole source code necessary to build the .NET SDK\r\n- **Virtual** - It's a mirror (not a replacement) of the individual product repos that make up the whole product, placed side-by-side in one repository. Changes to the underlying individual product repositories are synchronized to the VMR.\r\n- **Experimental** - Currently, the repository is part of our initiative to streamline the release process, not meant to be depended on. We reserve the right to delete the current instance and create a new, different one in its stead. We expect the repository to be persistent by the release of .NET 8 Preview 1, planned for February, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe repository is a work-in-progress and has a lot of [limitations](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet#limitations) but we believe that even with these limitations it can be already useful in a variety of scenarios.\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Goals of the Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\n- The main purpose of the [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet) repository is to have all source code necessary to build the .NET product available in one repository and identified by a single commit.\r\n- The VMR also aims to become the place from which we release and service future versions of .NET to reduce the complexity of the product construction process. This should allow our partners and and 3rd parties to easily build, test and modify .NET using their custom infrastructure as well as make the process available to the community.\r\n- Lastly, we hope to solve other problems that the current multi-repo setup brings:\r\n  -  Enable developers to make and test changes spanning multiple repositories.\r\n  -  Fulfill requirements of .NET distro builders such as RedHat or Canonical to natively include .NET in their distribution repositories.\r\n  - Simplify scenarios such as client-run testing of bug fixes and improvements. The build should work in an offline environment too for certain platforms.\r\n  - Enable the standard [down-/up-stream open-source model](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md).\r\n  - More efficient pipeline for security fixes during the CVE pre-disclosure process.\r\n\r\n## 📖 Further reading\r\n\r\nIn case you are interested in knowing more about the why's and how's of VMR's purpose, design and architecture, you may find the following set of documents interesting:\r\n  - [VMR's Design and Operation](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Design-And-Operation.md)\r\n  - [Upstream/Downstream Relationships](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md)\r\n  - [Code and Build Workflow](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Code-And-Build-Workflow.md)\r\n  - [Strategy for Managing External Source Dependencies](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Strategy-For-External-Source.md)\r\n\r\nThe build of the VMR is made possible by the [.NET Source-Build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build).\r\n\r\n## 💬 Discussion\r\n\r\nYou can share your thoughts on the VMR or see what others are saying at https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/11584\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/241","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\" (#241)"},{"Id":"1440663435","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-08T18:02:27","Actor":"dcwhittaker","Number":"240","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET November 2022 Updates","State":"open","Body":"Microsoft released the following [.NET Updates in November 2022](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/november-2022-updates/).\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Releases </h2>\r\n\r\n* [.NET 6.0.11 and .NET SDK 6.0.111](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.11/6.0.11.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0))\r\n* [.NET Core 3.1.31 and .NET SDK 3.1.425](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1.31/3.1.31.md)  ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1))\r\n\r\nThis issue will be updated if there are any additional releases during the month.\r\n\r\n## Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?\r\n\r\nYour app may be affected by many security vulnerabilities if you have not been installing .NET 6 patches. \r\n\r\n[Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/cve.md) makes it easy to tell how many CVEs affect your app, given the .NET 6 patch version you currently have deployed.\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Support Policies</h2>\r\nMicrosoft support policies are defined in the following documents:\r\n\r\n* [Currently Supported Releases](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md)\r\n* [Microsoft .NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/240","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET November 2022 Updates\" (#240)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2023-08-21T03:30:17.4682078Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":7068}

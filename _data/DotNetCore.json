It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help. Please let me know what I'm doing wrong or what else I can try.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1776","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF\" (#1776)"},{"Id":"702426498","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-16T06:07:11","Actor":"billvenhaus","Number":"1774","RawContent":null,"Title":"[UWP] HttpClientHandler - Digest Authentication Broken on Windows 10 PC","State":"closed","Body":"Just recently I found that my UWP app can no longer connect with Digest authentication on Windows 10 PCs.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption.

And the changes are identical to those in the other backports.\r\n\r\n# Regression\r\n\r\nThis is not a regression.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43141","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/2.1] Fix ReadOnlySequence created out of sliced Memory owned by MemoryManager\" (#43141)"},{"Id":"1224389900","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-03T19:24:35","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43143","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.26","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43143","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.26\" (#43143)"},{"Id":"1202264239","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-13T04:53:34","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43142","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merging internal commits for release/3.1","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43142","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Merging internal commits for release/3.1\" (#43142)"},{"Id":"1193653850","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-05T21:51:59","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"43140","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.25","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43140","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.25\" (#43140)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"},"Roslyn-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"1852079447","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-16T03:20:06","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"69530","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix reassigned-variable-underlining with primary constructors","State":"closed","Body":"We weren't marking the parameter reassigned if the assignment was in a different partial part.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/69530","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix reassigned-variable-underlining with primary constructors\" (#69530)"},{"Id":"1852407740","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-16T02:31:45","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"69534","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add formatting test for empty collection literal.","State":"open","Body":"First commit is test.

But after loading, the cursor is not at the referenced symbol, instead it's always at the beginning of the source file.\n3. Closing the tab and try again.

project with the content:\n\n```  \nusing a;\n#nullable enable\nclass C   {\n public void M() { string i = (string)\"\"; } }\n  \n```\n\nMake sure you have a Code Cleanup profile set to be used when saving that has the following fixers enabled:\n\n*   Remove unused variables,\n*   Remove unnecessary Imports or usings,\n*   Remove unnecessary casts,\n*   Remove unnecessary nullable directive,\n*   Format document.  \n    There might be more fixers that run on excluded files but there’s a lot of them, so I chose only these for the repro.\n\nNow exclude the file with the UI or by editing the .csproj - add `<Compile Remove=\"TheFile.cs\" />` to an `ItemGroup`, save the project file.  \nWhen you’ll save TheFile.cs, you’ll see that:\n\n*   the unused variable was not removed,\n*   **the using was removed**,\n*   the cast was not removed,\n*   the `#nullable` directive was not removed,\n*   **the document was formatted**.\n\nWhen modifying an excluded file (“Miscellaneous Files”) myself and saving I didn’t expect any fixer/formatter to be run afterwards, changing the file further in any way. I can’t avoid this without modifying settings or using a different file editing program. An excluded file doesn’t participate in the project and should be treated as if it didn’t contain anything to fix or modify, Code Cleanup shouldn’t be interested in the file. Also if you'll close a file and save in the confirmation popup, you may not even notice the non-source file was edited.\nRunning nothing automatically could be the intended behavior, I guess, because of the 3 example fixers that didn’t run but do run in on an included file.  \nThe option to _manually_ run Code Cleanup in any open file (with the button / Ctrl+K+E / selecting “Run Code Cleanup”) could be left available for anyone who would find it useful (but I’m indifferent about this).\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 8/14/2023, 08:51 PM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)\n\n---\n### Original Solutions\n(no solutions)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/69512","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"When saving, some Code Cleanup fixers modify C# source files excluded from compilation\" (#69512)"},{"Id":"1851351154","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-15T12:24:54","Actor":"jjonescz","Number":"69511","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unsplit `NullableWalker` after `out` argument","State":"open","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/67816.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/69511","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Unsplit `NullableWalker` after `out` argument\" (#69511)"},{"Id":"1851327464","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-08-15T12:06:14","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"69509","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:Coherency Updates)\r\n## Coherency Updates\r\n\r\nThe following updates ensure that dependencies with a *CoherentParentDependency*\r\nattribute were produced in a build used as input to the parent dependency's build.\r\nSee [Dependency Description Format](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/master/Documentation/DependencyDescriptionFormat.md#dependency-description-overview)\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Coherency Updates**:\r\n  -

Download the .NET SDK from https://aka.ms/dotnet/download [T:\\Temp\\workspace\\ConsoleApp99\\ConsoleApp99.csproj]\r\n\r\nBuild FAILED.\r\n\r\nC:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\7.0.400\\Sdks\\Microsoft.NET.Sdk\\targets\\Microsoft.NET.TargetFrameworkInference.targets(160,5): error NETSDK1045: The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET 8.0.  Either target .NET 7.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET 8.0. Download the .NET SDK from https://aka.ms/dotnet/download [T:\\Temp\\workspace\\ConsoleApp99\\ConsoleApp99.csproj]\r\n    0 Warning(s)\r\n    1 Error(s)\r\n\r\nTime Elapsed 00:00:00.44\r\n```\r\n\r\n**This error message is not the problem**. The problem is very strange SDK child process behavior when it started from under a unit test.\r\n\r\nCreate a unit test project:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ dotnet new xunit -o UnitTest1\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, edit `UnitTest1\\UnitTest1.cs` file\r\n```csharp\r\nnamespace UnitTest1;\r\nusing System.Diagnostics;\r\n\r\npublic class UnitTest1\r\n{\r\n    [Fact]\r\n    public void Test1()\r\n    {\r\n        const string consoleAppPath = @\"T:\\Temp\\workspace\\ConsoleApp99\";\r\n        const string consoleAppProjectFileName = @\"ConsoleApp99.csproj\";\r\n\r\n        var process = Process.Start(new ProcessStartInfo(\"dotnet\")\r\n        {\r\n            ArgumentList =\r\n            {\r\n                \"build\", \"--configuration\", \"Release\", Path.Combine(\r\n                    consoleAppPath, consoleAppProjectFileName)\r\n            },\r\n            WorkingDirectory = consoleAppPath,\r\n            RedirectStandardOutput = true,\r\n            RedirectStandardError = true,\r\n            RedirectStandardInput = true\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        Console.WriteLine(process.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(replace `T:\\Temp\\workspace\\ConsoleApp99` with the actual full path to `ConsoleApp99` directory on your computer)\r\n\r\nNow, let's run the test. Before running it, make sure there are no .NET build server processes (i.e. kill any `dotnet.exe` instances):\r\n```console\r\n$ cd UnitTest1\r\n$ dotnet build\r\n$ taskkill /IM dotnet.exe /F\r\n$ dotnet test\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see how `dotnet test` starts `testhost.exe`, and that starts `dotnet build` that the code asks:\r\n<img width=\"513\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/assets/92793/aa1c139b-701f-44fa-9f37-aadcf984b3eb\">\r\n\r\n`dotnet build` also spawns a child build server process (green on the screenshot above) with the following command line:\r\n```\r\n\"C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\dotnet.exe\" \"C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\7.0.400\\MSBuild.dll\" /nologo /nodemode:1 /nodeReuse:true /low:false\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut then, something strange happens: the initial `dotnet build` dies (probably because it finished the build), but the child process is still running.\r\n\r\nAnd then `process.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd()` never gets finished unless that process is killed.\r\n\r\n### Investigation\r\nSome details:\r\n1. I am unable to reproduce this in a console application. If I paste the same code into a console app, then it always works properly.\r\n2. I have a hypothesis. To me, it looks like `dotnet test` likely does _something_ to its child processes that makes `dotnet build` called from a test host to behave in a different way: perhaps it's an environment variable, or something strange done to the stdout handle of a test process, or maybe even [a Windows job object](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/job-objects) that spans over the child processes.\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ .NET SDK:\r\n Version:   7.0.400\r\n Commit:    73bf45718d\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\n# Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\nBuilding the .NET product from individual product repos in the [dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet) organization is a complex process requiring orchestration infrastructure that is available only to Microsoft. This is a hindrance to the .NET community as it's currently not possible to easily reproduce the official product build in the open. Furthermore, the complexity of the official build and release infrastructure tends to grow over the years. This presents many reliability and sustainability challenges.  \r\n\r\nTo address the abovementioned issues, **we'd like to announce a new repository** - https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet - which is the first step on the way to simplify building and shipping of .NET and making the product build process transparent to and reproducible by the community.\r\n\r\nThis new repository is a **Virtual Monolithic Repository (VMR)**. It includes all the code needed to build the .NET SDK, mirrored from the individual product repos (such as [dotnet/roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) or [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime)). It also includes [source-build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build), our whole-product build system used to build .NET by our Linux partners.\r\n\r\nThe VMR has the following main characteristics:\r\n- **Monolithic** - The repository is monolithic so that a single commit fully identifies the whole source code necessary to build the .NET SDK\r\n- **Virtual** - It's a mirror (not a replacement) of the individual product repos that make up the whole product, placed side-by-side in one repository. Changes to the underlying individual product repositories are synchronized to the VMR.\r\n- **Experimental** - Currently, the repository is part of our initiative to streamline the release process, not meant to be depended on. We reserve the right to delete the current instance and create a new, different one in its stead. We expect the repository to be persistent by the release of .NET 8 Preview 1, planned for February, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe repository is a work-in-progress and has a lot of [limitations](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet#limitations) but we believe that even with these limitations it can be already useful in a variety of scenarios.\r\n\r\n## 🎯 Goals of the Virtual Monolithic Repository\r\n\r\n- The main purpose of the [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet) repository is to have all source code necessary to build the .NET product available in one repository and identified by a single commit.\r\n- The VMR also aims to become the place from which we release and service future versions of .NET to reduce the complexity of the product construction process. This should allow our partners and and 3rd parties to easily build, test and modify .NET using their custom infrastructure as well as make the process available to the community.\r\n- Lastly, we hope to solve other problems that the current multi-repo setup brings:\r\n  -  Enable developers to make and test changes spanning multiple repositories.\r\n  -  Fulfill requirements of .NET distro builders such as RedHat or Canonical to natively include .NET in their distribution repositories.\r\n  - Simplify scenarios such as client-run testing of bug fixes and improvements. The build should work in an offline environment too for certain platforms.\r\n  - Enable the standard [down-/up-stream open-source model](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md).\r\n  - More efficient pipeline for security fixes during the CVE pre-disclosure process.\r\n\r\n## 📖 Further reading\r\n\r\nIn case you are interested in knowing more about the why's and how's of VMR's purpose, design and architecture, you may find the following set of documents interesting:\r\n  - [VMR's Design and Operation](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Design-And-Operation.md)\r\n  - [Upstream/Downstream Relationships](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Upstream-Downstream.md)\r\n  - [Code and Build Workflow](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Code-And-Build-Workflow.md)\r\n  - [Strategy for Managing External Source Dependencies](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/Documentation/UnifiedBuild/VMR-Strategy-For-External-Source.md)\r\n\r\nThe build of the VMR is made possible by the [.NET Source-Build](https://github.com/dotnet/source-build).\r\n\r\n## 💬 Discussion\r\n\r\nYou can share your thoughts on the VMR or see what others are saying at https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/issues/11584\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/241","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Announcing the .NET Virtual Monolithic Repository\" (#241)"},{"Id":"1440663435","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-08T18:02:27","Actor":"dcwhittaker","Number":"240","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET November 2022 Updates","State":"open","Body":"Microsoft released the following [.NET Updates in November 2022](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/november-2022-updates/).\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Releases </h2>\r\n\r\n* [.NET 6.0.11 and .NET SDK 6.0.111](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.11/6.0.11.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0))\r\n* [.NET Core 3.1.31 and .NET SDK 3.1.425](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1.31/3.1.31.md)  ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1))\r\n\r\nThis issue will be updated if there are any additional releases during the month.\r\n\r\n## Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?\r\n\r\nYour app may be affected by many security vulnerabilities if you have not been installing .NET 6 patches. \r\n\r\n[Which CVEs apply to my .NET 6 app?](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/cve.md) makes it easy to tell how many CVEs affect your app, given the .NET 6 patch version you currently have deployed.\r\n\r\n<h2>.NET Support Policies</h2>\r\nMicrosoft support policies are defined in the following documents:\r\n\r\n* [Currently Supported Releases](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md)\r\n* [Microsoft .NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/)\r\n* [.NET Core OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/240","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET November 2022 Updates\" (#240)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2023-08-16T03:30:17.2922079Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":7506}

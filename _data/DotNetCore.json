The change can have harmless non-test effects, for example a default interface method may be jitted redundantly fewer times after the change (as expected), since before the change the call to `GetNativeCode()` here would always return null for a default interface method and the method may be jitted again unnecessarily.\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/867aa5e1141c8801796a80171a3749d944c6b9af/src/vm/codeversion.cpp#L2304-L2309\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the main purpose of the port is to fix some GCStress tests to make CI runs more reliable and useful for testing other fixes made to 3.1.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n@echesakovMSFT has verified that all related GCStress failures are fixed after the change on Windows arm64 where the issues were seen.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow:\r\n- The change has been in all of the 5.0 releases\r\n- The change makes tracking of the native code for default interface methods similar to other methods that have a precode and don't have a stable entry point, so the behavior would be more consistent with other types of methods\r\n- The native code slot for default interface methods is a pointer-size extra memory per such method, it wouldn't be significant as the number of such methods is typically low compared to other types of methods, and most other methods already use a native code slot"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CLI":{"Events":[{"Id":"15570499212","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-17T02:42:46","Actor":"cristianosuzuki77","Repository":"dotnet/cli","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/13721","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Loc update\" (#13721) at dotnet/cli","RelatedBody":"Loc update.\r\nSome files are flagging BOM differences."},{"Id":"15570320563","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-03-17T02:17:08","Actor":"cristianosuzuki77","Repository":"dotnet/cli","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/cli/pull/13720","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"Loc update\" (#13720) at dotnet/cli","RelatedBody":"Updates to 2.1.5xx\r\nSeveral files are being flagged with BOM changes only.

default interface methods so that `MethodDesc::GetNativeCode()` can retrieve the current native code entry point (instead of returning null as before), and code versioning can find a matching code version from the code start address\r\n- Interface methods currently require having a precode, so the \"method entry point\" can't be used to directly store the native code entry point\r\n- Reenabled a couple of default interface method tests under GCStress\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/25690\r\n\r\n### Customer impact\r\n\r\nMostly only affects some GCStress tests. The change can have harmless non-test effects, for example a default interface method may be jitted redundantly fewer times after the change (as expected), since before the change the call to `GetNativeCode()` here would always return null for a default interface method and the method may be jitted again unnecessarily.\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/867aa5e1141c8801796a80171a3749d944c6b9af/src/vm/codeversion.cpp#L2304-L2309\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the main purpose of the port is to fix some GCStress tests to make CI runs more reliable and useful for testing other fixes made to 3.1.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n@echesakovMSFT has verified that all related GCStress failures are fixed after the change on Windows arm64 where the issues were seen.\r\n\r\n### Risk\r\n\r\nLow:\r\n- The change has been in all of the 5.0 releases\r\n- The change makes tracking of the native code for default interface methods similar to other methods that have a precode and don't have a stable entry point, so the behavior would be more consistent with other types of methods\r\n- The native code slot for default interface methods is a pointer-size extra memory per such method, it wouldn't be significant as the number of such methods is typically low compared to other types of methods, and most other methods already use a native code slot","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[3.1] Use native code slot for default interface methods (#25770)\" (#28153)"},{"Id":"807495713","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-10T12:31:00","Actor":"briansull","Number":"28146","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Backport the fix for dotnet/runtime issue 46529","State":"closed","Body":"5.0.x version of this change: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47741\r\n\r\n### Incorrect behavior a 64-bit long with shift of 32 or more combined with a cast to int \r\n\r\nThe JIT generates incorrect code for this code pattern:\r\n\r\n`(int) (X << C)`\r\n\r\nwhere C >= 32 and\r\nand  X is anything with a potential side-effect and is 64-bit integer type\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nReported by customer who was migrating to .Net Core from the Desktop runtime.\r\n\r\n## Regression?\r\n\r\nThis is a regression that was introduced in the .Net 3.X timeframe by \r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/19899\r\n\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\nFixes issue #47724","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28146","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Backport the fix for dotnet/runtime issue 46529\" (#28146)"},{"Id":"809951727","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-10T12:26:40","Actor":"davmason","Number":"28148","RawContent":null,"Title":"GCStress eventing fix","State":"closed","Body":"Port #26776 to 3.1. \r\n\r\nEventPipe had an issue where it would see a reentrant stackwalk during GCStress, which triggers asserts on checked or debug builds.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\nHaving tests fail under GCStress means we are less confident when preparing fixes for 3.1.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly \r\n                 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0\"\r\n\r\n2.

The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help.

Not sure if I'm using the wrong approach here, but more or less my workflow to investigate crashes in my source generators is this:\r\n\r\n- I notice that one of my generator isn't working (or see it log a diagnostic for an exception)\r\n- I add a `Debugger.Launch();` call at the first line of the `Execute` method in that source generator\r\n- I rebuild the source generator project\r\n- I rebuild the project using the source generator\r\n- VS shows the popup about an unhandled exception (ie. `Debugger.Launch();`)\r\n- I click \"Ok\" to debug it into VS, which switches to the debugger and breaks in the source generator\r\n- From there I happily go about actually investigating the exception\r\n\r\nNow, this is somewhat clunky but overall not the worst, and it works fine. The issue though is that since Roslyn just tries to run the generator all the time, once you add that line you basically start having VS open the popup \"an exception was thrown, launch a debugger?\" every 2 seconds, forever. You basically can't work anymore as that window keeps popping up constantly: you have to delete that line, rebuild the generator, clean the other project and then it stops. If you close VS and reopen it, that popup starts showing up every 2 seconds again unless you've also cleaned the solution (since the compiled generator references is cached by VS.\r\n\r\nThe main issue is that if you just try to add a breakpoint into your source generator, and then rebuild the project using it, that breakpoint will just never actually be hit, despite Roslyn running the shader just fine. Same for using the \"Exceptions Settings\" window, even if you check an exception to have VS break on it, that doesn't work for a source generator.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to just have breakpoints work from source generators? 😄\r\n\r\nAs in, so that if you set one and rebuild a project referencing the generator, the breakpoint would just be hit as expected. Then after that you could just remove it and go about your day. Since the generated assembly wouldn't be changed (no more `Debugger.Launch()` call), that isssue with VS just spamming those popups would go away as well.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/51962","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Better tooling support to debug source generators (breakpoints)\" (#51962)"},{"Id":"835105037","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-18T18:00:41","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"51961","RawContent":null,"Title":"Move code back from quick info to SymbolDisplay.","State":"open","Body":"This will help with https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/51846, removing unnecessary copying between xaml and Roslyn's QI providers.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/51961","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Move code back from quick info to SymbolDisplay.\" (#51961)"},{"Id":"834303022","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-18T17:46:24","Actor":"sharwell","Number":"51948","RawContent":null,"Title":"Only update snippet model on explicit selection","State":"closed","Body":"* Update snippet model on explicit selection only (breaks cycles that could occur)\r\n* Fix `FormatSpan` interfering with SignatureHelp\r\n* Add tests for previously-broken behaviors","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/51948","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Only update snippet model on explicit selection\" (#51948)"},{"Id":"834931775","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-18T15:17:10","Actor":"jhinder","Number":"51959","RawContent":null,"Title":"Very long expression crashes the IDE (stack overflow)","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: VS 16.10 Preview 1 (3.10.0-1.21125.6)\r\n\r\n**Steps to Reproduce**:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nconst long Y = unchecked(-+~long.MaxValue);\r\n```\r\n\r\nCopy and paste the `-+~` over and over again, until the IDE crashes.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior**:\r\nNo crash.

StaticField1;\r\n    public static int StaticField2;\r\n    public static float StaticField3;\r\n\r\n    [ThreadStatic]\r\n    public static int ThreadStaticField1;\r\n\r\n    static Class1()\r\n    {\r\n        StaticField1 = \"statically nice!\";\r\n        StaticField2 = 10;\r\n        StaticField3 = 3.56f;\r\n        ThreadStaticField1 = 56;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n.....\r\n\r\npublic static void DoFields()\r\n{\r\n    Class1 class1 = new Class1();\r\n    class1.Field1 = \"nice\";\r\n    class1.Field2 = 23;\r\n    class1.Field3 = 2.5f;\r\n\r\n    Console.WriteLine(class1.Field1);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(class1.Field2);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(class1.Field3);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic static void DoStaticFields()\r\n{\r\n    Console.WriteLine(Class1.StaticField1);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(String.Empty);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(Class1.StaticField2);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(Class1.StaticField3);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(Class1.ThreadStaticField1);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe interpreter will happily load instance and static fields on both dynamically loaded types and types compiled into the native executable, while ensuring that static constructors have been run in both cases.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corert/pull/8351","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[Interpreter]

the same directory is involved, but a different issue. From that ticket:\r\nWhen running a single exe packaged .Net Core app on Linux, it will first expand itself to a sub directory under /var/tmp/.net .\r\nIf /var/tmp/.net does not exist, the directory /var/tmp/.net is created. \r\n\r\nMy issue: My app is expanded into  a directory called /var/tmp/.net/EndotoxinDataRequest\\fhwc5bju.he1. This directory contains all the .NET libraries/dependencies. I run the app as a cron job, once/week. It will run fine for several weeks, then fail because it's missing a dependency. When it fails, if I go into that directory I can see that several of the libraries are missing. To make it run successfully, all I have to do is remove the directory. Then when I re-run the executible, it expands again, creates the directory and all the dependencies. It then runs successfully.\r\n\r\nWhy are the libraries disappearing? How can I prevent this? I've tried adjusting permissions and locking it down, but still...eventually, the app will fail because a dependency is missing.\r\n\r\nAny insight as to how to resolve this would be appreciated!

This announcement describes the process and what you need to do on your end.\r\n\r\n## Process\r\n\r\nWe'll start with a smaller list of repos and grow from there. Theses are the planned starting repos:\r\n\r\n* [dotnet/project-system](https://github.com/dotnet/project-system) ✔ \r\n* [dotnet/llvm-project](https://github.com/dotnet/llvm-project) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/icu](https://github.com/dotnet/icu) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/xharness](https://github.com/dotnet/xharness) ✔\r\n* [mono/linker](https://github.com/mono/linker) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/docker-tools](https://github.com/dotnet/docker-tools) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/wcf](https://github.com/dotnet/wcf) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/iot](https://github.com/dotnet/iot) ✔\r\n* [dotnet/winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms) ✔\r\n\r\nWe're starting with a smaller list to ensure we catch all cases where we need to update corresponding configuration in our Arcade-based tooling (see [this fantastic blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/) on how we build .NET).\r\n\r\nOnce we have validated our checklist, each repo admin will rename the default branch at their own pace. We expect to complete all repos in the next couple of months.\r\n\r\n## What you can expect\r\n\r\n*We have a detailed guide you can find at <https://aka.ms/m2m-dotnet>. This is only the essentials.*\r\n\r\nWe'll add a sticky issue to each repo when we're about to rename the branch. We'll do this a few days before and we'll leave it there for two weeks.\r\n\r\n**You don't need to update your PRs**. If you submitted a PR against the old default branch, the GitHub tooling will automatically retarget your PR against the new default branch (main).\r\n\r\nFor sanity, **you should rename the default branch in your fork as well**.

Intel is resolving the JCC erratum via a microcode update that has a potential performance side-effect.  The goal of this investigation was to determine whether or not we need to do any work in the runtime or framework to mitigate the impact of the microcode update.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the JCC erratum, or how applications can mitigate the performance impact, see https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/processors/mitigations-jump-conditional-code-erratum.pdf.\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who participated in discussions around the JCC erratum in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13794 and https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/13795.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nPlease share your thoughts on this change and see what others are saying at:\r\n - https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35730\r\n\r\n### The Bottom Line\r\nWhile we do see some impact from the JCC microcode update on our microbenchmark results on both Windows and Linux, we don’t see any negative impact on the “real world” scenarios that we A/B tested.  **As a result, we do not intend to implement any mitigations in the runtime or framework at this time.  Instead, our ask of you, is to help us identify your business-critical scenarios where you are seeing an unacceptable impact.**  We will use this data to inform future work in this space.\r\n\r\n### Comparison Setup\r\nIn order to do a clean comparison, we setup two identical machines each with an identical Skylake processor.  One machine was setup with a internal-only test build of Windows, and the other was setup with a publicly available build of Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).  Both were able to deploy and revert the microcode update (MCU).  This allowed for A/B comparisons and switching between the two versions of microcode on each machine.\r\n\r\n### Testing Strategy\r\nThe testing strategy was to run a selection of microbenchmarks and a set of larger scenarios across Windows and Linux, with the goal of understanding how impactful the JCC microcode update is to .NET Core.\r\n\r\n### Scenario Results\r\nThe scenarios used for this test are:\r\n - Linux: Cloud-scale app throughput - TechEmpower Plaintext and JSON\r\n - Windows: WPF app start-up - Real world app (Name withheld)\r\n - Windows: ASP.NET app start-up - [Link-A-Thon](https://github.com/rynowak/link-a-thon) (This is an ASP.NET Core app that has been used for many experiments recently)\r\n\r\n**Most scenario averages are within 1%, with the exception of TechEmpower JSON which improves with the microcode update by 2.45%.**\r\n\r\nNote: Negative percentages are regressions and positive percentages are improvements.\r\n\r\n#### TechEmpower Plaintext - Linux\r\n|       | Before       | After        | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|--------------|--------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 6,628,782.80 | 6,608,739.60 | -0.30%   |\r\n| Stdev | 10,334.67    | 40,146.37    |          |\r\n| Min   | 6,605,400.00 | 6,496,095.00 | -1.65%   |\r\n| Max   | 6,645,216.00 | 6,632,308.00 | -0.19%   |\r\n\r\n#### Techempower Json - Linux\r\n|       | Before     | After      | Diff (%) |\r\n|-------|------------|------------|----------|\r\n| Avg   | 568,352.00 | 582,285.40 | 2.45%    |\r\n| Stdev | 60,443.60  | 38,572.44  |          |\r\n| Min   | 437,075.00 | 513,170.00 | 17.41%   |\r\n| Max   | 667,430.00 | 631,945.00 | -5.32%   |\r\n\r\n#### WPF Real-World App Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before   | After    | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|----------|----------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 2740.761 | 2734.087 | -0.24%   |\r\n| Min | 2725.215 | 2696.806 | -1.04%   |\r\n| Max | 2773.128 | 2758.793 | -0.52%   |\r\n\r\n#### ASP.NET Core Link-A-Thon Startup - Windows\r\n|     | Before  | After   | Diff (%) |\r\n|-----|---------|---------|----------|\r\n| Avg | 340.604 | 338.521 | -0.61%   |\r\n| Min | 325.59  | 329.391 | 0.12%    |\r\n| Max | 375.822 | 346.351 | -7.84%   |\r\n\r\n### Microbenchmark Results\r\nThe microbenchmark suite contained 1673 benchmarks when run for this investigation.

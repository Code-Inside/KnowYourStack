It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal.

These ref assemblies only contain method declarations and no implementation details. Subsequent presses of F12 on a member within a ref assembly yield no further navigation.\n\nThis behavior occurs during normal development (not debugging) and hinders the ability to quickly inspect the underlying source code of .NET runtime components, which is crucial for understanding behavior and debugging.\n\nExpected Behavior\nPressing F12 on a .NET runtime member should:\n\nNavigate directly to the actual source code implementation of the member (e.g., the C# file on GitHub that Visual Studio downloads).\n\nIf the source code cannot be directly accessed, provide an informative message or fall back to a decompiled view, but not solely to the ref assembly without further navigation options.\n\nSteps to Reproduce\nOpen any .NET project (e.g., a Console Application targeting .NET 6, 7, or 8) in Visual Studio.\n\nIn a C# code file, type a common .NET runtime call, e.g., Console.WriteLine(\"Hello\");\n\nPlace the cursor on a .NET runtime member (e.g., WriteLine).\n\nPress F12 (Go To Definition).\n\nActual Result\nVisual Studio opens a tab displaying the member from a ref assembly (e.g., Console.cs [from metadata]), showing only the method signature and no implementation. Pressing F12 again on the method signature in this ref assembly tab does nothing.\n\nEnvironment\nVisual Studio Version: 17.14.8 Preview 10\n\n.NET SDK Version: 8.0\n\nOperating System: Windows Server 2022\n\nDebugger Options Configuration\n![image.png](https://aka.ms/dc/image?name=Bcc38e91d5ea840a69de7971377810049638880644456223320_20250714-123404-image.png&tid=cc38e91d5ea840a69de7971377810049638880644456223320)\n![image.png](https://aka.ms/dc/image?name=B9c8aca57cfa44334b410783f208c50cc638880644894911741_20250714-123449-image.png&tid=9c8aca57cfa44334b410783f208c50cc638880644894911741)\n\n\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 7/13/2025, 10:47 PM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

Virtual Project Generation\n- Modified `VirtualProjectBuildingCommand.WriteProjectFile()` to add `<FileBasedProgram>true</FileBasedProgram>` property to virtual projects generated for file-based programs\n- Maintained existing `<Features>$(Features);FileBasedProgram</Features>` behavior for backward compatibility\n\n### 2. Default Property Value\n- Added conditional default in `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.props`: `<FileBasedProgram Condition=\" '$(FileBasedProgram)' == '' \">false</FileBasedProgram>`\n- Ensures all projects using the .NET SDK have the property available with appropriate values\n\n### 3. Test Coverage\n- Added unit tests validating that virtual projects (file-based) get `FileBasedProgram=true`\n- Added unit tests confirming regular projects don't override the default value\n- Tests verify both the standalone property and backward compatibility with Features\n\n## Property Behavior\n\n| Application Type | FileBasedProgram Value | Example Command |\n|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n| File-based | `true` | `dotnet run Program.cs` |\n| Project-based | `false` | `dotnet run` (with .csproj) |\n\n## SDK Usage\n\nSDKs can now conditionally adjust their behavior:\n\n```xml\n<PropertyGroup Condition=\"'$(FileBasedProgram)' == 'true'\">\n  <!-- Special handling for file-based programs -->\n  <EnableOptimizedSingleFileMode>true</EnableOptimizedSingleFileMode>\n</PropertyGroup>\n\n<PropertyGroup Condition=\"'$(FileBasedProgram)' != 'true'\">\n  <!-- Standard handling for project-based programs -->\n  <EnableFullProjectFeatures>true</EnableFullProjectFeatures>\n</PropertyGroup>\n```\n\n## Backward Compatibility\n\n- Existing `Features` property behavior is unchanged\n- No breaking changes to current functionality\n- Property is conditionally set to avoid overriding user-specified values\n\nFixes #49846.\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

For example, `net8.0` targets for ASP.NET include all pruned packages from `net7.0` ASP.NET and adds some additional new packages.\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/af1585c81f3a1f9ea4607d11a4f09d99456df5f0/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/FrameworkPackages/FrameworkPackages.net8.0.cs#L28\n\nHowever, there are some packages that have been removed from the runtime packs. For example, `System.Security.Permissions` was included in the `net5.0` target of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` but was removed in `net6.0` and later.\n\nSince the list of packages to prune includes all previous versions, this means that `System.Security.Permissions` is being pruned from transitive packages incorrectly when newer runtime versions. In my case, targeting .NET 8 using the .NET 9 SDK to build, this was causing runtime failures to load assemblies.\n\n### To Reproduce\n\n```xml\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\n  <PropertyGroup>\n    <TargetFramework>net9.0</TargetFramework>\n\n    <RestoreEnablePackagePruning>true</RestoreEnablePackagePruning>\n  </PropertyGroup>\n\n  <ItemGroup>\n    <!-- \n      Reference a package that has a transitive dependency on System.Security.Permissions 4.5.0 and which\n      uses the types from the assembly at runtime. Unfortunately, I don't have a handy example because the\n      relevant package that caused it in our environment is a private 3rd party package from Telerik.\n    -->\n    <PackageReference Include=\"SomePackage\" Version=\"1.0.0\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\n</Project>\n```\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n\nThis is an example of a runtime exception caused by this scenario.\n\n```\nSystem.IO.FileNotFoundException: 'Could not load file or assembly 'System.Security.Permissions, Version=4.0.1.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51'. The system cannot find the file specified.'\n```\n\n### Further technical details\n\nI did find a workaround by adding this to my `Directory.Build.targets` file. However, there may be other assemblies affected as well, so this list is probably incomplete.\n\n```xml\n<Target Name=\"CollectPrunePackageReferences\">\n  <ItemGroup>\n    <PrunePackageReference Remove=\"System.Security.Permissions\" />\n  </ItemGroup>\n</Target>\n```\n\nYou can see that .NET 5 includes `System.Security.Permissions` here: https://nuget.info/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Ref/5.0.0\n\nAnd that .NET 6 (and later) doesn't: https://nuget.info/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App.Ref/6.0.0\n\nThis is where it's included in the SDK (and from which it bubbles up to newer frameworks: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/af1585c81f3a1f9ea4607d11a4f09d99456df5f0/src/Tasks/Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks/FrameworkPackages/FrameworkPackages.net5.0.cs#L169","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/49844","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Some packages are incorrectly pruned for Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\" (#49844)"},{"Id":"3240426854","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-17T17:54:07","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"49843","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/9.0.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/scenario-tests","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:2c00c595-7965-4766-ead0-08dcbc303060)\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/scenario-tests\n- **Subscription**: [2c00c595-7965-4766-ead0-08dcbc303060](https://maestro.dot.net/subscriptions?search=2c00c595-7965-4766-ead0-08dcbc303060)\n- **Build**: [20250717.1](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=2752295)\n- **Date Produced**: July 17, 2025 5:43:41 PM UTC\n- **Commit**: [69b4c477e9c37a14583e8852fdb60bc68325da74](https://github.com/dotnet/scenario-tests/commit/69b4c477e9c37a14583e8852fdb60bc68325da74)\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/9.0\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Updates**:\n  - From [9.0.0-preview.25326.1 to 9.0.0-preview.25367.1][1]\n    - Microsoft.SourceBuild.Intermediate.scenario-tests\n    - Microsoft.DotNet.ScenarioTests.SdkTemplateTests\n\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/scenario-tests/compare/270606f9f3...69b4c477e9\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\n\n\n[marker]: <> (End:2c00c595-7965-4766-ead0-08dcbc303060)\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/49843","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/9.0.1xx] Update dependencies from dotnet/scenario-tests\" (#49843)"},{"Id":"3239766711","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-17T14:15:54","Actor":"jjonescz","Number":"49841","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ensure all evaluation data are in binlogs from file-based apps","State":"open","Body":"Better fix than https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/49588.\r\nCurrently only restore evaluation data are in the binlogs, not build evaluation data - this PR fixes that.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/49841","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Ensure all evaluation data are in binlogs from file-based apps\" (#49841)"},{"Id":"3239692679","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-17T13:55:11","Actor":"philasmar","Number":"49840","RawContent":null,"Title":"Static Assets are now included when packing a Blazor Web App","State":"open","Body":"<!--\nPlease keep in mind that the GitHub issue tracker is not intended as a general support forum, but for reporting **non-security** bugs and feature requests.\n\nIf you believe you have an issue that affects the SECURITY of the platform, please do NOT create an issue and instead email your issue details to secure@microsoft.com.

This Blazor Web App is also a dotnet tool. When packing this tool, the files that Bootstrap and BlazorMonaco needed (which are in wwwroot) were not included in the resulting NuGet package. So when installing the tool, which spins up a Blazor Web App, the web app was broken because it was missing necessary files. \nIn order to fix this issue, we had to add the following snippet to the .csproj:\n```\n<ItemGroup Condition=\"$(Configuration) == 'Release'\">\n  <None Include=\"$(OutputPath)\\publish\\wwwroot\\\" Pack=\"true\" PackagePath=\"tools\\net8.0\\any\\wwwroot\" Visible=\"false\" />\n</ItemGroup>\n```\n\nAfter updating to the latest .NET 10 Preview 6, the static assets seemed to be included by default now which was causing the error:\n```\nroot/.dotnet/sdk/10.0.100-preview.6.25358.103/Sdks/NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack/build/NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack.targets(221,5): error NU5050: Attempted to pack multiple files into the same location(s). The following destinations were used multiple times: tools/net8.0/any/wwwroot/...\n```\nThe error makes sense because we are copying the files a second time in .NET 10 preview 6, where previously they were not included by default.\n\nIf we comment out the snippet:\n```\n<ItemGroup Condition=\"$(Configuration) == 'Release'\">\n  <None Include=\"$(OutputPath)\\publish\\wwwroot\\\" Pack=\"true\" PackagePath=\"tools\\net8.0\\any\\wwwroot\" Visible=\"false\" />\n</ItemGroup>\n```\nThen the issue goes away.\n\nThis change in behavior is breaking for us and we need to understand if this is an intended change or a bug.\nWe were not seeing the issue with Preview 5 or any other .NET version.\n\n### To Reproduce\nThis is the failed build run if you want to examine the error closely:\nhttps://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-dotnet/actions/runs/16303271832/job/46096405864?pr=2111\n\n1. Clone the repo https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-dotnet\n2. Make sure you have .NET 10 Preview 6 installed\n3. Run the following test: https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-dotnet/blob/master/Tools/LambdaTestTool-v2/tests/Amazon.Lambda.TestTool.UnitTests/PackagingTests.cs\n\nTo fix the issue, you can comment out: https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-dotnet/blob/73c37bbfc4fb1a06a6b236d076bc225212a7f3dd/Tools/LambdaTestTool-v2/src/Amazon.Lambda.TestTool/Amazon.Lambda.TestTool.csproj#L24\n\n### Exceptions (if any)\n```\nroot/.dotnet/sdk/10.0.100-preview.6.25358.103/Sdks/NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack/build/NuGet.Build.Tasks.Pack.targets(221,5): error NU5050: Attempted to pack multiple files into the same location(s).

See that thread for discussion.\n\nToday we are excited to announce that the .NET 10 Preview 4 build was produced from [dotnet/dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet), using a new build system and repo structure! This is a major milestone in our **Unified Build** project, resulting in major efficiencies for the official build and aligning Microsoft practices with those of community .NET builders.\n\n## What's changing?\n\nFrom .NET Core 1.0 through .NET 9, we have had essentially two build systems that have evolved separately. Microsoft's build, which utilizes many small repositories and a complex dependency management system to produce a product, and a largely bespoke build that meets the requirements of our Linux distro partner community. We arrived at that situation by circumstance not intent. The new system corrects those challenges and enables Microsoft and the community to share a build system derived from the source-build system that the community had been using.\n\n## Unified Build?\n\nThe Unified Build project has been working for years to move from producing the core .NET product (SDK and runtimes) via a complex distributed, multi-repository build to a simpler system which builds the product from a single monolithic repository. This shift also brings closer alignment between the way that Microsoft and our Linux distro partners build .NET, a huge win for maintainability.\n\nUnified Build drastically reduces build overhead by forcing \"coherency\" of components at all times and performing most of the building in a set of parallel jobs (like Linux-x64) we call \"verticals\". No need to flow dependency updates through a dozen+ repositories for days to get a shippable build. Instead, each \"vertical \" (e.g. Windows x64, MacOS arm64, etc.) is built in parallel, then stitched together at the end to form the shipping product. Even more exciting, Unified Build reaps these full-build wins _without_ compromising the development efficiency of smaller repos by allowing source diffs (no mucking about with submodules) to flow to and from this \"virtual\" monolithic repository. A developer can work in an isolated repository, where tools and validation are tailored to a specific product component, without the overall product build incurring the cost that distributed development has. Or they can make cross cutting changes in the VMR repository itself, vastly accelerating inter-repo development.\n\n## What's next?\n\nOver the coming months. We'll be refining code flow, optimizing the build, improving dev workflow, and generally working on Fit and Finish prior to shipping .NET 10.

See that issue for discussion.\n\n.NET binaries and installers have moved to a new domain -- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` -- backed by a new Content Delivery Network (CDN). You may need to make changes to adjust.\n\nTracking issue: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9674\n\n> .NET Team Status:\n> - azureedge.net scream tests are starting\n> - See: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9676\n\n>  \n> Recommended action:\n> - Read [Critical: .NET Install links are changing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/critical-dotnet-install-links-are-changing/) for an overview.\n> - Update `azureedge.net` references\n> - Update local copies of install script\n> - Update pinned references to [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n> - Validate that firewall rules are resilient to using new domains.\n> \n> Last update: 2025.01.23\n> Next update: 2025.02.04\n\n## Context\n\nSome .NET binaries and installers have been hosted on Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) domains that end in `.azureedge.net`. These domains were hosted by [edg.io](https://edg.io/), which has [ceased operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/edgio-retirement-faq) due to bankruptcy. We [migrated to a new CDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/migrate-cdn-to-front-door) and will be using new domains going forward. \n\nWe expect`azureedge.net` domains to cease by 5/31 (at latest).\n\n## .NET Team Remediation\n\nNew domains were created:\n\n- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` for signed official builds\n- `ci.dot.net` for unsigned builds\n\nTest links for new CDN:\n\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nTest links for old CDN:\n\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nThe following resources have been updated to use new domains.\n\n- [`releases-index.json`](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json)\n- [.NET install script](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/)\n- [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n- [CI short links](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/pull/15365)\n\nOther changes are in progress.\n\n## User Remediation\n\nPlease make the following replacements:\n\n- `dotnetcli.azureedge.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n- `dotnetbuilds.blob.core.windows.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n\nAll the new domains are path-compatible with old domains, as they share the same origin.\n\nPlease also make the following changes:\n\n- Update local copies of the install script\n- Update setup-dotnet Action references\n- Validate that firewall rules work with the new domains\n\n## Install script\n\nThe [.NET install script](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script) is used to install .NET from our CDN. We are changing CDNs (documented in a following section), which requires us to change the install script to use the new CDN.\n\nUpdated scripts:\n\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh`\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.ps1`\n\nNotes: \n\n- Users who have local copies of these scripts will need to update their copies.\n- Users who rely on the remote copy (at the URLs above) do not need to do anything other than validate no observed change in behavior (due to new domains and CDNs being used).\n\nTracking PRs:\n\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #554](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/554)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #555](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/555)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts/issues #558](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/issues/558)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #564](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/564)\n- [dotnet/docs #44052](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/44052)\n\n## Official builds\n\nOfficial builds and JSON files are hosted via a CDN, available for use by the install script and other installers.\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net\n\nNotes:\n\n- Official builds are tested and signed by Microsoft. A `microsoft.com` domain was chosen to reflect that.\n- We also [plan to stop using dowload.visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9675) for new content. That CDN will continue to function.\n- [Microsoft.Deployment.DotNet.Releases](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Deployment.DotNet.Releases) has been [updated](https://github.com/dotnet/deployment-tools/pull/423)\n\nYou can change from old to new domains by changing the domain section of the URL. The other parts of the URL do not need to change.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nA set of short links are available for official builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/dotnet-sdk-win-x64.zip\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-x64.tar.gz\n \nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- Currently forward to:  https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net.\n- Will be changed to forward to: https://build.dotnet.microsoft.com.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in mid January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/core #9683](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9683)\n\n## CI builds\n\nContinuous integration (CI) builds are hosted via a CDN, available via the install script and GitHub README files.\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net\n\nNote: CI builds include a mix of tested and untested builds, signed and unsigned builds.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n\nA set of short links are available for CI builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/daily/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/dotnet-runtime-win-x64.exe\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-arm.tar.gz\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/10.0.1xx/daily/dotnet-sdk-osx-arm64.pkg\n\nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- New builds now forward to: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old builds forward to:  https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in mid January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/core #9683](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9683)\n\nCI build pages use the CI short links.\n\nExample build pages:\n\n- [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/project/dogfooding.md#daily-builds-table)\n- [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/README.md#nightly-builds)\n- [dotnet/sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/documentation/package-table.md)\n\n## Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions\n\n- Major versions tags for [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570) have been updated. References to pinned versions will require updating to the most recent version.\n- We expect that GitHub Enterprise Server will be addressed in January.\n- Azure DevOps [`UseDotnetTask`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/use-dotnet-v2?view=azure-pipelines) will be updated in January\n- We do not yet have a date for updating [Azure DevOps Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/server/).\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/336","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Critical: .NET install domains and URLs are changing\" (#336)"},{"Id":"2653140062","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T19:35:17","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"335","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET November 2024 Updates","State":"open","Body":"# .NET November 2024 Updates\n\nToday, we are releasing .NET 9 , .NET 8.0.11, and .NET 6.0.36 updates.\n\n* https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9599 \n* [.NET 9.0 Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0)\n* [.NET 8.0.11 and .NET SDK 8.0.404](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/8.0/8.0.11/8.0.11.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0))\n* [.NET 6.0.36 and .NET SDK 6.0.427](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.36/6.0.36.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0))\n\nAlso announced at [.NET Updates in November 2024](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-and-dotnet-framework-november-2024-servicing-updates/).\n\nThis issue will be updated if there are any additional releases during the month.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/335","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET November 2024 Updates\" (#335)"},{"Id":"2653127024","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T19:27:36","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"334","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-43498 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-43498 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\n\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 9.0. This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\n\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to a .NET vulnerable webapp or loading a specially crafted file into a vulnerable application.\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nDiscussion for this issue can be found at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/109740\n\n## <a name=\"mitigation-factors\"></a>Mitigation factors\n\nApplications that do not use the NrbfDecoder component are not affected by this vulnerability. By default, .NET console apps and web apps do not reference this component.\n\n## <a name=\"affected-software\"></a>Affected software\n\n* Any .NET 9.0 application running on .NET 9.0.0.RC.2 or earlier.\n\n## <a name=\"affected-packages\"></a>Affected Packages\nThe vulnerability affects any Microsoft .NET Core project if it uses any of affected packages versions listed below\n\n### <a name=\".NET 9\"></a>.NET 9\nPackage name | Affected version | Patched version\n------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------\n[System.Formats.Nrbf](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Formats.Nrbf)               |  <9.0.0 | 9.0.0\n\n\n## Advisory FAQ\n\n### <a name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\n\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\n\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\n\n1. To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 9.0 . If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\n2. If your application references the vulnerable package, update the package reference to the patched version.\n\nNote: You may need to take both actions. Upgrading to 9.0 GA is not by itself sufficient to resolve the vulnerability, since you could still be pulling in the vulnerable package by reference.\n\n* If you have .NET 8.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\n\n```\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\n\n\n Version:   8.0.200\n Commit:    8473146e7d\n\nRuntime Environment:\n\n OS Name:     Windows\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\n OS Platform: Windows\n RID:         win10-x64\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\n\nHost (useful for support):\n\n  Version: 8.0.3\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\n\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\n\n  8.0.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\n\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\n\n  Microsoft.NetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\n\n\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\n```\n\n* If you're using .NET 9.0, you should download and install .NET 9.0  Runtime or .NET 9.0.100 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.12 latest Preview) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0.\n\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\n\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\n\n## Other Information\n\n### Reporting Security Issues\n\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 9.0 or .NET 8.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

See that issue for discussion.\n\nSome .NET binaries and installers are hosted on Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) domains that end in `.azureedge.net`. These domains are hosted by [edg.io](https://edg.io/), which will [soon cease operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/edgio-retirement-faq) due to bankruptcy. We are required to [migrate to a new CDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/migrate-cdn-to-front-door) and will be using new domains going forward. It is possible that `.azureedge.net` domains will have downtime.\n\n> Current status:\n> - `azureedge.net` CDN domains are functional\n> - New CDN domains are functional\n> - Updated install scripts that use new CDNs are available.\n>  \n> Recommended action:\n> - Switch `azureedge.net` references to new domains\n> - Consider switching to temporary install script URLs\n> \n> Last update: 2024.12.23\n> Next Update: 2024.12.26\n\nYou may need to adapt to these changes.\n\nThere is a chance that `azureedge.net` domains will cease being functional with downtime. We will do our best to avoid that. Moving your usage to the new CDN is the best path to avoiding that.\n\nOur plan is a work-in-progress and is expected to evolve.\n\n## Affected resources\n\nDomains affected:\n\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net\n- https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net\n\nURLs affected:\n\n- https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh\n- https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.ps1\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/ (various)\n\nNot affected:\n\n- https://dotnet.microsoft.com/\n- https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/\n\n\nThere are many users of these resources, for example:\n\n- https://github.com/search?q=dotnetcli.azureedge.net&type=code\n- https://github.com/search?q=dot.net%2Fv1%2Fdotnet-install&type=code\n\nEarlier today, we switched the two `azureedge.net` domains above to use [Azure Traffic Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview). We intended this change to be transparent to all users. These domains are currently sending 100% of traffic to our [edg.io](https://edg.io/) CDNs. In the near term, we intend to start sending some or all traffic to a different CDN, which may break users with convervative firewall rules.\n\n## Install script\n\nThe [.NET install script](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script) is used to install .NET from our CDN. We are changing CDNs (documented in a following section), which requires us to change the install script to use the new CDN.\n\nUpdated scripts:\n\n- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/install-scripts/6cbf2c9ff4615b468f39dfbd2e536e2f6fbe2f95/src/dotnet-install.ps1\n- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnet/install-scripts/6cbf2c9ff4615b468f39dfbd2e536e2f6fbe2f95/src/dotnet-install.sh\n\nNote: These scripts are for temporary usage and are unsigned (important for PowerShell users). We will update the install script at the official location at a later time.\n\nThe updated scripts prefer the new CDNs, while enabling fallback to the legacy `azureedge.net` domains. The legacy domains may be removed at a later point.\n\nTracking PRs:\n\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #554](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/554)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #555](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/555)\n- [dotnet/docs #44052](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/44052)\n\nNotes (for the install script):\n\n- The `-NoCdn` or `--no-cdn` argument can be used to bypass using the CDN, which may help some users.\n- The `-AzureFeed` or `--azure-feed` argument can be used to specify an alternate storage account or CDN.\n\n## Plan for domains\n\nThere are multiple domains, used for different purposes.\n\n### Official builds\n\nOfficial builds and JSON files are hosted via a CDN, available for use by the install script and other installers.\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net\n\nNote: Official builds are tested and signed by Microsoft. A `microsoft.com` domain was chosen to reflect that.\n\nYou can change from old to new domains by changing the domain section of the URL. The other parts of the URL do not need to change.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nA set of short links are available for official builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/dotnet-sdk-win-x64.zip\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-x64.tar.gz\n \nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- Currently forward to:  https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net.\n- Will be changed to forward to: https://build.dotnet.microsoft.com.\n\n### CI builds\n\nContinuous integration (CI) builds are hosted via a CDN, available via the install script and GitHub README files.\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net\n\nNote: CI builds include a mix of tested and untested builds, signed and unsigned builds.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n\nA set of short links are available for CI builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/daily/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/dotnet-runtime-win-x64.exe\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-arm.tar.gz\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/10.0.1xx/daily/dotnet-sdk-osx-arm64.pkg\n\nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- Currently forward to:  https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net.\n- Will be changed to forward to: https://ci.dot.net.\n\nCI build pages use the CI short links.\n\nExample build pages:\n\n- [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/project/dogfooding.md#daily-builds-table)\n- [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/README.md#nightly-builds)\n- [dotnet/sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/documentation/package-table.md)\n\n## Remaining changes\n\nThe following changes are planned:\n\n- Update azureedge.net domains traffic manager configuration to use one or more new CDNs\n- Publish official install scripts (at `https://dot.net/v1/` location).\n- Update `aka.ms/dotnet` short links to forward to new CDNs.\n\nThe following resources use URLs that will be updated to the new domains.\n\n- [dotnet/dotnet-docker](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/6125) Dockerfiles\n- [dotnet/core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9669) JSON files\n- [dotnet/templating](https://github.com/dotnet/templating/pull/8595) template data\n- [iis.net](https://www.iis.net/) is affected\n\n## Risks\n\nThere is a chance that the edgio CDN services will be terminated we, our partners, and our users have a chance to adapt to the proposed changes in a staged and safe manner. If that happens, we will change existing scripts and links to use the new URLs and CDN immediately. That approach would maintain service for the bulk of users but might break users with firewall rules.\n\nWe recommend that users adapt to these changes as quickly as possible.\n\nAzure DevOps and GitHub Actions installation tools are dependent on some of these resources. We are working directly with those teams to maintain continuity of service. They are moving to the new domains at best speed."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreCLR":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CLI":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Standard":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreFx":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"Roslyn":{"Events":[{"Id":"45259617727","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-01-04T16:07:27","Actor":"ToddGrun","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76610","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Reduce pooled array allocations in the SyntaxParser\" (#76610) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"These pooled array allocations are showing up in the roslyn editing speedometer test as 2.9% of allocations in the code analysis process.\r\n\r\nThe SyntaxParser has pools for holding the BlendedNode and SyntaxToken arrays it uses.

An important detail - the argument of `nameof` is a **method group**:\n\n1. `Type1.f` - fully qualified through its parent type Type1\n1. `Type3.f` - fully qualified through an alias Type3\n1. `f` - unqualified, imported into the scope by the `using static Type1` directive.\n\nInspecting the `INameOfOperation` yields different results for the third case as explained in great detail in the aforementioned issue.\n\n## Proposed API\n\nSeems like the only case that needs special attention is when the argument of the `nameof` operator is a method group. Hence the idea is to introduce something like `IMethodGroupReferenceOperation`:\n\n```csharp\nnamespace Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Operations\n{\n     public class IMethodGroupReferenceOperation\n     {\n         public INamedTypeSymbol Type { get; }\n         public string Name { get; }\n     }\n...\n}\n```\n"},{"Id":"45252545308","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-01-04T03:26:00","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76611","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Additional extract method cleanup.\" (#76611) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":""}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreRT":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"SDK":{"Events":[{"Id":"45257284513","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-01-04T12:25:03","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/45713","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[release/9.0.2xx] Update dependencies from nuget/nuget.client\" (#45713) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:a8a96eea-7948-4ef9-bb5a-debaa65eb629)\n## From https://github.com/nuget/nuget.client\n- **Subscription**: a8a96eea-7948-4ef9-bb5a-debaa65eb629\n- **Build**: 6.13.0.108\n- **Date Produced**: January 4, 2025 3:09:07 AM UTC\n- **Commit**: 89781a27ff255553766e4b9403ea7947072b4335\n- **Branch**: dev\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Updates**:\n  -

I started updating my JavaScript client validation code and ran into a problem with the RangeAttribute.\n\nThe new RangeAttribute now supports MinimumIsExclusive and MaximumIsExclusive parameters.\n\n[Range(1,10)] renders HTML attributes\ndata-val=\"true\" data-val-range=\"The field Test must be between 1 and 10.\" data-val-range-max=\"10\" data-val-range-min=\"1\" \n\n[Range(1,10,MinimumIsExclusive = true, MaximumIsExclusive = false)] renders HTML attributes\ndata-val=\"true\" data-val-range=\"The field Test must be between 1 exclusive and 10.\" data-val-range-max=\"10\" data-val-range-min=\"1\" \n\n[Range(1,10,MinimumIsExclusive = false, MaximumIsExclusive = true)] renders HTML attributes\ndata-val=\"true\" data-val-range=\"The field Test must be between 1 and 10 exclusive.\" data-val-range-max=\"10\" data-val-range-min=\"1\" \n\n[Range(1,10,MinimumIsExclusive = false, MaximumIsExclusive = true)] renders HTML attributes\ndata-val=\"true\" data-val-range=\"The field Test must be between 1 exclusive and 10 exclusive.\" data-val-range-max=\"10\" data-val-range-min=\"1\"\n\nNote the default error messages correctly reflects the intension. The actual server sider validation works as expected.\n\nHistorically for client validation one would retrieve a data attribute form an input element to do client validation with. A data attribute indicating the exclusive state of the minimum and/or maximum value(s) is absent in the generated HTML element. Except for the error message there is no other way one can determine the exclusive state of the value.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"741314211","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-18T22:43:51","Actor":"amitagrawalhyd","Number":"1779","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support with Universal Windows Platform","State":"closed","Body":".Net Standard 2.1 is not supporting Universal Windows Platform and when we see the following doc \"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard\" it is showing TBD, need your help on finalizing few things for our project, by when we can see support with UWP and which version of UWP will be supported.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key.

However, it sets the size of the pool to be only 2 items. As these arrays are only released once the parser is disposed, and there are potentially quite a few concurrent parses going on during solution load, there ends up being quite a few allocations of these arrays due to earlier allocations not yet being released to the pool.\r\n\r\nInstead, just switch these object pools to use the default for the array size.\r\n\r\nLocal testing for opening the Roslyn sln showed about 50K SyntaxParser objects constructed, and I was seeing the blended/token arrays allocated 3.5K/10.5K respectively.

An important detail - the argument of `nameof` is a **method group**:\n\n1. `Type1.f` - fully qualified through its parent type Type1\n1. `Type3.f` - fully qualified through an alias Type3\n1. `f` - unqualified, imported into the scope by the `using static Type1` directive.\n\nInspecting the `INameOfOperation` yields different results for the third case as explained in great detail in the aforementioned issue.\n\n## Proposed API\n\nSeems like the only case that needs special attention is when the argument of the `nameof` operator is a method group. Hence the idea is to introduce something like `IMethodGroupReferenceOperation`:\n\n```csharp\nnamespace Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Operations\n{\n     public class IMethodGroupReferenceOperation\n     {\n         public INamedTypeSymbol Type { get; }\n         public string Name { get; }\n     }\n...\n}\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/76620","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The semantic model should handle the `nameof` argument the same, regardless of the way it is expressed in the syntax tree, if the end semantics is the same.\" (#76620)"},{"Id":"2767927419","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-04T03:25:59","Actor":"CyrusNajmabadi","Number":"76611","RawContent":null,"Title":"Additional extract method cleanup.","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/76611","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Additional extract method cleanup.\" (#76611)"},{"Id":"2768393476","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-04T03:23:31","Actor":"phil-allen-msft","Number":"76619","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove deprecated variable groups from 16.11","State":"open","Body":"Cherry-pick from #70690.

Dependencies on constant values (`enum` or `const`)\n1. Dependencies through the `nameof` operator.\n\nThese dependencies cannot be identified by examining the binary code, because they are inlined by the compiler. On the other hand, the Roslyn semantic model does specify them and so by using it we can detect these compile time dependencies.\n\nThis repository demonstrates a bug in the semantic model, where it fails to provide the dependency information for one particular scenarion - `nameof` operator referencing a symbol imported into the scope with `using static`. It works fine for constant values imported into the scope, the defect seems to only exist when `nameof` is involved.\n\n# Demo\n```\nC:\\work\\RoslynSemanticModelNameOfBug [master ≡]> dotnet run\n--- Type1.cs ---\npublic class Type1\n{\n    public const int I = 1;\n    public static void f(){}\n}\n\n--- Type2.cs ---\nusing static Type1;\nusing Type3 = Type1;\npublic class Type2\n{\n    public static string X = nameof(f);\n    public static int Y = I;\n    public static string Z = nameof(Type1.f);\n    public static string T = nameof(Type3.f);\n}\n\nAssertNameOfDependency(\"Type2.cs\", \"nameof(Type1.f)\")\nAssertNameOfDependency(\"Type2.cs\", \"nameof(Type3.f)\")\nAssertConstValueDependency(\"Type2.cs\", \"Y\")\nAssertNameOfDependency(\"Type2.cs\", \"nameof(f)\")\nUnhandled exception.

The only difference is how the function identifier is specified:\n1. `Type1.f` - fully qualified through its parent type `Type1`\n1. `Type3.f` - fully qualified through an alias `Type3`\n1. `f` - unqualified, imported into the scope by the `using static Type1` directive.\n\nThe semantic model fails to provide the details of the dependency in the last case. However, it does not mean it fails to handle identifiers imported into the scope through `using static`. The code assigns the `Type1.I` constant value to `Type2.Y` and the semantic model has no problem to identify this dependency.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/76616","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The semantic model incorrectly processes a reference to a symbol imported into the namespace with using static, which is mentioned in the nameof operator.\" (#76616)"},{"Id":"2768087220","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-03T19:47:58","Actor":"ToddGrun","Number":"76613","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: Reduce allocations by adding more SyntaxList specializations","State":"open","Body":"Created as a draft PR to get speedometer allocation information to determine whether this is worth pursuing.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we specialize and cache SyntaxLists with up to 3 children.

If there is any confusion, that's poor type authoring.\n\nHowever, the compiler doesn't seem like it was updated to match this spec change. It continues to implement the behavior as specified in v4:\n\n```cs\n// ❌ CS1640 foreach statement cannot operate on variables of type 'MyCollection' because it implements multiple\n// instantiations of 'IEnumerable<T>'; try casting to a specific interface instantiation\nforeach (var x in new MyCollection())\n{\n}\n\nclass MyCollection : IEnumerable<string>, IEnumerable<object>\n{\n    IEnumerator IEnumerable.GetEnumerator() => throw new NotImplementedException();\n\n    IEnumerator<string> IEnumerable<string>.GetEnumerator() => throw new NotImplementedException();\n\n    IEnumerator<object> IEnumerable<object>.GetEnumerator() => throw new NotImplementedException();\n}\n```\n\nV5 spec, which allows the above example without compile errors, with an element type of `string`, which is identical to the [current spec](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/statements#1395-the-foreach-statement):\n\n> If among all the types `Tᵢ` for which there is an implicit conversion from `X` to `IEnumerable<Tᵢ>`, there is a unique type `T` such that `T` is not `dynamic` and for all the other `Tᵢ` there is an implicit conversion from `IEnumerable<T>` to `IEnumerable<Tᵢ>`, then the collection type is the interface `IEnumerable<T>`, the enumerator type is the interface `IEnumerator<T>`, and the iteration type is `T`.\n\nV4 spec ([PDF](https://ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-334_4th_edition_june_2006.pdf)), which the compiler still follows:\n\n> If there is exactly one type `T` such that there is an implicit conversion from `X` to the interface `System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<T>`, then the **_collection type_** is this interface, the **_enumerator type_** is the interface `System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerator<T>`, and the **_element type_** is `T`.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/76598","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Foreaching over collections with compatible `IEnumerable<T>` implementations is disallowed by the compiler\" (#76598)"},{"Id":"2766547373","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-02T19:41:04","Actor":"jnm2","Number":"76597","RawContent":null,"Title":"Nullability warning is missing on the lock statement","State":"open","Body":"**Version Used**: 17.13.0 Preview 2.1\n\nThere is no nullability warning for `lock (null) { }` or `lock (maybeNullExpr) { }`, even though a null at runtime throws ArgumentNullException.\n\n#### Expected\n\nA nullability warning such as:\n\n- [CS8604](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/nullable-warnings#possible-null-assigned-to-a-nonnullable-reference) -

The practical impact of this is that the _default-namespace_ for embedded resources is then incorrect and since GetManifestResourceStream is _case-sensitive_, applications can fail depending upon what casing was used when specifying `dotnet build` or `dotnet publish`\n\n### To Reproduce\n\nThe attached zip file contains a minimal example but the repro case is trivial...\n\n- create a simple console application whose name is a mixture of upper and lower case (e.g. MyApp)\n- Add an embedded resource (e.g. \"testData.txt\")\n- Use the following code for Program.cs\n```CSharp\nusing System.Reflection;\nvar embedded = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().GetManifestResourceNames();\nforeach(var m in embedded)\n    Console.WriteLine($\"embedded resource '{m}'\");\n```\n\nBuild the application with expected casing of the project file then all lower-case...\n\n\n```\n➜ rm -r -force bin ;rm -r -force obj; dotnet build .\\MyApp.csproj;.\\bin\\Debug\\net9.0\\myapp.exe\nRestore complete (0.2s)\nYou are using a preview version of .NET. See: https://aka.ms/dotnet-support-policy\n  MyApp succeeded (0.2s) → bin\\Debug\\net9.0\\MyApp.dll\n\nBuild succeeded in 0.7s\nembedded resource 'MyApp.testData.txt'\n\n➜ rm -r -force bin ;rm -r -force obj; dotnet build .\\myapp.csproj;.\\bin\\Debug\\net9.0\\myapp.exe\nRestore complete (0.2s)\nYou are using a preview version of .NET.

output - the resource path uses the casing specified in the build line.*\n\nSomewhat unexpectedly, `dotnet run` manages to use the correct casing...\n\n```\n➜ rm -r -force bin ;rm -r -force obj; dotnet run .\\myapp.csproj\nembedded resource 'MyApp.testData.txt'\n```\n\n\n\n[MyApp.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18301143/MyApp.zip)\n\n\n### Further technical details\n\n```\n.NET

.NET install domains and URLs are changing","State":"open","Body":"> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9671. See that issue for discussion.\n\nSome .NET binaries and installers are hosted on Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) domains that end in `.azureedge.net`. These domains are hosted by [edg.io](https://edg.io/), which will [soon cease operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/edgio-retirement-faq) due to bankruptcy. We are required to [migrate to a new CDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/migrate-cdn-to-front-door) and will be using new domains going forward. It is possible that `.azureedge.net` domains will have downtime or become permanently unavailable.\n\n> Current status:\n> - `azureedge.net` CDN domains are functional\n> - New CDN domains are functional\n> - CDN is expected to switch from AFD to Akamai in week of January 6th\n> - Install scripts have been updated\n> - dotnet-setup GitHub Action has been updated\n> -  Upcoming changes: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9674\n>  \n> Recommended action:\n> - Read [Critical: .NET Install links are changing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/critical-dotnet-install-links-are-changing/) for an overview.\n> - Switch `azureedge.net` references to new domains\n> - Update your local copies of the install script\n> - Update pinned references to [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n> - Validate that firewall rules are resilient to using Akamai and/or Azure Front Door CDNs.\n> \n> Last update: 2025.01.04\n> Next Update: 2025.01.06\n\nYou may need to adapt to these changes.\n\nWe expect `azureedge.net` domains to cease being functional in the first half of 2025. Moving your usage to the new CDN is the best path to avoiding service disruption.\n\nTest links for new CDN:\n\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/Sdk/LTS/latest.version\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nTest links for old CDN:\n\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Sdk/LTS/latest.version\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\n\nOur plan is a work-in-progress and is expected to evolve. We recommend that affected users make changes by the end of January.\n\n## Affected resources\n\nDomains affected:\n\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net\n- https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net\n\nURLs affected:\n\n- https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh\n- https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.ps1\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/ (various)\n\nNot affected:\n\n- https://dotnet.microsoft.com/\n- https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/\n\nThere are many users of these resources, for example:\n\n- https://github.com/search?q=dotnetcli.azureedge.net&type=code\n- https://github.com/search?q=dot.net%2Fv1%2Fdotnet-install&type=code\n\nOn December 23rd, we switched the two `azureedge.net` domains above to use [Azure Traffic Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview). After that change, those domains continued to send 100% of traffic to our [edg.io](https://edg.io/) CDNs. We expect to drop edgio traffic to zero on December 27th by sending all traffic to a different CDN. These changes could break users with conservative firewall rules.\n\nUsers should not consider `azureedge.net` to be a long-term usable domain. Please move to the new domains as soon as possible. It is likely that these domains will be retired in the first half on 2025. No other party will be able to use them. We are not able to control the timing of these events.\n\n## Install script\n\nThe [.NET install script](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script) is used to install .NET from our CDN. We are changing CDNs (documented in a following section), which requires us to change the install script to use the new CDN.\n\nUpdated scripts:\n\n- https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh\n- https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.ps1\n- https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/tree/main/src\n\nThe updated scripts prefer the new CDNs, while enabling fallback to the legacy `azureedge.net` domains. The legacy domains will be removed at a later point.\n\n- Users who have local copies of these scripts will need to update their copies.\n- Users who rely on the remote copy (at the URLs above) do not need to do anything other than validate no observed change in behavior (due to new domains and CDNs being used).\n\nTracking PRs:\n\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #554](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/554)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #555](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/555)\n- [dotnet/docs #44052](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/44052)\n\nNotes (for the install script):\n\n- The `-NoCdn` or `--no-cdn` argument can be used to bypass using the CDN, which may help some users.\n- The `-AzureFeed` or `--azure-feed` argument can be used to specify an alternate storage account or CDN.\n\n## Plan for domains\n\nThere are multiple domains, used for different purposes.\n\n### Official builds\n\nOfficial builds and JSON files are hosted via a CDN, available for use by the install script and other installers.\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net\n\nNote: Official builds are tested and signed by Microsoft. A `microsoft.com` domain was chosen to reflect that.\n\nYou can change from old to new domains by changing the domain section of the URL. The other parts of the URL do not need to change.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nA set of short links are available for official builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/dotnet-sdk-win-x64.zip\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-x64.tar.gz\n \nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- Currently forward to:  https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net.\n- Will be changed to forward to: https://build.dotnet.microsoft.com.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in early January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/arcade #15365](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/pull/15365)\n\n### CI builds\n\nContinuous integration (CI) builds are hosted via a CDN, available via the install script and GitHub README files.\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net\n\nNote: CI builds include a mix of tested and untested builds, signed and unsigned builds.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n\nA set of short links are available for CI builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/daily/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/dotnet-runtime-win-x64.exe\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-arm.tar.gz\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/10.0.1xx/daily/dotnet-sdk-osx-arm64.pkg\n\nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- Currently forward to:  https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net.\n- Will be changed to forward to: https://ci.dot.net.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in early January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/arcade #15365](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/pull/15365)\n\nCI build pages use the CI short links.\n\nExample build pages:\n\n- [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/project/dogfooding.md#daily-builds-table)\n- [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/README.md#nightly-builds)\n- [dotnet/sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/documentation/package-table.md)\n\n## Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions\n\n- Major versions tags for [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570) have been updated. References to pinned versions will require updating to the most recent version.\n- We expect that GitHub Enterprise Server will be addressed in January.\n- Azure DevOps [`UseDotnetTask`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/use-dotnet-v2?view=azure-pipelines) will be updated in January\n- We do not yet have a date for updating [Azure DevOps Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/server/).\n\n## Other changes\n\nThe following resources are also affected.\n\n- [dotnet/dotnet-docker](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-docker/pull/6125) Dockerfiles\n- [dotnet/core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9669) JSON files\n- [dotnet/templating](https://github.com/dotnet/templating/pull/8595) template data\n- [iis.net](https://www.iis.net/) is affected\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/336","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Critical: .NET install domains and URLs are changing\" (#336)"},{"Id":"2653140062","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T19:35:17","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"335","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET November 2024 Updates","State":"open","Body":"# .NET November 2024 Updates\n\nToday, we are releasing .NET 9 , .NET 8.0.11, and .NET 6.0.36 updates.\n\n* https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9599 \n* [.NET 9.0 Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0)\n* [.NET 8.0.11 and .NET SDK 8.0.404](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/8.0/8.0.11/8.0.11.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0))\n* [.NET 6.0.36 and .NET SDK 6.0.427](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.36/6.0.36.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0))\n\nAlso announced at [.NET Updates in November 2024](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-and-dotnet-framework-november-2024-servicing-updates/).\n\nThis issue will be updated if there are any additional releases during the month.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/335","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET November 2024 Updates\" (#335)"},{"Id":"2653127024","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T19:27:36","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"334","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-43498 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-43498 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\n\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 9.0.

See that issue for discussion.\n\nWe'll be reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3 and encourage ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to update to it. In this post I'll provide more background.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> This post only applies if you're using ASP.NET Core **on .NET Framework**. If you're using ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Core 2.x, it is [already out of support][netcore-support], and you should upgrade to a supported version such as .NET 8.\n\n### Background\n\nEarly versions of ASP.NET Core were provided for .NET Framework and .NET Core. Since 2021, [ASP.NET Core 2.1 is supported][aspnet21-support] only when running on .NET Framework. ASP.NET Core 2.2 has been out of support on all platforms since 2019.\n\nThis happened before we had a [predictable schedule and alternate releases of Standard Term Support (STS) and Long Term Support (LTS)][core-release-policies]. Many users upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2, not realizing that this reduced their support duration.\n\nAs a result, we now have users that are running on the unsupported version of ASP.NET Core 2.2 on .NET Framework.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support        |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | [Supported][aspnet21-support] |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019       |\n\n### How to stay supported\n\n* If you're on .NET Core, you should upgrade to .NET 8 and use ASP.NET Core 8\n* If you're on .NET Framework, you can either migrate to .NET 8 or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.3, which is the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1 (see below)\n\nSince ASP.NET Core 2.x for .NET Framework is just a set of packages, downgrading isn't that easy; there are well over one hundred packages and not all of them have 2.x version numbers. To make matters worse, there are NuGet packages out there that also upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2. Downgrading to ASP.NET Core 2.1 would mean that NuGet fails to restore these dependencies with errors.\n\nIn order to make this easier, we'll reship ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, thus facilitating this downgrade as a package upgrade.\n\nYou might wonder why we don't reship ASP.NET Core 2.2 as 2.3 instead. The answer is breaking changes. ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago, while ASP.NET Core 2.1 kept being supported. We feel it would be wrong to force ASP.NET Core 2.1 users to accommodate those breaking changes in order to stay supported.\n\nUsers on ASP.NET Core 2.2 are unsupported and won't receive any security updates. Our priority is to help those users to get onto a supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework.\n\nBy reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, we provide users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 an off ramp to the supported version via a regular NuGet upgrade. Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 will also be pulled forward to 2.3, but since it's the same code as 2.1, there are no breaking changes. Moving forward, all updates to ASP.NET Core 2.1 will be published as 2.3. However, if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.1, you don't need to move to 2.3 in order to get updates. If we find security issues with 2.1 packages, those will be marked as vulnerable and the recommended version will be versioned as 2.3. Except for the version number changes, that's how ASP.NET Core 2.1 works today, so there are no changes for you and you don't need to preemptively update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 to receive those warnings.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n>\n> Please note that if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.2, you will *not* be getting vulnerability warnings via NuGet because the product is out of support. There is no change here, this has been the case since ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago. Therefore, if you're on ASP.NET Core 2.2, we strongly recommend to update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 as soon as possible in order to receive security fixes again.\n\nWe understand that this can be confusing, but we believe it's the best compromise to help ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to get back onto a supported train.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support                          |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | Supported with ASP.NET Core 2.3                 |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019                         |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.3 | [Supported, same code as 2.1][aspnet21-support] |\n\n### Summary\n\nFor .NET Core, ASP.NET Core 2.x is and remains unsupported.\n\nThe following statements are specific for ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Framework:\n\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.1 is and remains supported**.\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.2 is and remains unsupported**.\n* **We're re-versioning ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3** to allow ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to move to a supported version.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 should update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. Since it's the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1, there are no breaking changes or feature additions. This operation won't require any code changes on your side. But it will make your life easier as all future updates will be versioned as 2.3.x, so you'll have a consistent set of versions.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. This will ensure you get off of the unsupported version and thus will get security fixes. You should expect breaking changes as you're effectively downgrading to the code from ASP.NET Core 2.1. If you can't live without the features being added in ASP.NET Core 2.2, you'll have to migrate to a supported .NET version with those features, such as .NET 8.\n* **This does not extend or reduce the support durations of any products, nor which versions of .NET are supported where**. It's purely a re-versioning of ASP.NET Core 2.1 in order to help the math in the package manager. The net effect of this change is that the last supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework is also the highest minor version (2.3).\n\n[aspnet21-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/aspnet/2.1-packages\n[netcore-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core\n[core-release-policies]: https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-policies.md\n\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/58598.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nThe `CopyWithPrivateKey` methods that combine a certificate with its associated private key fail on macOS 15 when using in-memory (ephemeral) keys.  This failure is most commonly seen when creating new certificates via `CertificateRequest.CreateSelfSigned` or when loading a certificate and key from a PEM file (or files) with `X509Certificate2.CreateFromPem`, which utilize the affected methods.\r\n\r\nCallers of these methods on macOS 15 (\"Sequoia\") will receive a `CryptographicException`, specifically `Interop+AppleCrypto+AppleCommonCryptoCryptographicException: The specified item is no longer valid. It may have been deleted from the keychain.`  The `dotnet dev-certs https` command relies on `CertificateRequest.CreateSelfSigned` and fails with this error.\r\n\r\nThis issue affects .NET 6, .NET 8, and .NET 9. The issue is addressed in the upcoming .NET 6.0.34, .NET 8.0.10, and 9.0.0-rc2 releases, scheduled for release in October 2024.\r\n\r\n## Root Cause\r\n\r\nmacOS 15 uses a different status code to indicate a key is not in a Keychain than prior versions do.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\nIf you have not already upgraded to macOS 15 from a prior version and use .NET, you are not impacted by this issue.  If you are planning to upgrade to macOS 15, the workaround is to upgrade to .NET 6.0.34. .NET 8.0.10, or .NET 9.0.0-rc2 (scheduled for October 2024) prior to upgrading to macOS 15.\r\n\r\nLoading a certificate and its associated private key from a PKCS#12/PFX are not affected.  If you are using an application that supports loading a certificate (and associated private key) by either PFX or PEM, converting your PEM contents to PFX - and updating configuration appropriately - may unblock you.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/324","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Certificate Issues on macOS 15 (\"Sequoia\")\" (#324)"},{"Id":"2517880984","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-10T21:26:30","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"323","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 9 RC 1","State":"open","Body":"# Announcement\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to announce the release of .NET 9 Release Candidate 1.\r\n\r\nThis release contains the following improvements:\r\n\r\n## **📚Libraries**\r\n\r\n* [WebSocket `Keep-Alive` Ping and Timeout APIs](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#websocket-keep-alive-ping-and-timeout)\r\n* [Add ZLib, Brotli compression options](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#add-zlib-and-brotli-compression-options)\r\n* [Add TarEntry.DataOffset](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#add-tarentrydataoffset)\r\n* [`HttpClientFactory` no longer logs header values by default](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#httpclientfactory-no-longer-logs-header-values-by-default)\r\n* [Out-of-proc Meter wildcard listening](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#Out-of-proc-Meter-wildcard-listening)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md)\r\n\r\n## **🛠️ SDK**\r\n\r\n* [Workload History](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/sdk.md#workload-history)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/sdk.md)\r\n\r\n## **🌐 ASP.NET Core**\r\n\r\n* [Improvements to SignalR distributed tracing](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#improvements-to-signalr-distributed-tracing)\r\n* [Keep-alive timeout for WebSockets](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#keep-alive-timeout-for-websockets)\r\n* [Keyed DI in middleware](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#keyed-di-in-middleware)\r\n* [Override `InputNumber` type attribute](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#override-inputnumber-type-attribute)\r\n* [Trust the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate on Linux](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#trust-the-aspnet-core-https-development-certificate-on-linux)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md)\r\n\r\n## **📱 .NET MAUI**\r\n\r\n* [Added `HorizontalTextAlignment.Justify`](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/dotnetmaui.md#added-horizontaltextalignmentjustify)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/dotnetmaui.md)\r\n\r\n## Get started\r\n\r\nTo get started with .NET 9, [install the .NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0).\r\n\r\nIf you're on Windows using Visual Studio, we recommend installing the latest [Visual Studio 2022 preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/). .NET 9 is now can be installed directly through the Visual Studio installer starting with Visual Studio 2022 17.12 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nYou can also use Visual Studio Code and the [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) extension with .NET 9.\r\n\r\nYou can find [.NET 9 RC 1 Installer & Binaries](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/9.0.0-rc.1.md) on GitHub.\r\n\r\n## Team Announcements & Discussions\r\n\r\nDiscuss this release with the product teams on GitHub through the announcements for this release.\r\n\r\n* [.NET MAUI](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/discussions/24698)\r\n* ASP.NET Core(https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/discussions/57787)\r\n\r\n## Stay up-to-date with .NET 9\r\n\r\nYou can stay up-to-date with all the features of .NET 9 with:\r\n\r\n* [What's new in .NET 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-9/overview)\r\n* [What's new in ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/release-notes/aspnetcore-9.0)\r\n* [What's new in .NET MAUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/whats-new/dotnet-9)\r\n* [What's new in EF Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew)\r\n* [Breaking Changes in .NET 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/compatibility/9.0)\r\n* [.NET 9 Releases](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/README.md)\r\n\r\nFor .NET 9 previews we are utilizing GitHub Discussions to make announcements.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nWe [announced Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-the-new-microsoftdatasqlclient/) in the first half of 2019 and [shipped the first stable](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-blog/released-general-availability-of-microsoft-data-sqlclient-1-0/ba-p/825859) package later that year. That release [coincided with .NET Core 3.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-0/#introducing-the-new-sqlclient). We’ve been developing [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient) in the [dotnet/SqlClient](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient) repo since that time, over the last five years. It’s now time to start the deprecation process for the [System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient) package. We plan to take a staged process to deprecation, with the intent to align support changes and associated code transition activities between these libraries to natural migration points between .NET major versions.\r\n\r\nAll System.Data.SqlClient users are encouraged to transition to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. We offer improvements and significantly higher support via the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nWe intend to deprecate the System.Data.SqlClient package in stages.\r\n- **Before .NET 9 GA:**\r\n  - Publish a new 5.0.0 package, including the following changes.\r\n  - Remove support for .NET 7 and earlier and .NET Framework 4.6.1 and earlier.\r\n  - Publish assets for the following target frameworks: .NET 8, .NET Framework 4.6.2, .NET Standard 2.0.\r\n  - Add [Obsolete attributes](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/attributes/general#obsolete-attribute) to .NET 8 and .NET Standard 2.0 assets. This will generate new warnings for .NET 8+ and .NET Standard users.\r\n  - Continue to offer security servicing, for .NET 8, and .NET Framework 4.6.2+ application users.\r\n- **After .NET 9 GA:**\r\n  - No change\r\n  - We will not support this package for .NET 9+ application users.\r\n- **After .NET 8 EOL:**\r\n  - Remove support for .NET 8 users (the .NET 8 library will be removed).\r\n  - Maintain support for .NET Framework 4.6.2+ users.\r\n  - Security servicing will be provided via .NET Framework, not the package, at that point.\r\n  - We do not expect to update the package again after this point.\r\n  - We will not mark the package as deprecated since it will only support .NET Framework users with an implementation provided by .NET Framework.\r\n\r\nWe will remove support in the package for unsupported .NET and .NET Framework versions at various stages of this deprecation plan. Users affected by those changes are encouraged to move to a supported .NET or .NET Framework version and to adopt the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package.\r\n\r\nWe decided to remove support for .NET 6 since it will go EOL shortly after this new package is released, even though .NET 6 will still be supported at the time. Publishing a .NET 8 library significantly simplifies the plan, both in terms of what we will deliver and what we need to explain.\r\n\r\nFor .NET dates, see [.NET Releases.](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md) .NET 9 will [GA in November](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md) of this year. .NET 8 will go EOL in November, 2026.\r\n\r\nThe current package version of [System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient) is 4.8.6, at the time of writing. These changes will be made with a 5.0.0 version and later.\r\n\r\n**Note:** _This deprecation doesn’t apply to the System.Data.SqlClient namespace in .NET Framework._\r\n\r\n### Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\r\n\r\nDaily downloads of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient on nuget.org are nearing 50% higher than System.Data.SqlClient. We expect the gap in usage between the two libraries will continue to increase. Microsoft.Data.SqlClient is the best library we offer to access SQL Server.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to providing high-quality, performance-driven, and secure data access technologies. We strongly encourage users to transition to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. It is actively maintained and supports the latest SQL Server features.\r\n\r\n### How to migrate? \r\n\r\nAdd the NuGet package to your project, then update your references and using statements. Our [porting cheat sheet](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/blob/master/porting-cheat-sheet.md) provides a step-by-step set of changes you may need to make.\r\n\r\n1. **Update your project references:** Replace references to System.Data.SqlClient with Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.\r\n2. **Modify your using statements:** Update your using statements in your code files from System.Data.SqlClient to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.\r\n3. **Test your application:** Thoroughly test your application to ensure that it works as expected after the migration.\r\n\r\nWe also plan to [support semi-automatic migration](https://github.com/dotnet/upgrade-assistant/issues/1593) via [.NET Upgrade Assistant](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/upgrade-assistant).\r\n\r\n**Support & Feedback:** If you have any questions or need assistance with the migration, please reach out through our [official support channels](https://support.microsoft.com/) or join the discussion on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues).\r\n\r\n**Resources**\r\n- [Frequently Asked Questions - dotnet/SqlClient Wiki - GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions)\r\n- [Introduction to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient namespace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/introduction-microsoft-data-sqlclient-namespace?view=sql-server-ver16)\r\n- [SQL Server and ADO.NET (Microsoft.Data.SqlClient)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/sql)\r\n- [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient API Browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/322","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Announcement: System.Data.SqlClient package is now deprecated\" (#322)"},{"Id":"2464032272","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-13T19:08:47","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"321","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 9 Preview 7","State":"open","Body":"We are pleased to announce the release of .NET 9 Preview 7.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nAs [announced earlier](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/293), starting with .NET 9, we no longer include an implementation of `BinaryFormatter` in the runtime (.NET Framework remains unchanged). The APIs are still present, but their implementation always throws an exception, regardless of project type. Hence, setting the existing backwards compatibility flag is no longer sufficient to use `BinaryFormatter`.\r\n\r\n* We published the [BinaryFormatter migration guide][migration-guide]. We'd appreciate if could give it a read and give us feedback by filling issues in the [dotnet/docs] repo.\r\n* If you experience issues related to BinaryFormatter's removal not addressed in this migration guide, please file an issue in the [dotnet/runtime][dotnet/runtime] repo and indicate that the issue is related to the removal of `BinaryFormatter`.\r\n\r\n### Why was it removed?\r\n\r\n*[Docs][security-guide]*\r\n\r\nThe primary reason is that BinaryFormatter is unsafe. Any deserializer, binary or text, that allows its input to carry information about the objects to be created is a security problem waiting to happen. There is a common weakness enumeration (CWE) that describes the issue: [CWE-502 \"Deserialization of Untrusted Data\"][CWE502]. `BinaryFormatter` is such a deserializer. We also cover this in the [BinaryFormatter security guide][security-guide].\r\n\r\n### What are my options to move forward?\r\n\r\n*[Docs][migration-guide]*\r\n\r\nYou have two options to address the removal of `BinaryFormatter`'s implementation:\r\n\r\n1. **Migrate away from BinaryFormatter**. We strongly recommend you to investigate options to stop using `BinaryFormatter` due to the associated security risks. The [BinaryFormatter migration guide][migration-guide] lists several options.\r\n\r\n2. **Keep using BinaryFormatter**. If you need to continue using `BinaryFormatter` in .NET 9, you need to depend on the unsupported [System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters][compat-pack] NuGet package, which restores the unsafe legacy functionality and replaces the throwing implementation.\r\n\r\n[compat-pack]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-migration-guide/compatibility-package\r\n[migration-guide]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-migration-guide/\r\n[security-guide]: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/serialization/binaryformatter-security-guide\r\n[CWE502]: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html\r\n[dotnet/docs]: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=01-general-issue.yml\r\n[dotnet/runtime]: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/new\r\n\r\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/106240.

name=\"how-affected\"></a>How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed, or an affected package listed in [affected software](#affected-packages) or [affected packages](#affected-software), you're exposed to the vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n* To fix the issue please install the latest version of .NET 8.0 or .NET 7.0 or .NET 6.0. If you have installed one or more .NET SDKs through Visual Studio, Visual Studio will prompt you to update Visual Studio, which will also update your .NET  SDKs.\r\n* If you have .NET 6.0 or greater installed, you can list the versions you have installed by running the `dotnet --info` command. You will see output like the following;\r\n\r\n```\r\n.NET Core SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n\r\n\r\n Version:   8.0.200\r\n Commit:    8473146e7d\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.18363\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\6.0.300\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n\r\n  Version: 8.0.3\r\n  Commit:  8473146e7d\r\n\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n\r\n  8.0.200 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n\r\n  Microsoft.AspAspNetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspAspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 8.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET Core runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```\r\n\r\n* If you're using .NET 8.0, you should download and install .NET 8.0.7  Runtime or .NET 8.0.107 SDK (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.8) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0.\r\n* If you're using .NET 6.0, you should download and install Runtime 6.0.32 or SDK 6.0.132 (for Visual Studio 2022 v17.4) from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0.\r\n\r\n.NET 6.0 and .NET 8.0 updates are also available from Microsoft Update. To access this either type \"Check for updates\" in your Windows search, or open Settings, choose Update & Security and then click Check for Updates.\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the updated runtime or SDK, restart your apps for the update to take effect.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if you've deployed [self-contained applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/deploying/#self-contained-deployments-scd) targeting any of the impacted versions, these applications are also vulnerable and must be recompiled and redeployed.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET 8.0 or .NET 6.0, please email details to secure@microsoft.com. Reports may qualify for the Microsoft .NET Core & .NET 5 Bounty.

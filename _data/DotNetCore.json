LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-1/) was shipped in May 30, 2018 and was declared an LTS release with the 2.1.3 update in August 2018. The 3-year lifecycle for the 2.1 release has come to an end on August 21, 2021.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.1 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.1 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported. This includes existing releases available on Linux package feeds. Previous versions, including 2.1, will be accessible through the [Download Archives](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/archives). \r\n\r\n## Policy Information\r\n\r\nAdditional lifecycle and

https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/find/features/RawStringLiterals\n\nUsually the most recent change to a file between the two branches is considered to have introduced the conflicts, but sometimes it will be necessary to look for the conflicting lines and check the blame in each branch. Generally the author whose change introduced the conflicts should pull down this PR, fix the conflicts locally, then push up a commit resolving the conflicts.\n\n### Resolve merge conflicts using your local repo\nSometimes merge conflicts may be present on GitHub but merging locally will work without conflicts. This is due to differences between the merge algorithm used in local git versus the one used by GitHub.\n``` bash\ngit fetch --all\ngit checkout -t upstream/merges/main-to-features/RawStringLiterals\ngit reset --hard upstream/features/RawStringLiterals\ngit merge upstream/main\n# Fix merge conflicts\ngit commit\ngit push upstream merges/main-to-features/RawStringLiterals --force\n```\n"},{"Id":"19056711783","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-11-25T21:08:51","Actor":"tiesmaster","Repository":"dotnet/roslyn","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/57992","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Change nullable annotation on CopyAnnotationsTo()\" (#57992) at dotnet/roslyn","RelatedBody":"Fixes #56949."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"CoreRT":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"SDK":{"Events":[{"Id":"19059113077","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-11-26T03:40:32","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/sdk","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22786","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/aspnetcore\" (#22786) at dotnet/sdk","RelatedBody":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:4491d9a4-839d-4af5-f3e4-08d8e97c775d)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore\r\n- **Subscription**: 4491d9a4-839d-4af5-f3e4-08d8e97c775d\r\n- **Build**: 20211125.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: November 26, 2021 3:15:06 AM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: d9660d157627af710b71c636fa8cb139616cadba\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

I have installed dotnet and adding the `System.Io.Ports` package on the host machine. When trying to run the project, I get an error saying that `System.Io.Ports` is only available on windows.

This can cause lock contention in high-traffic applications if multiple threads call these methods concurrently. We discovered this contention issue while investigating the contention issue described in https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28201.\r\n\r\nThis fix does not remove the lock outright, but it shrinks the window in which any given thread holds the lock. Previously, the logic was:\r\n\r\n1. Acquire the lock.\r\n2. Compute the key which will be used to query the dictionary. (Computing the key is string concatenation.)\r\n3. Query the dictionary.\r\n4. Release the lock.\r\n\r\nWith this change, the key is computed (2) _before_ the lock is taken (1). This means that the only operation which takes place within the lock is a dictionary lookup - not a string concatenation - and such lookups are expected to be very fast.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\nNo. This is a perf improvement compared to 3.1 RTM. Aside from the perf improvement, no behavioral changes should be observed.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nLow. This does not change the logical flow of this method, as all string components are already floating around within the method as locals. We're not introducing any new method calls (aside from the string allocation itself) outside the lock.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative is to port https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/26567 in its entirety. That PR fixes some race conditions in this code in addition to moving the string concatenation before the lock acquisition. That PR has been baking in the product since 5.0 RTM and we have not received any complaints about it, so it should be considered stable if we'd instead prefer to bring that along. However, it is larger than the absolute minimum necessary to solve the lock contention issue the customer is seeing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28202","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Reduce lock contentions in GetCultureInfoHelper\" (#28202)"},{"Id":"991644745","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-09-13T17:14:20","Actor":"GrabYourPitchforks","Number":"28201","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Port dotnet/runtime#40116 (MemberInfo lock contention) to 3.1","State":"closed","Body":"Ports the fix for https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/35851 from 5.0 to 3.1 per customer request.\r\n\r\n## Customer impact\r\n\r\nThe methods `Type.GetMethod` and `Type.GetField` take a per-Type lock while searching for the target member. This can cause lock contention in high-traffic applications if multiple threads call these methods concurrently on the same Type instance. We've received reports of customers' applications impacted by this contention and their RPS dropping precipitiously.\r\n\r\nThe fix avoids the lock entirely in the common case where all MemberInfo instances have already been cached. Multiple threads can walk this cache concurrently without contention.\r\n\r\n## Regression\r\n\r\nNo. This is a perf improvement compared to 3.1 RTM. Aside from the perf improvement, no behavioral changes should be observed.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nLow. This change originally went in to 5.0, and we've received no bug reports for these code paths since 5.0 RTM shipped. The code path also \"fails safe\", meaning that if the cache appears to be improperly initialized (perhaps because another thread is currently in the process of updating it) the method will fall back down the slower \"take the lock\" code path. This failsafe also shipped in 5.0 RTM.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28201","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Port dotnet/runtime#40116 (MemberInfo lock contention) to 3.1\" (#28201)"},{"Id":"991578402","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-09-09T16:29:45","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"28200","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:88e1281a-0536-412d-736c-08d72a4ce44a)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: 88e1281a-0536-412d-736c-08d72a4ce44a\r\n- **Build**: 20210827.4\r\n- **Date Produced**: 8/27/2021 5:44 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 98e2fbaad9f2f7bbe091bb0b9dd37d03206becc9\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/3.x\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk**: [from 1.0.0-beta.21376.2 to 1.0.0-beta.21427.4][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Feed**: [from 2.2.0-beta.21376.2 to 2.2.0-beta.21427.4][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Packaging**: [from 1.0.0-beta.21376.2 to 1.0.0-beta.21427.4][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Sdk**: [from 2.0.0-beta.21376.2 to 2.0.0-beta.21427.4][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/compare/c444d79...98e2fba\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:88e1281a-0536-412d-736c-08d72a4ce44a)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28200","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/3.1] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#28200)"},{"Id":"990171588","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-09-07T21:46:36","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"28198","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding for 3.1.20","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28198","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding for 3.1.20\" (#28198)"},{"Id":"990183431","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-09-07T20:55:11","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"28199","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding for 3.1.20","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28199","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding for 3.1.20\" (#28199)"},{"Id":"967801542","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-08-12T18:49:54","Actor":"crummel","Number":"28197","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merge internal 2.1.19 commits","State":"closed","Body":"@aik-jahoda @Anipik @vseanreesermsft @wtgodbe I thought this was merged with https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/28196 but it's missing the actual 2.1 commit.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4. It looks like there are patch releases; are there patch versions of a single .NET Standard version?\r\n5. Are there other repositories which are being used to create `netstandard.dll`?\r\n6. Is there a way to determine, from the repository, which commit is the one used for a given release?\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/standard/issues/1777","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Questions about tagging within this repository / future versions\" (#1777)"},{"Id":"722134943","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-10-16T08:15:08","Actor":"AksTheNerd","Number":"1776","RawContent":null,"Title":"Build issues when referencing project that targets multiple frameworks C# WPF","State":"closed","Body":"I'm working on converting a large WPF solution's projects to SDK style and ran into some issues.\r\n\r\nThe solution is large with multiple projects(old style) all targeting .net452 and some nugets(some made by me) installed, targeting both .net452 and .netstandard2.1 This all seems to work fine, somehow the nuget manages to install the correct version targeting .net452.\r\n\r\nI have decided to slowly convert the projects inside the solution to SDK style targeting .net452 and .netstandard2.1 just like the nugets.\r\n\r\nThis is where the problem starts, one project was converted so far that is referenced by multiple other projects. Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly \r\n                 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0\"\r\n\r\n2. It builds fine but on app launch it crashes with:\r\n\r\n                 \"Could not load file or assembly 'netstandard, Version=2.1.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51' \r\n                 or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.\"\r\n\r\nI'm suspecting that the problem is related to referencing the SDK project, it looks like that somehow it references the .netstandard2.1 instead of the .net452.\r\n\r\nThe reason this is my suspicion is that if targetframework is set to only .net452 on the referenced project everything works fine. Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists. At the moment I ran out of ideas and I'm here asking for help.

when a window update (WINDOW_UPDATE frame) is received at the same time as the HTTP/2 request is being completed.\r\nWe saw the very same problem in 5.0 in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/48220 (reported by customer) and fixed it in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47769 for .NET 5.0.\r\n\r\nThe problem lies in firstly locking connection sync object and then stream's (window update) while request completions attempts to lock stream and than connection.\r\n\r\nIn 5.0 (https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/47769), we've split `Http2Stream` lock into 2 objects, one for the stream itself (used for completion etc.) and other for credit handling (window updates and sent bytes counting).\r\nIn 3.1, `Http2Stream` looks slightly different and uses credit manager's sync object as stream's sync object. So redefining stream's sync object to lock over `this` achieves the same thing as the fix in 5.0 since operations over `Http2Stream` are guarded with stream's lock and operations with credit lock credit manager itself (separate sync object for window updates and sent bytes counting).\r\n\r\n### Customer Impact\r\n\r\nReliability problem.\r\nReported by customer using YARP.

But this is not coming from our call to AddSource, but from internal call in GeneratorDriver.\r\n\r\nThis is the callstack:\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft.CodeAnalysis.dll!Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.AdditionalSourcesCollection.Add(string hintName, Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Text.SourceText source) Line 63\tC#\r\nMicrosoft.CodeAnalysis.dll!Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.SourceOutputNode<System.__Canon>.AppendOutputs(Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.IncrementalExecutionContext context, System.Threading.CancellationToken cancellationToken) Line 100\tC#\r\nMicrosoft.CodeAnalysis.dll!Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.GeneratorDriver.UpdateOutputs(System.Collections.Immutable.ImmutableArray<Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.IIncrementalGeneratorOutputNode> outputNodes, Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.IncrementalGeneratorOutputKind outputKind, System.Threading.CancellationToken cancellationToken, Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.DriverStateTable.Builder driverStateBuilder) Line 277\tC#\r\nMicrosoft.CodeAnalysis.dll!Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.GeneratorDriver.RunGeneratorsCore(Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Compilation compilation, Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.DiagnosticBag diagnosticsBag, System.Threading.CancellationToken cancellationToken) Line 253\tC#\r\nMicrosoft.CodeAnalysis.dll!Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.GeneratorDriver.RunGenerators(Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Compilation compilation, System.Threading.CancellationToken cancellationToken) Line 45\tC#\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis happens even when the hintName we generate in CachedType3 has completely random string inside. So there should not exist 2 instances of CachedType3 having the same hintName, but it still happens.\r\n\r\nAnd since this happens outside of our call, the generator has no chance to catch this exception and handle it, so it'll always disable the generator.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, is there maybe a way how to handle this exception or how to re-enable/not disable the generator when this happens?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/57991","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Incremental source generator hint name issue\" (#57991)"},{"Id":"1063304217","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-25T08:44:55","Actor":"Varorbc","Number":"57990","RawContent":null,"Title":"why can't the source generator be used in the net6.0?

This is especially common in lower level code doing interop. For instance, consider this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nstatic unsafe void Test1()\r\n{\r\n    int x;\r\n    \r\n    Test2(&x);\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic unsafe void Test2(int* p)\r\n{\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe codegen for `Test1` is as follows:\r\n\r\n```asm\r\nldloca.s 0\r\nconv.u\r\ncall void '<Program>$'::'<<Main>$>g__Test2|0_1'(int32*)\r\nret\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut... According to ECMA then isn't that `conv.u` unnecessary given that `ldloca.s` here returns a transient pointer which is fine to pass directly where a raw pointer is expected? The memory location here is guaranteed not to be in a managed heap.\r\n\r\nSeems like a potential binary size optimization for managed assemblies, and could also possibly save time in the JIT's importer?\r\nOr, am I reading this wrong and there's a specific reason why `conv.u`-s are emitted in these cases?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/57970","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Roslyn emits unnecessary conv.u opcodes over transient pointers\" (#57970)"},{"Id":"1062446933","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-24T13:44:24","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"57969","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/dev17.0-vs-deps] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:059d41e3-5449-49d0-f30d-08d9a488296d)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: 059d41e3-5449-49d0-f30d-08d9a488296d\r\n- **Build**: 20211124.3\r\n- **Date Produced**: November 24, 2021 5:55:39 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 11fb2931671a47924e29b92e5fe06043fb3c6bbb\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk**: [from 7.0.0-beta.21569.2 to 7.0.0-beta.21574.3][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Sdk**: [from 7.0.0-beta.21569.2 to 7.0.0-beta.21574.3][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/compare/9746377...11fb293\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:059d41e3-5449-49d0-f30d-08d9a488296d)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/57969","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/dev17.0-vs-deps] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#57969)"},{"Id":"1062414122","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-24T13:12:49","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"57968","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:7e4fe80a-482b-4a41-5b66-08d8d8feb47e)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: 7e4fe80a-482b-4a41-5b66-08d8d8feb47e\r\n- **Build**: 20211124.3\r\n- **Date Produced**: November 24, 2021 5:55:39 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 11fb2931671a47924e29b92e5fe06043fb3c6bbb\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk**: [from 7.0.0-beta.21569.2 to 7.0.0-beta.21574.3][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Sdk**: [from 7.0.0-beta.21569.2 to 7.0.0-beta.21574.3][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/compare/9746377...11fb293\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:7e4fe80a-482b-4a41-5b66-08d8d8feb47e)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/pull/57968","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#57968)"},{"Id":"1062219919","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-24T09:58:36","Actor":"IrakliLomidze","Number":"57967","RawContent":null,"Title":"Folder based compilation in the .NET project ","State":"open","Body":"## Background and Motivation\r\n\r\nModifying large projects potentially cause issues. \r\ne.g. your code contains 50 folders with separate functionality, you tested it all.

I have installed dotnet and adding the `System.Io.Ports` package on the host machine. When trying to run the project, I get an error saying that `System.Io.Ports` is only available on windows.

When an application is compiled as self-contained and bundled into an MSI file, upgrading from a previous (e.g. .NET 5) version will lead to an issue in the Microsoft Installer installation process.\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n1. Create a new application (e.g. `dotnet new console -f net5.0`)\r\n2. Create `global.json` (e.g. `dotnet new globaljson --sdk-version 5.0.100`)\r\n3. Publish the app as self-contained application (e.g. `dotnet publish -c Release --self-contained true -r win-x64`)\r\n4. Bundle the application as MSI file (e.g. use WiX toolset or skip this step for now)\r\n5. Repeat steps 1 to 4 for .NET 6.0 (`-f net6.0` and `--sdk-version 6.0.100`)\r\n\r\n#### In case you created MSI files:\r\nInstall the MSI from the first run and then upgrade the installation using the MSI from the second run.\r\nInspect the installation directory: `Microsoft.VisualBasic.Core.dll` is missing.\r\nIf you repeat this but you do a fresh installation of the second run, `Microsoft.VisualBasic.Core.dll` would be correctly placed in the installation folder.\r\nIn the end this means upgrading or fresh installing will lead to different results.\r\n\r\n#### In case you did not build MSI files:\r\nInspect Publish-folder of both `dotnet publish`-runs. You will see that `Microsoft.VisualBasic.Core.dll` has a higher **file version** number for .NET 5 build than for the .NET 6 build.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43068830/143431351-74a970bf-d0e2-4b67-a277-19d59440a6f6.png)\r\n\r\n### Further technical details\r\nIt is important that the file version of a DLL does not downgrade for a newer installer compared to the currently installed DLLs.\r\nMore info about this can be found here:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/47157021/downgraded-ms-dll-disappears-on-upgrade-windows-installer\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/archive/blogs/astebner/why-windows-installer-removes-files-during-a-major-upgrade-if-they-go-backwards-in-version-numbers\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/both-files-have-a-version\r\n\r\n### Question\r\nWhat is the expected and recommended way to handle this problem?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/22773","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[BUG] Version downgrade in .NET 6 for Microsoft.VisualBasic.Core.dll leads to broken Microsoft Installers\" (#22773)"},{"Id":"1063060420","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-25T07:37:54","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"22766","RawContent":null,"Title":"[automated] Merge branch 'release/6.0.2xx' => 'main'","State":"closed","Body":"I detected changes in the release/6.0.2xx branch which have not been merged yet to main.

LTS releases are stable release which receive critical updates and are supported for at least three years. Current releases can include new features that may undergo future change based on feedback. Current releases are supported for three months after the subsequent .NET Core major or minor release. Both LTS and Current releases receive critical fixes throughout their lifecycle, for security, reliability, or to add support for new operating system versions. You must stay up-to-date with the latest patches to qualify for support. \r\n\r\n[.NET Core 2.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-2-1/) was shipped in May 30, 2018 and was declared an LTS release with the 2.1.3 update in August 2018. The 3-year lifecycle for the 2.1 release has come to an end on August 21, 2021.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core 2.1 Downloads\r\n\r\n.NET Core 2.1 installers, zips and tar.gzs will remain available, but unsupported.

They can be fixed by [editing the project file](#fixing-direct-dependencies) or using NuGet to update the dependency.\r\n\r\n#### Transitive dependencies\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies occur when you add a package to your project that in turn relies on another package. For example, if Contoso publishes a package `Contoso.Utility` which, in turn, depends on `Contoso.Internals` and you add the `Contoso.Utility` package to your project now your project has a direct dependency on `Contoso.Utility` and, because `Contoso.Utility` depends 'Contoso.Internals', your application gains a transitive dependency on the `Contoso.Internals` package.\r\n\r\nTransitive dependencies are reviewable in two ways:\r\n\r\n* In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, which supports searching.\r\n* By examining the `project.assets.json` file contained in the obj directory of your project for `csproj` based projects\r\n\r\nThe `project.assets.json` files are the authoritative list of all packages used by your project, containing both direct and transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to view transitive dependencies. You can either [use Visual Studio’s Solution Explorer](#vs-solution-explorer), or you can review [the `project.assets.json` file](#project-assets-json)).\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"vs-solution-explorer\"></a>Using Visual Studio Solution Explorer\r\n\r\nTo use Solution Explorer, open the project in Visual Studio, and then press Ctrl+; to activate the search in Solution Explorer. Search for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) and make a note of the version numbers of any results you find.\r\n\r\nFor example, search for `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` and update the package to the latest version\r\n\r\n\r\n##### <a name=\"project-assets-json\"></a> Manually reviewing project.assets.json\r\n\r\nOpen the *project.assets.json* file from your project’s obj directory in your editor. We suggest you use an editor that understands JSON and allows you to collapse and expand nodes to review this file.\r\nVisual Studio and Visual Studio Code provide JSON friendly editing.\r\n\r\nSearch the *project.assets.json* file for the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), using the format `packagename/` for each of the package names from the preceding table. If you find the assembly name in your search:\r\n\r\n* Examine the line on which they are found, the version number is after the `/`.\r\n* Compare to the [vulnerable versions table](#affected-software).\r\n\r\nFor example, a search result that shows `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer/2.1.0` is a reference to version 2.1.1 of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`.\r\n\r\nIf your *project.assets.json* file includes references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), then you need to fix the transitive dependencies.\r\n\r\nIf you have not found any reference to any vulnerable packages, this means either\r\n\r\n* None of your direct dependencies depend on any vulnerable packages, or\r\n* You have already fixed the problem by updating the direct dependencies.\r\n\r\n### <a name=\"how-fix\"></a>How do I fix the issue?\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"fixing-direct-dependencies\"></a>Fixing direct dependencies\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project. Look for `PackageReference` elements. The following shows an example project file:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\" Version=\"2.1.1 />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe preceding example has a reference to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), as seen by the single `PackageReference` element. The name of the package is in the `Include` attribute.\r\nThe package version number is in the `Version` attribute. The previous example shows a single direct dependency on `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` version 2.1.1\r\n\r\nTo update the version to the secure package, change the version number to the updated package version as listed on the table [previously](#affected-software).\r\nIn this example, update `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` to the appropriate [fixed package number](#affected-software) for your major version. Save the *csproj* file. The example *csproj* now looks as follows:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp2.1</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.App\" Version=\"2.1.30\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio and you save your updated *csproj* file, Visual Studio will restore the new package version.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nNow recompile your application. If after recompilation you see a *Dependency conflict warning*, you must update your other direct dependencies to versions that take a dependency on the updated package.\r\n\r\n#### <a name=\"transitive-dependencies\"></a>Fixing transitive dependencies\r\n\r\n* If your transitive dependency review found references to the [vulnerable package](#affected-software), you must add a direct dependency to the updated package to your *csproj* file to override the transitive dependency.\r\n\r\nOpen *projectname.csproj* in your editor. If you're using Visual Studio, right-click the project and choose **Edit projectname.csproj** from the context menu, where projectname is the name of your project.\r\nLook for `PackageReference` nodes, for example:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou must add a direct dependency to the updated version of the [vulnerable package](#affected-software) by adding it to the *csproj* file.\r\nYou do this by adding a new line to the dependencies section, referencing the fixed version.\r\nFor example, if your search showed a transitive reference to a vulnerable `Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices` version, you'd add a reference to the [fixed package number](#affected-software).\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>net461</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer\" Version=\"2.1.30\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"ThirdParty.NotUpdatedYet\" Version=\"2.0.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\n* We service .NET Core 2.1 incrementally. This means that users who reference the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI` package must add a reference to `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`.\r\n\r\n* The shared framework for .NET Core 3.1 and later does not include `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer.dll`. Users targeting netcoreapp3.1 or later must also update their `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` package version.\r\n\r\n* We service .NET Core 3.1 and later completely. This means users who reference `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI` or `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureADB2C.UI` can bump that version to 2.1.30. They don't need a new `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer` reference.\r\n\r\nAfter you've added the direct dependency reference, save your *csproj* file.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Visual Studio, save your updated *csproj* file and Visual Studio will restore the new package versions.\r\nYou can see the restore results by opening the **Output** window (Ctrl+Alt+O) and changing the **Show output from** drop-down list to **Package Manager**.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Visual Studio, open a command line and change to your project directory. Execute the `dotnet restore` command to restore the new dependencies.\r\n\r\n##### Rebuilding your application\r\n\r\nFinally, you must rebuild your application, test, and redeploy.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in .NET Core or .NET 5, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.

At the same time, continuing to build for all frameworks we ever shipped increases the complexity and size of a package. In the past, we've solved this issue by *harvesting*, which basically means:\r\n \r\n1. We build only for \"current\" frameworks\r\n2. During build, we download the earlier version of the package and \"harvest\" the binaries for earlier frameworks we no longer build for\r\n \r\nWhile this means that you can always update without worrying that we drop a framework it also means that you'll never get any bug fixes or new features if you consume a harvested binary. In other words, harvested assets can't be serviced which is now hidden because from your point of view you're able to keep updating the package to a later version even thought you're consuming the same old binary that we're no longer updating.\r\n \r\nFor .NET 6, we plan to no longer perform any form of harvesting to ensure that all assets we ship can be serviced. This means we're dropping anything older than:\r\n\r\n* .NET Framework 4.6.1\r\n* .NET Core 3.1\r\n* .NET Standard 2.0\r\n\r\nIf you're currently referencing an impacted package from an earlier framework, you'll no longer be able to update the referenced package to a later version. Your choice is to either retarget your project to a later version or not updating the referenced package (which is generally not a huge take back because you're already consuming a frozen binary anyways).\r\n \r\n## Affected packages\r\n\r\nThese packages no longer ship old frameworks:\r\n\r\n* `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyModel`\r\n* `Microsoft.Win32.Registry.AccessControl`\r\n* `Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents`\r\n* `System.ComponentModel.Annotations`\r\n* `System.ComponentModel.Composition`\r\n* `System.ComponentModel.Composition.Registration`\r\n* `System.Composition.AttributedModel`\r\n* `System.Composition.Convention`\r\n* `System.Composition.Hosting`\r\n* `System.Composition.Runtime`\r\n* `System.Composition.TypedParts`\r\n* `System.Data.Odbc`\r\n* `System.Diagnostics.DiagnosticSource`\r\n* `System.Diagnostics.EventLog`\r\n* `System.Diagnostics.PerformanceCounter`\r\n* `System.DirectoryServices`\r\n* `System.DirectoryServices.AccountManagement`\r\n* `System.DirectoryServices.Protocols`\r\n* `System.Drawing.Common`\r\n* `System.IO.Packaging`\r\n* `System.IO.Pipelines`\r\n* `System.Management`\r\n* `System.Net.Http.WinHttpHandler`\r\n* `System.Reflection.Context`\r\n* `System.Runtime.Caching`\r\n* `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.Cng`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.OpenSsl`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData`\r\n* `System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController`\r\n* `System.Speech`\r\n* `System.Text.Encoding.CodePages`\r\n* `System.Text.Encodings.Web`\r\n* `System.Threading.AccessControl`\r\n* `System.Threading.Channels`\r\n\r\nThese packages will no longer be updated because their implementation is now part of the .NET 6 platform:\r\n\r\n* `Microsoft.Win32.Registry`\r\n* `System.ComponentModel.Annotations`\r\n* `System.IO.FileSystem.AccessControl`\r\n* `System.IO.Pipes.AccessControl`\r\n* `System.Security.AccessControl`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.Cng`\r\n* `System.Security.Cryptography.OpenSsl`\r\n* `System.Security.Principal.Windows`\r\n\r\n## Timelines\r\n\r\nMany of these changes are shipping in .NET 6 Preview 5 while some will ship in .NET 6 Preview 6.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nFor a discussion, please comment in https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/54365.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/190","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Dropping older framework versions\" (#190)"},{"Id":"915260827","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-06-08T17:03:51","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"189","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-31957 | ASP.NET Denial of Service Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-31957 | ASP.NET Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 5.0 and .NET Core 3.1.

This shift is intended to make it easier for Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) customers to choose whether to allow .NET 6 and beyond on their environments, without the side effects a key shared between multiple products might have.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nToday Microsoft signs .NET artifacts with a variety of certificates. For example, NuGet packages, 3rd party binaries redistributed with .NET, Visual Studio extension packages, and some specialized debugging related binaries all have different certificates. The most common certificate is **Microsoft Corporation**, with issuer **Microsoft Code Signing PCA 2011** and thumbprint **abdca79af9dd48a0ea702ad45260b3c03093fb4b**, used to sign most executable files. .NET is switching to **.NET**, with issuer **Microsoft Code Signing PCA 2011** and thumbprint **60ff375e5669b98d43ea0e2328e618cf73c0f91d**.\r\n\r\nNot all binaries signed with **Microsoft Corporation** are shifting to the new certificate. .NET repackages a variety of assets from previous releases (e.g. targeting packs), and those will not change. Only newly built .NET 6 binaries will get the new certificate. Some tooling utilized in Visual Studio will remain on the existing cert.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nQuestions or concerns?

When you go to your fork, GitHub will guide you through this experience:\r\n\r\n![Rename branch in fork](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5169960/105210186-92bdba80-5aff-11eb-99c9-0beb708fcf3f.png)\r\n\r\n**You will need to update the repos you cloned to your hard drive**.

This removal effectively breaks NuGet package signing verification, which has the result of breaking the ability to restore NuGet packages.\r\n\r\nThis break in behavior is only observed with .NET 5 and .NET 6, which have NuGet package verification enabled (and it cannot be disabled). [NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56) has been observed on some distros already and we expect it to become pervasive quickly as more distros are updated to include more recent version of `NSS` and `ca-certificates` (with the VeriSign CA removed). We are in the process of releasing updated builds of .NET 5 and .NET 6 that have NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\nWe need developers, companies, and commercial providers to install (or otherwise use) updated builds of .NET 5 and .NET 6 if you rely on those .NET versions on Linux. If you adopt the updated .NET versions soon, you should not observe a break in functional behavior, and will be able to confidently update to newer versions of `NSS` and `ca-certificates` packages.\r\n\r\nUpdates: \r\n- [NuGet repository signature certificate will expire on April 14th, 2021](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/58)\r\n- [.NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions using NSS or ca-certificates](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/net-5-nuget-restore-failures-on-linux-distributions-using-nss-or-ca-certificates/) (NuGet blog)\r\n- [.NET April 2021 Updates – 5.0.5](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-april-2021-updates/) (.NET blog)\r\n- [.NET 6 Preview 3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6-preview-3/)\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease share your feedback on this topic and see what others are saying at:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/10712\r\n\r\n## Updated .NET builds\r\n\r\nNew .NET builds will be provided with NuGet package verification disabled on Linux and macOS. The following are the expected release dates:\r\n\r\n- [.NET SDK 5.0.202](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0) -- April 6, 2021.\r\n- [.NET 6 Preview 3](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) -- April 8, 2021.\r\n\r\nNew [container images](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-dotnet) will be published for Alpine, Debian, and Ubuntu on both of these dates, for the respective releases.\r\n\r\nThese builds include significant additional functionality beyond disabling NuGet package verification. We originally planned to release these builds as regular releases for all supported operating systems and architectures, targeting April 13th. We made two changes from our original release plan: earlier release dates and include the change in NuGet functionality for Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\n## Who is affected\r\n\r\n.NET 5+ users will be affected on any operating system that has removed the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority`. We are maintaining a list of [Linux distros that are known to be affected](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56).\r\n\r\n`nuget.exe` is sometimes used on Linux with Mono. This scenario is not affected.\r\n\r\nThere has been an [industry-wide movement to distrust the VeriSign root CA](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/03/12/distrust-symantec-tls-certificates/), including companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla. This may mean that at anytime in the future, [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212140) and [Microsoft](https://ccadb-public.secure.force.com/microsoft/IncludedCACertificateReportForMSFT) can remove `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority` from their trusted root CA list.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nThe NuGet team has [disabled the package verification feature](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGet.Client/pull/3979) for macOS and Linux. If needed, we will disable the feature for Windows at a later time. This change will be available in the updated .NET builds covered earlier.\r\n\r\nWe are also [talking to some Linux distro package maintainers](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/ca-certificates/-/issues/1) to ask them to delay the removal of the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority` (for code signing only). Even a month of grace would help a lot, to enable .NET users on Linux to adopt the newer .NET 5 and .NET 6 builds.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, this change does not affect .NET Core 3.1 and earlier versions. It does not affect .NET Framework. It does not affect any .NET functionality on Windows, at least not at this time.\r\n\r\n## More Context\r\n\r\nWe observed [NuGet Restore Issues on Debian Family Linux Distros](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/49) in January, 2021. This led us to discover that there has been an industry-wide movement to remove the `VeriSign Universal Root Certification Authority`.\r\n\r\nNuGet has historically relied on two key certificates:\r\n\r\n- NuGet Microsoft Author Signing Certificate Update - Expired January 27th, 2021\r\n- NuGet.org Repository Signing Certificate Update - Expires April 14th, 2021\r\n\r\nAfter those certificates expire, the NuGet client falls back to [timestamp verification](https://docs.microsoft.com/nuget/reference/signed-packages-reference), which enables package verification to still function. The timestamp verification relies on VeriSign root certificate authority. The absence of this root certificate authority being available on a machine means that timestamp verification is no longer functional, which causes package signature verification to fail.\r\n\r\nSecurity is very important to us. We are putting together a plan to use a new system that will allow us to re-enable package signing verification on all supported operating systems. We will have more to share on our future plans once we are sure that all systems are once again functional.\r\n\r\n[.NET 5 NuGet Restore Failures on Linux distributions](https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/56) provides more details on error messages, affected environments, and solutions.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/180","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"NuGet package restore broken on .NET 5+ with Removal of Trust of VeriSign CA\" (#180)"},{"Id":"837071846","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-30T21:15:03","Actor":"Nirmal4G","Number":"179","RawContent":null,"Title":"Preserve git refspec to local patches and branches after renamed origin's master","State":"closed","Body":"For all those who can't pull `master`, it should have renamed to `main`.\r\n\r\nTo preserve refspec to patches and branches, just changing the `heads/master` to `heads/main` should work.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n[remote \"origin\"]\r\n\turl = https://github.com/dotnet/your-repo\r\n-\tfetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n+\tfetch = +refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/master\r\n\ttagopt = --no-tags\r\n[branch \"master\"]\r\n\tremote = origin\r\n-\tmerge = refs/heads/master\r\n+\tmerge = refs/heads/main\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Putting this out there, if anyone else facing similar issue with git.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/179","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Preserve git refspec to local patches and branches after renamed origin's master\" (#179)"},{"Id":"826383777","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-09T18:01:29","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"178","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-26701 | .NET Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2021-26701 | .NET Core Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 5.0, .NET Core 3.1, and .NET Core 2.1.

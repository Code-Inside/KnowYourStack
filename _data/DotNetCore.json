As a result, while you can still use the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) to modify your FabricBot configuration, you can no longer save the changes. The only way to save changes to your configuration at the moment is to _export configuration_ from the portal and upload the exported configuration to `.github/fabricbot.json` in your repository. In this pull request, we are adding your FabricBot configuration to your repository at `.github/fabricbot.json` so that you can make changes to it going forward.\r\n\r\nWhile the [FabricBot Configuration Portal](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/bot/?repo=dotnet/coreclr) is the *only way* to modify your FabricBot configuration at the moment, we have a feature on our backlog to publish the JSON schema defining the structure of the FabricBot configuration file. With the JSON schema, you can (1) use a plaintext editor of your choice to modify the FabricBot configuration file and use the schema to validate the file after editing or (2) [configure](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings) VS Code to use the schema when editing FabricBot configuration file to take advantage of convenience features such as automatic code completion and field description on mouseover.\r\n\r\n[*Pull Request Create*](https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot/extensions/prcreate), a [MerlinBot](https://https://eng.ms/docs/products/1es-data-insights/merlinbot) Extension, was used to automatically create this pull request.

It seems I was mistaken when thinking that this was not the case, so I'm glad this repository is easily accessible to determine this.\r\n\r\nBut while doing this, I found it difficult to determine what commits were included in this particular .NET Standard version. I see that there's a tag `v2.1.0-prerelease.19126.1`, as well as branches `release/2.0.0`, `release/3.0`, and `release/3.0-preview9`. One of the machines I tested VS 2019 on had a `netstandard.dll` assembly, itself targeting .NETStandard v2.1.0, with AssemblyInformationalVersion `1.1.0+a5b5f2e1e369972c8ff1e2183979fab6099f52ef`; this commit is part of the `release/3.0` branch. However, another machine had a same-named assembly, targeting .NETCoreApp v3.0 and AssemblyInformationalVersion `3.0.0+4ac4c0367003fe3973a3648eb0715ddb0e3bbcea`, and I don't see that commit hash in this repository.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, [this blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/the-future-of-net-standard/) states that 2.1 will be the last version, but there is another prerelease tag `v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1` and [on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/standard/releases/tag/v2.2.0-prerelease.19564.1) it's labelled .NET 5.0 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nSo I have a few questions for understanding this repository:\r\n\r\n1. Since .NET Standard 2.1 is released, are there plans to continue development in this repository for e.g. the shared BCL going forward with .NET 5+?\r\n2. Are there multiple kinds of `netstandard.dll` for a single .NET Standard version? E.g. are there separate versions for .NET Framework to reference and for .NET Core / .NET 5+ to reference?\r\n3. Do the tags / branch names in this repository correspond to a .NET Standard version or something else?\r\n4.

Localy everything seems to build and run fine, however when Azure DevOps(VS version 2019) is used to build the solution there are 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. The famous error message is shown:\r\n\r\n                \"Error CS0012: The type 'Object' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced.

Google has led me to two possible solutions to tell the project what framework to use from the reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\"\r\n                  AdditionalProperties=\"TargetFramework=net452\">\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ProjectReference Include=\"..\\..\\..\\..\\foo\\foo.csproj\">\r\n      <SetTargetFramework>TargetFramework=net452</SetTargetFramework>\r\n      <Project>{xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxxx}</Project>\r\n      <<Name>foo</Name>\r\n</ProjectReference>\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't look like it's doing anything and the problem still persists.

The current implementation only works because `CryptoPool.Rent` happens to give back power-of-two arrays which are exactly the same size as the key.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to slice the data to the correct size.\r\n\r\nThis does not affect dotnet/runtime because the managed implementation of RSA OAEP is no longer used for OpenSSL RSA decryption. This change was introduced in dotnet/runtime#50063.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUnit tests were introduced to test RSA OAEP encryption with a 3072-bit RSA key. These tests will be forward-ported to dotnet/runtime.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nMinimal. The change is localized and understood that a `Slice` was missing.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43153","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix RSA OAEP decryption in OpenSSL with non-power-of-two keys lengths\" (#43153)"},{"Id":"1294682979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-06T23:50:10","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43152","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43152","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43152)"},{"Id":"1294679544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-05T19:29:57","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"43151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update branding to 3.1.28","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/43151","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update branding to 3.1.28\" (#43151)"},{"Id":"1272811676","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-25T04:15:13","Actor":"NegativeMjark","Number":"43149","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/3.1] Fix writing large arrays to anonymous pipes on linux","State":"closed","Body":"Increment the `bufPtr` when we can't write the array in a single syscall.

We want to compile it with AOT and generate libraries for Windows, Linux, and Android. We’re using .NET 9 and have already successfully compiled and tested AOT libraries for Windows and Linux. In these cases, we get a single library that bundles all other dependencies. However, we’re encountering an issue when compiling for Android: if we set the TargetFramework to \"net9-android\", instead of a single AOT library, the IDE builds an APK containing multiple dependent libraries, not a single one. If we set the TargetFramework to \"net9\", we get the error: \"Cross-OS native compilation is not supported.\" Do you know a solution to this problem?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/47801","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Compile native AOT library for Android in NET 9.0\" (#47801)"},{"Id":"2939859927","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-22T01:12:39","Actor":"MiYanni","Number":"47800","RawContent":null,"Title":"dotnet CLI: Rename project and command sub-folders","State":"open","Body":"Follow-up to: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/47746\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nOriginally, I was planning on doing these renames as separate PRs, but that will take forever to get merged. Instead, I've lumped together several renames into one. These are all *high-level* renames, and do not encompass individual file changes. That will be in another follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- **No source code changes at all**\r\n- Renamed `commands` folder to `Commands`\r\n  - To change folder casing, you need to rename it to something different (I did `Cmds`) and then changed it to `Commands`.\r\n- Renamed command sub-folders (for sub-commands) to match the style of the command folders\r\n  - For example, `Reference/dotnet-reference-add` became `Reference/Add`\r\n  - Some sub-command folders already matched this but with incorrect casing. So, to change casing, needed a 2-commit process. For example, `Workload/clean` became `Workload/CleanCmd` which then became `Workload/Clean`.\r\n- Renamed `dotnet.csproj` to `Microsoft.DotNet.Cli.csproj`\r\n  - Matches the namespace, which is normal practice.\r\n  - NOTE: Namespace alignment will be a completely different PR.\r\n- Renamed `dotnet` folder to `Microsoft.DotNet.Cli`\r\n  - Normal practice for the folder to match the project name.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n- Before (the first rename PR) and after (this PR)\r\n  - `src\\Cli\\dotnet\\commands\\dotnet-reference\\dotnet-reference-add`\r\n  - `src\\Cli\\Microsoft.DotNet.Cli\\Commands\\Reference\\Add`\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that `src\\Cli` is a \"product domain\" folder. Meaning, each folder within `src` is a different \"product\" in a mono-repo sense. That's how we've come to organize this repo.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nThere will be other `Microsoft.DotNet.Cli.XXXXX` projects as I'm refactoring things, so I really need everything to be consistent here. We already have `Microsoft.DotNet.Cli.Utils` and everything for the *Cli* will be prefixed with `Microsoft.DotNet.Cli`. Again, namespaces will be aligned *soon*. There are other planned renamings, but those are more focused on an individual level, or things like the `.resx` files being all named the same thing, or all the `test` folder related stuff for the CLI. There's a lot of work to do here, so bear with me.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/47800","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"dotnet CLI: Rename project and command sub-folders\" (#47800)"},{"Id":"2938986185","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-21T23:59:52","Actor":"github-actions[bot]","Number":"47790","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/9.0.3xx] Run `AddImplicitDefineConstants` after `PrepareForBuild`.","State":"closed","Body":"Backport of #45877 to release/9.0.3xx\n\n/cc @marcpopMSFT @teo-tsirpanis","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/47790","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/9.0.3xx] Run `AddImplicitDefineConstants` after `PrepareForBuild`.\" (#47790)"},{"Id":"2939748566","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-21T23:34:06","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"47799","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/10.0.1xx-preview3] Update dependencies from dotnet/runtime","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:198176f9-51ed-4865-a656-498eab967138)\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/runtime\n- **Subscription**: 198176f9-51ed-4865-a656-498eab967138\n- **Build**: [20250321.5](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=2668996)\n- **Date Produced**: March 21, 2025 11:09:18 PM UTC\n- **Commit**: [0a33e18a0bccc10a0c4646dbf5b0fc70cbb3aa44](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/commit/0a33e18a0bccc10a0c4646dbf5b0fc70cbb3aa44)\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/10.0-preview3\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Updates**:\n  -

See that issue for discussion.\n\n.NET binaries and installers have moved to a new domain -- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` -- backed by a new Content Delivery Network (CDN). You may need to make changes to adjust.\n\nTracking issue: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9674\n\n> .NET Team Status:\n> - azureedge.net scream tests are starting\n> - See: https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9676\n\n>  \n> Recommended action:\n> - Read [Critical: .NET Install links are changing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/critical-dotnet-install-links-are-changing/) for an overview.\n> - Update `azureedge.net` references\n> - Update local copies of install script\n> - Update pinned references to [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n> - Validate that firewall rules are resilient to using new domains.\n> \n> Last update: 2025.01.23\n> Next update: 2025.02.04\n\n## Context\n\nSome .NET binaries and installers have been hosted on Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) domains that end in `.azureedge.net`. These domains were hosted by [edg.io](https://edg.io/), which has [ceased operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/edgio-retirement-faq) due to bankruptcy. We [migrated to a new CDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/migrate-cdn-to-front-door) and will be using new domains going forward. \n\nWe expect`azureedge.net` domains to cease by 5/31 (at latest).\n\n## .NET Team Remediation\n\nNew domains were created:\n\n- `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` for signed official builds\n- `ci.dot.net` for unsigned builds\n\nTest links for new CDN:\n\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nTest links for old CDN:\n\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/health.txt\n- https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nThe following resources have been updated to use new domains.\n\n- [`releases-index.json`](https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json)\n- [.NET install script](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/)\n- [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570)\n- [CI short links](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/pull/15365)\n\nOther changes are in progress.\n\n## User Remediation\n\nPlease make the following replacements:\n\n- `dotnetcli.azureedge.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net` -> `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com`\n- `dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n- `dotnetbuilds.blob.core.windows.net` -> `ci.dot.net`\n\nAll the new domains are path-compatible with old domains, as they share the same origin.\n\nPlease also make the following changes:\n\n- Update local copies of the install script\n- Update setup-dotnet Action references\n- Validate that firewall rules work with the new domains\n\n## Install script\n\nThe [.NET install script](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script) is used to install .NET from our CDN. We are changing CDNs (documented in a following section), which requires us to change the install script to use the new CDN.\n\nUpdated scripts:\n\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh`\n- `https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.ps1`\n\nNotes: \n\n- Users who have local copies of these scripts will need to update their copies.\n- Users who rely on the remote copy (at the URLs above) do not need to do anything other than validate no observed change in behavior (due to new domains and CDNs being used).\n\nTracking PRs:\n\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #554](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/554)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #555](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/555)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts/issues #558](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/issues/558)\n- [dotnet/install-scripts #564](https://github.com/dotnet/install-scripts/pull/564)\n- [dotnet/docs #44052](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/pull/44052)\n\n## Official builds\n\nOfficial builds and JSON files are hosted via a CDN, available for use by the install script and other installers.\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net\n\nNotes:\n\n- Official builds are tested and signed by Microsoft. A `microsoft.com` domain was chosen to reflect that.\n- We also [plan to stop using dowload.visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9675) for new content. That CDN will continue to function.\n- [Microsoft.Deployment.DotNet.Releases](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Deployment.DotNet.Releases) has been [updated](https://github.com/dotnet/deployment-tools/pull/423)\n\nYou can change from old to new domains by changing the domain section of the URL. The other parts of the URL do not need to change.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Runtime/8.0.11/dotnet-runtime-8.0.11-linux-x64.tar.gz\n- New: https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n- Old: https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/release-metadata/releases-index.json\n\nA set of short links are available for official builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/dotnet-sdk-win-x64.zip\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/8.0/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-x64.tar.gz\n \nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- Currently forward to:  https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net.\n- Will be changed to forward to: https://build.dotnet.microsoft.com.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in mid January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/core #9683](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9683)\n\n## CI builds\n\nContinuous integration (CI) builds are hosted via a CDN, available via the install script and GitHub README files.\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net\n\nNote: CI builds include a mix of tested and untested builds, signed and unsigned builds.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- New: https://ci.dot.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n- Old: https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net/public/Runtime/9.0.1-servicing.24610.11/dotnet-runtime-9.0.1-win-x64.exe\n\nA set of short links are available for CI builds.\n\nLink pattern:`https://aka.ms/dotnet/[x.y]/daily/[package]`.\n\nExample URLs:\n\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/dotnet-runtime-win-x64.exe\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/9.0/daily/aspnetcore-runtime-linux-arm.tar.gz\n- https://aka.ms/dotnet/10.0.1xx/daily/dotnet-sdk-osx-arm64.pkg\n\nThese links produce`301` HTTP results that forward to our CDN.\n\n- New builds now forward to: https://ci.dot.net\n- Old builds forward to:  https://dotnetbuilds.azureedge.net.\n\nWe expect these links to be changed in mid January.\n\nTracking PR:\n\n- [dotnet/core #9683](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/9683)\n\nCI build pages use the CI short links.\n\nExample build pages:\n\n- [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/project/dogfooding.md#daily-builds-table)\n- [dotnet/aspnetcore](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/README.md#nightly-builds)\n- [dotnet/sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/documentation/package-table.md)\n\n## Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions\n\n- Major versions tags for [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet/issues/570) have been updated. References to pinned versions will require updating to the most recent version.\n- We expect that GitHub Enterprise Server will be addressed in January.\n- Azure DevOps [`UseDotnetTask`](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/use-dotnet-v2?view=azure-pipelines) will be updated in January\n- We do not yet have a date for updating [Azure DevOps Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/devops/server/).\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/336","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Critical: .NET install domains and URLs are changing\" (#336)"},{"Id":"2653140062","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T19:35:17","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"335","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET November 2024 Updates","State":"open","Body":"# .NET November 2024 Updates\n\nToday, we are releasing .NET 9 , .NET 8.0.11, and .NET 6.0.36 updates.\n\n* https://github.com/dotnet/core/discussions/9599 \n* [.NET 9.0 Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/9.0)\n* [.NET 8.0.11 and .NET SDK 8.0.404](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/8.0/8.0.11/8.0.11.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/8.0))\n* [.NET 6.0.36 and .NET SDK 6.0.427](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.36/6.0.36.md) ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/6.0))\n\nAlso announced at [.NET Updates in November 2024](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-and-dotnet-framework-november-2024-servicing-updates/).\n\nThis issue will be updated if there are any additional releases during the month.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/335","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".NET November 2024 Updates\" (#335)"},{"Id":"2653127024","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-12T19:27:36","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"334","RawContent":null,"Title":"Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-43498 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability","State":"open","Body":"# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2024-43498 | .NET Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\n\n## <a name=\"executive-summary\"></a>Executive summary\n\nMicrosoft is releasing this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in .NET 9.0.

See that issue for discussion.\n\nWe'll be reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3 and encourage ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to update to it. In this post I'll provide more background.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n>\n> This post only applies if you're using ASP.NET Core **on .NET Framework**. If you're using ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Core 2.x, it is [already out of support][netcore-support], and you should upgrade to a supported version such as .NET 8.\n\n### Background\n\nEarly versions of ASP.NET Core were provided for .NET Framework and .NET Core. Since 2021, [ASP.NET Core 2.1 is supported][aspnet21-support] only when running on .NET Framework. ASP.NET Core 2.2 has been out of support on all platforms since 2019.\n\nThis happened before we had a [predictable schedule and alternate releases of Standard Term Support (STS) and Long Term Support (LTS)][core-release-policies]. Many users upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2, not realizing that this reduced their support duration.\n\nAs a result, we now have users that are running on the unsupported version of ASP.NET Core 2.2 on .NET Framework.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support        |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | [Supported][aspnet21-support] |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019       |\n\n### How to stay supported\n\n* If you're on .NET Core, you should upgrade to .NET 8 and use ASP.NET Core 8\n* If you're on .NET Framework, you can either migrate to .NET 8 or upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.3, which is the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1 (see below)\n\nSince ASP.NET Core 2.x for .NET Framework is just a set of packages, downgrading isn't that easy; there are well over one hundred packages and not all of them have 2.x version numbers. To make matters worse, there are NuGet packages out there that also upgraded to ASP.NET Core 2.2. Downgrading to ASP.NET Core 2.1 would mean that NuGet fails to restore these dependencies with errors.\n\nIn order to make this easier, we'll reship ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, thus facilitating this downgrade as a package upgrade.\n\nYou might wonder why we don't reship ASP.NET Core 2.2 as 2.3 instead. The answer is breaking changes. ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago, while ASP.NET Core 2.1 kept being supported. We feel it would be wrong to force ASP.NET Core 2.1 users to accommodate those breaking changes in order to stay supported.\n\nUsers on ASP.NET Core 2.2 are unsupported and won't receive any security updates. Our priority is to help those users to get onto a supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework.\n\nBy reshipping ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3, we provide users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 an off ramp to the supported version via a regular NuGet upgrade. Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 will also be pulled forward to 2.3, but since it's the same code as 2.1, there are no breaking changes. Moving forward, all updates to ASP.NET Core 2.1 will be published as 2.3. However, if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.1, you don't need to move to 2.3 in order to get updates. If we find security issues with 2.1 packages, those will be marked as vulnerable and the recommended version will be versioned as 2.3. Except for the version number changes, that's how ASP.NET Core 2.1 works today, so there are no changes for you and you don't need to preemptively update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 to receive those warnings.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n>\n> Please note that if you're using ASP.NET Core 2.2, you will *not* be getting vulnerability warnings via NuGet because the product is out of support. There is no change here, this has been the case since ASP.NET Core 2.2 went out of support five years ago. Therefore, if you're on ASP.NET Core 2.2, we strongly recommend to update to ASP.NET Core 2.3 as soon as possible in order to receive security fixes again.\n\nWe understand that this can be confusing, but we believe it's the best compromise to help ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to get back onto a supported train.\n\n| Product          | .NET Framework Support                          |\n| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.1 | Supported with ASP.NET Core 2.3                 |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.2 | Ended December 23, 2019                         |\n| ASP.NET Core 2.3 | [Supported, same code as 2.1][aspnet21-support] |\n\n### Summary\n\nFor .NET Core, ASP.NET Core 2.x is and remains unsupported.\n\nThe following statements are specific for ASP.NET Core 2.x on .NET Framework:\n\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.1 is and remains supported**.\n* **ASP.NET Core 2.2 is and remains unsupported**.\n* **We're re-versioning ASP.NET Core 2.1 as ASP.NET Core 2.3** to allow ASP.NET Core 2.2 users to move to a supported version.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.1 should update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. Since it's the same code as ASP.NET Core 2.1, there are no breaking changes or feature additions. This operation won't require any code changes on your side. But it will make your life easier as all future updates will be versioned as 2.3.x, so you'll have a consistent set of versions.\n* **Users on ASP.NET Core 2.2 update to ASP.NET Core 2.3**. This will ensure you get off of the unsupported version and thus will get security fixes. You should expect breaking changes as you're effectively downgrading to the code from ASP.NET Core 2.1. If you can't live without the features being added in ASP.NET Core 2.2, you'll have to migrate to a supported .NET version with those features, such as .NET 8.\n* **This does not extend or reduce the support durations of any products, nor which versions of .NET are supported where**. It's purely a re-versioning of ASP.NET Core 2.1 in order to help the math in the package manager. The net effect of this change is that the last supported version of ASP.NET Core for .NET Framework is also the highest minor version (2.3).\n\n[aspnet21-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/aspnet/2.1-packages\n[netcore-support]: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core\n[core-release-policies]: https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-policies.md\n\n> This issue is a locked mirror of https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/58598.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nThe `CopyWithPrivateKey` methods that combine a certificate with its associated private key fail on macOS 15 when using in-memory (ephemeral) keys.  This failure is most commonly seen when creating new certificates via `CertificateRequest.CreateSelfSigned` or when loading a certificate and key from a PEM file (or files) with `X509Certificate2.CreateFromPem`, which utilize the affected methods.\r\n\r\nCallers of these methods on macOS 15 (\"Sequoia\") will receive a `CryptographicException`, specifically `Interop+AppleCrypto+AppleCommonCryptoCryptographicException: The specified item is no longer valid. It may have been deleted from the keychain.`  The `dotnet dev-certs https` command relies on `CertificateRequest.CreateSelfSigned` and fails with this error.\r\n\r\nThis issue affects .NET 6, .NET 8, and .NET 9. The issue is addressed in the upcoming .NET 6.0.34, .NET 8.0.10, and 9.0.0-rc2 releases, scheduled for release in October 2024.\r\n\r\n## Root Cause\r\n\r\nmacOS 15 uses a different status code to indicate a key is not in a Keychain than prior versions do.\r\n\r\n## Workarounds\r\n\r\nIf you have not already upgraded to macOS 15 from a prior version and use .NET, you are not impacted by this issue.  If you are planning to upgrade to macOS 15, the workaround is to upgrade to .NET 6.0.34. .NET 8.0.10, or .NET 9.0.0-rc2 (scheduled for October 2024) prior to upgrading to macOS 15.\r\n\r\nLoading a certificate and its associated private key from a PKCS#12/PFX are not affected.  If you are using an application that supports loading a certificate (and associated private key) by either PFX or PEM, converting your PEM contents to PFX - and updating configuration appropriately - may unblock you.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/324","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Certificate Issues on macOS 15 (\"Sequoia\")\" (#324)"},{"Id":"2517880984","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-10T21:26:30","Actor":"rbhanda","Number":"323","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 9 RC 1","State":"open","Body":"# Announcement\r\n\r\nWe are pleased to announce the release of .NET 9 Release Candidate 1.\r\n\r\nThis release contains the following improvements:\r\n\r\n## **📚Libraries**\r\n\r\n* [WebSocket `Keep-Alive` Ping and Timeout APIs](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#websocket-keep-alive-ping-and-timeout)\r\n* [Add ZLib, Brotli compression options](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#add-zlib-and-brotli-compression-options)\r\n* [Add TarEntry.DataOffset](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#add-tarentrydataoffset)\r\n* [`HttpClientFactory` no longer logs header values by default](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#httpclientfactory-no-longer-logs-header-values-by-default)\r\n* [Out-of-proc Meter wildcard listening](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md#Out-of-proc-Meter-wildcard-listening)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/libraries.md)\r\n\r\n## **🛠️ SDK**\r\n\r\n* [Workload History](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/sdk.md#workload-history)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/sdk.md)\r\n\r\n## **🌐 ASP.NET Core**\r\n\r\n* [Improvements to SignalR distributed tracing](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#improvements-to-signalr-distributed-tracing)\r\n* [Keep-alive timeout for WebSockets](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#keep-alive-timeout-for-websockets)\r\n* [Keyed DI in middleware](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#keyed-di-in-middleware)\r\n* [Override `InputNumber` type attribute](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#override-inputnumber-type-attribute)\r\n* [Trust the ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate on Linux](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md#trust-the-aspnet-core-https-development-certificate-on-linux)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/aspnetcore.md)\r\n\r\n## **📱 .NET MAUI**\r\n\r\n* [Added `HorizontalTextAlignment.Justify`](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/dotnetmaui.md#added-horizontaltextalignmentjustify)\r\n\r\n* Full [release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/dotnetmaui.md)\r\n\r\n## Get started\r\n\r\nTo get started with .NET 9, [install the .NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0).\r\n\r\nIf you're on Windows using Visual Studio, we recommend installing the latest [Visual Studio 2022 preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/). .NET 9 is now can be installed directly through the Visual Studio installer starting with Visual Studio 2022 17.12 Preview 2.\r\n\r\nYou can also use Visual Studio Code and the [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit) extension with .NET 9.\r\n\r\nYou can find [.NET 9 RC 1 Installer & Binaries](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/preview/rc1/9.0.0-rc.1.md) on GitHub.\r\n\r\n## Team Announcements & Discussions\r\n\r\nDiscuss this release with the product teams on GitHub through the announcements for this release.\r\n\r\n* [.NET MAUI](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/discussions/24698)\r\n* ASP.NET Core(https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/discussions/57787)\r\n\r\n## Stay up-to-date with .NET 9\r\n\r\nYou can stay up-to-date with all the features of .NET 9 with:\r\n\r\n* [What's new in .NET 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-9/overview)\r\n* [What's new in ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/release-notes/aspnetcore-9.0)\r\n* [What's new in .NET MAUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/whats-new/dotnet-9)\r\n* [What's new in EF Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/whatsnew)\r\n* [Breaking Changes in .NET 9](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/compatibility/9.0)\r\n* [.NET 9 Releases](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/9.0/README.md)\r\n\r\nFor .NET 9 previews we are utilizing GitHub Discussions to make announcements.

See that issue for discussion.\r\n\r\nWe [announced Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-the-new-microsoftdatasqlclient/) in the first half of 2019 and [shipped the first stable](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-blog/released-general-availability-of-microsoft-data-sqlclient-1-0/ba-p/825859) package later that year. That release [coincided with .NET Core 3.0](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-0/#introducing-the-new-sqlclient). We’ve been developing [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient) in the [dotnet/SqlClient](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient) repo since that time, over the last five years. It’s now time to start the deprecation process for the [System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient) package. We plan to take a staged process to deprecation, with the intent to align support changes and associated code transition activities between these libraries to natural migration points between .NET major versions.\r\n\r\nAll System.Data.SqlClient users are encouraged to transition to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. We offer improvements and significantly higher support via the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package.\r\n\r\n### Plan\r\n\r\nWe intend to deprecate the System.Data.SqlClient package in stages.\r\n- **Before .NET 9 GA:**\r\n  - Publish a new 5.0.0 package, including the following changes.\r\n  - Remove support for .NET 7 and earlier and .NET Framework 4.6.1 and earlier.\r\n  - Publish assets for the following target frameworks: .NET 8, .NET Framework 4.6.2, .NET Standard 2.0.\r\n  - Add [Obsolete attributes](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/attributes/general#obsolete-attribute) to .NET 8 and .NET Standard 2.0 assets. This will generate new warnings for .NET 8+ and .NET Standard users.\r\n  - Continue to offer security servicing, for .NET 8, and .NET Framework 4.6.2+ application users.\r\n- **After .NET 9 GA:**\r\n  - No change\r\n  - We will not support this package for .NET 9+ application users.\r\n- **After .NET 8 EOL:**\r\n  - Remove support for .NET 8 users (the .NET 8 library will be removed).\r\n  - Maintain support for .NET Framework 4.6.2+ users.\r\n  - Security servicing will be provided via .NET Framework, not the package, at that point.\r\n  - We do not expect to update the package again after this point.\r\n  - We will not mark the package as deprecated since it will only support .NET Framework users with an implementation provided by .NET Framework.\r\n\r\nWe will remove support in the package for unsupported .NET and .NET Framework versions at various stages of this deprecation plan. Users affected by those changes are encouraged to move to a supported .NET or .NET Framework version and to adopt the Microsoft.Data.SqlClient package.\r\n\r\nWe decided to remove support for .NET 6 since it will go EOL shortly after this new package is released, even though .NET 6 will still be supported at the time. Publishing a .NET 8 library significantly simplifies the plan, both in terms of what we will deliver and what we need to explain.\r\n\r\nFor .NET dates, see [.NET Releases.](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md) .NET 9 will [GA in November](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/releases.md) of this year. .NET 8 will go EOL in November, 2026.\r\n\r\nThe current package version of [System.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.SqlClient) is 4.8.6, at the time of writing. These changes will be made with a 5.0.0 version and later.\r\n\r\n**Note:** _This deprecation doesn’t apply to the System.Data.SqlClient namespace in .NET Framework._\r\n\r\n### Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\r\n\r\nDaily downloads of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient on nuget.org are nearing 50% higher than System.Data.SqlClient. We expect the gap in usage between the two libraries will continue to increase. Microsoft.Data.SqlClient is the best library we offer to access SQL Server.\r\n\r\nWe are committed to providing high-quality, performance-driven, and secure data access technologies. We strongly encourage users to transition to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient. It is actively maintained and supports the latest SQL Server features.\r\n\r\n### How to migrate? \r\n\r\nAdd the NuGet package to your project, then update your references and using statements. Our [porting cheat sheet](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/blob/master/porting-cheat-sheet.md) provides a step-by-step set of changes you may need to make.\r\n\r\n1. **Update your project references:** Replace references to System.Data.SqlClient with Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.\r\n2. **Modify your using statements:** Update your using statements in your code files from System.Data.SqlClient to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.\r\n3. **Test your application:** Thoroughly test your application to ensure that it works as expected after the migration.\r\n\r\nWe also plan to [support semi-automatic migration](https://github.com/dotnet/upgrade-assistant/issues/1593) via [.NET Upgrade Assistant](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/upgrade-assistant).\r\n\r\n**Support & Feedback:** If you have any questions or need assistance with the migration, please reach out through our [official support channels](https://support.microsoft.com/) or join the discussion on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues).\r\n\r\n**Resources**\r\n- [Frequently Asked Questions - dotnet/SqlClient Wiki - GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions)\r\n- [Introduction to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient namespace](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/introduction-microsoft-data-sqlclient-namespace?view=sql-server-ver16)\r\n- [SQL Server and ADO.NET (Microsoft.Data.SqlClient)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/ado-net/sql)\r\n- [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient API Browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.data.sqlclient)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/322","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Announcement: System.Data.SqlClient package is now deprecated\" (#322)"},{"Id":"2464032272","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-13T19:08:47","Actor":"jamesmontemagno","Number":"321","RawContent":null,"Title":".NET 9 Preview 7","State":"open","Body":"We are pleased to announce the release of .NET 9 Preview 7.

As time has gone on, we have added some special casing for things, and it is clear that some control would be helpful here for a developer to have access to.\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\n\r\n- Add a feature that would allow for customizing loading of parts\r\n- Currently, the loading occurs before we have a chance to modify features, so we would have to have a way to intercept that as well."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2023-01-08T03:30:56.8094363Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":695}

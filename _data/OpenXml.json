Or maybe it's possible to mark this method as public?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @f1nzer in https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/discussions/1121_"},{"Id":"20028836982","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-02-02T01:20:29","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1117","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Update ROADMAP.md\" (#1117) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Move a few items in the roadmap per current plans"},{"Id":"20028823608","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-02-02T01:19:24","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1118","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Remove extra usings in generated code\" (#1118) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"20027513809","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-02-01T23:20:34","Actor":"mikeebowen","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1108","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Add Examples to solution\" (#1108) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"This adds the samples to the solution."},{"Id":"20027493878","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-02-01T23:18:45","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1117","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Update ROADMAP.md\" (#1117) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Move a few items in the roadmap per current plans"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2022-02-11T03:30:28.6653357Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":664}

Similar for example to how a save-as operation in an editor would work.  There's some degree of surprise in the current behaviour.\r\n"},{"Id":"28226937315","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-04-05T16:04:27","Actor":"mikeebowen","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1364","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Port customXML fix to v2.20\" (#1364) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"See https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1350"},{"Id":"28226878121","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-04-05T16:02:01","Actor":"mikeebowen","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1375","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Update to CodeQL v2\" (#1375) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"28225174918","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-04-05T14:58:53","Actor":"mikeebowen","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1384","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Update README for release of v2.20.0\" (#1384) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2023-04-06T03:30:26.5316813Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":779}

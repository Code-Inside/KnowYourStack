When Office team provides CT_ExtensionList and CT_Extension types in xsd definitions, we have been using specialized CT_<feature>ExtensionList/CT_<feature>Extension types to map these. The reason goes back to early days where it was confusing and difficult to just use CT_ExtensionList for all the features due to name collisions. However, it's possible we could have handled this differently. The CT_Extension class makes use of uri attributes to associate each extension for specific features.\r\nThis would of course be a breaking change and would require refactoring any code using the extensions.\r\n\r\n2. Our use of the uri attributes has not been consistent and some cleanup is likely needed there. This may also involve coordination with our Open Specifications extension documentation as some guids used as uri may not be listed.\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"36597785369","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-03-15T19:31:26","Actor":"dependabot[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1696","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Bump danielpalme/ReportGenerator-GitHub-Action from 5.2.2 to 5.2.3\" (#1696) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Bumps [danielpalme/ReportGenerator-GitHub-Action](https://github.com/danielpalme/reportgenerator-github-action) from 5.2.2 to 5.2.3.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/danielpalme/reportgenerator-github-action/releases\">danielpalme/ReportGenerator-GitHub-Action's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>5.2.3</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/danielpalme/reportgenerator-github-action/issues/656\">#656</a> Changed handling of files which are not found in source directory</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/danielpalme/ReportGenerator-GitHub-Action/commit/7a0988e399533f3680a732dceda1a967cafdafcd\"><code>7a0988e</code></a> 5.2.3</li>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/danielpalme/reportgenerator-github-action/compare/5.2.2...5.2.3\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=danielpalme/ReportGenerator-GitHub-Action&package-manager=github_actions&previous-version=5.2.2&new-version=5.2.3)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

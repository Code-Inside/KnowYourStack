The main benefit of this change is it removes reliance on all inner workings on the namespace id. This was a hard coded value that was essentially a magic number for each namespace. This replaces that with a struct that handles the comparisons (`OpenXmlNamespace`) as well as a type that wraps that to identify a qualified name (`OpenXmlQualifiedName`). This change also makes it clear where a string is a name, a namespace, a prefix, etc.\r\n\r\nThis does not update the generated files to not use namespace ids. That is still in place, but is the last place where a namespace id is needed."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"PowerTools":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2021-01-21T05:30:39.9812041Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":810}

Proposed API changes are here:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\npublic interface IPackageFeature\r\n{\r\n  IPackage Package { get; }\r\n\r\n+ bool CanReload { get; }\r\n\r\n+ void Reload(FileMode mode, FileAccess access);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could *automatically* be supported for files opened with paths or streams, but if a package is given, then it would not be supported (since we didn't manage the package) without additional information from a user."},{"Id":"26346155160","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-01-10T22:17:16","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1299","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Replace System.IO.Packaging.Package with custom abstraction\" (#1299) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"System.IO.Packaging is used to handle the package and parts.

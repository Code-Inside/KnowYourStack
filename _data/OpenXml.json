However, we have software at our company that very much depends on this attribute to determine XML namespaces and attribute names based on .NET properties. (An example would be finding the \"anchorx\" XML attribute name for the TextWrap.AnchorX .NET property.)\r\n\r\nI looked around for alternative ways of retrieving this information in the current version of the library, but came up empty.\r\n* The pull request refers to OpenXmlElement.RawAttributes, but this property appears to no longer exist. There is a RawState property, but along with the Metadata property, it's not accessible from outside the library.\r\n* Similarly, the ElementMetadata and AttributeMetadata classes are internal, making it impossible to (say) call ElementMetadata.Create\\<TextWrap\\>() and read the results without resorting to reflection.\r\n* While OpenXmlElement does have a public way of retrieving OpenXmlAttributes, the OpenXmlAttribute struct doesn't contain the .NET property name.\r\n\r\nPlease add back a public way of retrieving schema metadata."},{"Id":"14469486074","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-12-09T15:56:00","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/826","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Remove deployment to myget\" (#826) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"The myget feed we've been using has been retired.

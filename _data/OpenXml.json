However, the tool appears to open all files read-write, which means I can't run my own Packaging code while I have a diff open in Tool.\r\n\r\nThis is frustrating because debugging packaging/openxml code often consists of finding a problem in the diff, fixing your code, and then attempting to re-export your file. Since Tool has the file locked, the only way to write a new version is to quit Tool, run your code, quit your code (because it won't open a file open elsewhere), and then go through the entire diff process again.\r\n\r\nI don't see any way to change a file using the Tool, so it does not appear there is any need for the files to be opened read-write. Changing this to read-only, even if just in diff, would greatly improve workflow."},{"Id":"24848327327","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-10-26T17:44:37","Actor":"Th3AnG3L","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1219","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Bug with Open XML SDK\" (#1219) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Hello i'm having an issue..\r\nI download from nuget latest version 2.18.0\r\nand on my pc program that i build on vb.net works fine..\r\nBut i put the program on another computer and where it uses the library shows error:\r\n\r\nSystem.IO.FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly 'DocumentFormat.OpenXml, Version=2.7.2.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=8fb06cb64d019a17' or one of its dependencies.

You may find a data sample with absolute path here: \r\nhttps://github.com/Asbjoedt/CLISC/blob/master/Docs/Mappe1.xlsx\r\n\r\nMethod that ought to work\r\n```csharp\r\nusing DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging;\r\nusing DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet;\r\nusing DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Office2013.ExcelAc;\r\n\r\npublic bool Check_AbsolutePath(string filepath)\r\n{\r\n    bool absolutepath = false;\r\n\r\n    using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheet = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(filepath, false))\r\n    {\r\n        if (spreadsheet.WorkbookPart.Workbook.AbsolutePath != null)\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"--> Absolute path to local directory detected\");\r\n            absolutepath = true;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return absolutepath;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Observed behavior**\r\nNo absolute path is found in spreadsheet despite workbook.xml has absolutepath. XML attribute is \"x15ac:absPath\". I need to remove absolute paths in spreadsheets, which I cannot do if they cannot be found.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nAbsolute path was found as get and i should be able to remove it by set \"\".\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windows 11\r\n - .NET Target: I dunno, I just use C# in Visual Studio as \"console application\"\r\n - DocumentFormat.OpenXml Version: 2.18.0\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThx for your attention, I hope you can fix this.\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2023-10-15T03:30:24.3035438Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":744}

issue \"New ImagePart media added with extension .bin \" (#1488) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to an original bug https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1305 _\"New ImagePart is created as .bin instead of real extension\"_ which is still an issue with the most recent 2.20.0 release.\r\n\r\nWhen adding a new `ImagePart` the media in the bundled package has an extension of `.bin` instead of `.jpg` etc.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\nIf applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nCreate a new document and add an `ImagePart` using the following code:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// Load an image and get the appropriate mime type\r\nvar image = System.Drawing.Image.LoadFromFile(\"myphoto.jpg\");\r\nvar codes = ImageCodecInfo.GetImageDecoders();\r\nvar mimeType = codes.First(c => c.FormatID == image.RawFormat.Guid).MimeType;\r\n\r\nvar imagePart = mainPart.AddImagePart(mimeType); // image/jpeg\r\n\r\nusing var stream = new MemoryStream();\r\nimage.Save(stream, image.RawFormat);\r\nstream.Position = 0;\r\nimagePart.FeedData(stream);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Observed behavior**\r\nThe media is added to the word document package with .bin extension\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe media is added to the word document package with .jpg extension\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windows 10\r\n - Office version: 2306 - 16529.20154\r\n - .NET Target: .NET Core

I have discussed the situation with my manager (in CC), and as we are not able to assist further with this issue from an Office perspective, we will proceed with placing our support request into archival. If you have further questions within the scope of this issue, please do reopen the support request!\r\n\r\nYou may receive an invitation from Microsoft to complete a brief web feedback request. Your feedback is very important to us. We use it to continually improve our service. We would appreciate it if you can take the time to complete this feedback request.\r\n\r\nIn addition, if you would like to discuss any feedback or the case itself, you can contact me or my manager using the contact information in my signature.\r\n\r\nBelow is a summary of the support request for your records:\r\n\r\nIssue: With one of the production servers, there is an error that occurs when trying to export an Excel file by using a function with OpenXML, which receives some information from an SQL server and executes a stored procedure – the error says “Unable to create mutex. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80131464)”. The error does not occur on any other server or locally, and also has occurred before but has disappeared and reappeared in the meantime.\r\n\r\nScope:\r\nWe will consider this case solved when the script executes successfully on the affected server, if technically achievable.\r\nAlso, if we provide a technical answer on why this goal is not reachable under the given Scenario/Architecture, the issue will be considered solved.\r\nIf the causes are related to 3rd party code, we can only explain them and act as resource for you when addressing the issue with the 3rd party support.\r\n\r\nAssessment: As the configuration from an IIS point-of-view is correct and works as expected on both servers, and the issue occurs before Office is involved with OpenXML, our recommendation is to open a new issue on the OpenXML team’s GitHub page and explain the situation there; this way, the library’s team would be able to provide more information on what is causing this behaviour. Here is the link for their GitHub page for when you have the opportunity: [Issues · dotnet/Open-XML-SDK · GitHub](https://ddec1-0-en-ctp.trendmicro.com/wis/clicktime/v1/query?url=https%3a%2f%2fgithub.com%2fdotnet%2fOpen-XML-SDK%2fissues&umid=d22b16bc-d748-4cb4-83ff-7cb9d04b8955&auth=b0e6babbab0b4c41f3232ed00b99e652b05623ce-1c505fa4a49fe064e18c438185515b5374fcc6fb)\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you please help us understand why this happens and how we can still use the OpenXML library and make it work? \r\n \r\n[Issue Description.docx](https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/files/13237365/Issue.Description.docx)\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"44660743244","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-12-10T19:52:07","Actor":"dependabot[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1848","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Bump Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.PublicApiAnalyzers and Microsoft.NETFramework.ReferenceAssemblies\" (#1848) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Bumps [Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.PublicApiAnalyzers](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers) and [Microsoft.NETFramework.ReferenceAssemblies](https://github.com/Microsoft/dotnet).

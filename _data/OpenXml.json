I'd like to see it continue becoming more flexible so that people can develop their own packages/parts if needed (if anything, this should simplify some of the behavior of our own implementations that currently need InternalsVisibleTo)"},{"Id":"28348005854","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-04-11T23:08:39","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1396","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"Update README.md\" (#1396) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"28348002539","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-04-11T23:08:24","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1397","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Remove EnumString and introduce IEnumValue and IEnumFactory<>\" (#1397) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"This reworks how we're doing enum parsing so we are no longer using C# enums. That incurred a cost while parsing and writing and was challenging for AOT and trimming due to its use of reflection. This now uses a struct that implements two interfaces that allows us to have almost free parsing/writing. The only thing here that costs is checking if a value is valid or potentially getting the version.\n"},{"Id":"28347832227","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-04-11T22:55:53","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1396","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Update README.md\" (#1396) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"28347810827","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-04-11T22:54:01","Actor":"tomjebo","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1395","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Update README.md\" (#1395) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Add \"Beta1\""},{"Id":"28347785482","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-04-11T22:51:55","Actor":"AlfredHellstern","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1395","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Update README.md\" (#1395) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Add \"Beta1\""}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2023-04-14T03:30:25.8440874Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":727}

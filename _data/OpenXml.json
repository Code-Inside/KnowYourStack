I found some examples of OpenXML using SAX, so I tried to switch to OpenXML, but it didn't help me. I tried to remove all my code (reading from DB, etc.) to try if that works, but I still get OutOfMemoryException.\r\n\r\nMy code is based on [http://polymathprogrammer.com/2012/08/06/how-to-properly-use-openxmlwriter-to-write-large-excel-files/](url)\r\n\r\n**Information**\r\n\r\n- .NET Target: .NET Core 3.1\r\n- DocumentFormat.OpenXml Version: 2.11.3\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** Same code is working fine in .NET Framework 4.7.2 with same DocumentFormat.OpenXml version.\r\n\r\n**Repro**\r\nThis is simple code that I use at the moment.

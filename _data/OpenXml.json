issue \"OpenXmlValidator breaks digital signatures.\" (#1358) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"**Describe the bug**\r\nValidating a `SpreadsheetDocument` using `OpenXmlValidator` breaks digital signatures.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![styles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7642579/226412198-950e823c-7ce6-41e4-b8f2-eea7b7ca50df.PNG)\r\n![workbook](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7642579/226412205-0915e04a-a8f7-49dc-849e-8e51ee16d8cb.PNG)\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```csharp\r\nusing var document = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(\"valid.xlsx\", isEditable: true);\r\nvar validator = new OpenXmlValidator();\r\n// This line breaks the signatures\r\nvalidator.Validate(document);\r\ndocument.Dispose();\r\n```\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\nCreate .xlsx file using Microsoft Excel and add digital signature or signature line and sign it.\r\n\r\n**Observed behavior**\r\nSome parts (`styles.xml` and `workbook.xml`) get modified, which breaks digital signatures.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNo changes should happen when simply validating a package.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n- OS: Windows\r\n- .NET Target: net6.0\r\n- DocumentFormat.OpenXml Version: 2.19.0\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nWhen the document is loaded with the \"isEditable:false\" option, the issue does not appear to occur."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2023-03-29T03:30:27.0213317Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":709}

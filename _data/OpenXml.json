I have created several xUnit-based projects that test the same features for the following versions:\n- v2.19.0, where everything works as expected,\n- v3.0.0, where everything works as expected after having made the changes related to `Package` being obsolete,\n- v3.0.1, where the features are first broken, and,\n- v3.1.1, where the features are still broken.\n\n**Observed behavior**\n1. Since v3.0.1, `WordprocessingDocument` instances created using `WordprocessingDocument.FromFlatOpcString(xml)` no longer have the relationship parts. Up to and including v3.0.0, those parts appeared.\n2. Since v3.0.1, cloning a `WordprocessingDocument` instance created using `WordprocessingDocument.FromFlatOpcString(xml)` can no longer be cloned. Calling the `Clone()` method or its overloads will throw an error.\n\n**Expected behavior**\n1. Flat OPC documents are created correctly (as before).\n2. `WordprocessingDocument` instances can be cloned (as before).\n\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\n - OS: any (tested on macOS and Windows 11)\n - Office version: any\n - .NET Target: any (tested using .NET 8 and .NET Framework 4.7.2)\n - DocumentFormat.OpenXml Version: since v3.0.1\n"},{"Id":"43235756636","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-10-26T20:29:50","Actor":"ThomasBarnekow","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1813","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Linq namespace-related classes have missing XName fields.\" (#1813) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"**Describe the bug**\nThe generated classes in the `DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Linq` namespace (e.g., `W`) are missing certain `XName` fields that were still present in previous versions of the SDK (e.g., 2.19.0). For example, the following fields are missing (among possibly others that I did not see):\n\n- `W.sdtPr`\n- `W.sdtEndPr`\n- `W.smartTag`\n- `W.tag`\n\n**To Reproduce**\nTo reproduce, just try to reference any of the above in your code.\n\n**Observed behavior**\n`XName` fields are suddenly no longer generated. \n\n**Expected behavior**\nAll relevant fields should be generated.\n\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\n - OS: any\n - Office version: any\n - .NET Target: any\n - DocumentFormat.OpenXml Version: 3.1.1\n\n**Additional context**\n3.1.1 is the first release after 3.x was first release that I am trying.

The conditional formatting should display icons based on the cell values as follows:\r\n•\tA green check mark for a value of 1\r\n•\tA red X for values greater than 1\r\n•\tNo icon for a value of 0\r\nAttempts Please include any attempts you have made to figure this out: I have attempted to implement this using the Open-XML-SDK, but I am having trouble with the correct setup of the ConditionalFormatting and ConditionalFormattingRule classes. \r\n\r\nRelated scenarios Any related documentation/samples/StackOverflow posts you have found: I have not found any specific examples or documentation that cover this exact scenario. Most examples I found are for basic conditional formatting without custom icons.\r\nAdditional context Add any other context about the problem here: I am using the Open-XML-SDK to generate Excel files programmatically.

This issue was not there when using OpenXML SDK 2.7.2 until upgraded OpenXML SDK to version 2.11~2.18.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41477903/201820560-2990a00b-c11b-4afa-acec-ac48af4d8af0.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Use following code, to generate a new pptx file.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic static SlideLayoutPart CreateSlideLayout(PackEngineContext packEngineContext, SlideLayoutPart sourceLayoutPart, PresentationDocument targetDoc, SlideMasterPart targetMasterPart, List<ImageCacheItem> imageCacheItems, PPTIdCounter pptIdCounter)\r\n{\r\n    SlideLayoutPart targetLayoutPart = targetMasterPart.AddNewPart<SlideLayoutPart>();\r\n    targetLayoutPart.FeedData(sourceLayoutPart);\r\n\r\n    if (targetMasterPart.IsRepeatNameOfSlideLayout(targetLayoutPart))\r\n    {\r\n        targetLayoutPart.SetNameofSlideLayout();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    targetLayoutPart.AddPart(targetMasterPart, targetDoc.PresentationPart.GetIdOfPart(targetMasterPart));\r\n\r\n    bool needCloneDiagramParts = (sourceLayoutPart.DiagramColorsParts != null && sourceLayoutPart.DiagramColorsParts.Count() > 0) ||\r\n                                  (sourceLayoutPart.DiagramDataParts != null && sourceLayoutPart.DiagramDataParts.Count() > 0);\r\n    bool needCloneChartParts = sourceLayoutPart.HasChart();\r\n    AddImageRelatedParts(sourceLayoutPart, sourceLayoutPart.SlideLayout.CommonSlideData, sourceLayoutPart.VmlDrawingParts,\r\n                 targetLayoutPart, imageCacheItems, needCloneDiagramParts, needCloneChartParts);\r\n    HandleOtherParts(packEngineContext, sourceLayoutPart, sourceLayoutPart.SlideLayout.CommonSlideData,\r\n                 targetDoc, targetLayoutPart, targetLayoutPart.SlideLayout.CommonSlideData);\r\n\r\n    SlideLayoutId newLayoutId = new SlideLayoutId();\r\n    newLayoutId.Id = pptIdCounter.GetNextSlideMasterLayoutId();\r\n    newLayoutId.RelationshipId = targetMasterPart.GetIdOfPart(targetLayoutPart);\r\n    targetMasterPart.SlideMaster.SlideLayoutIdList.Append(newLayoutId);\r\n    targetLayoutPart.SlideLayout.Save();\r\n\r\n    return targetLayoutPart;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Observed behavior**\r\nPowerPoint will pop up repair error message when opening the error.pptx.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNo repair prompt and slide layout would not be broken.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windows\r\n - Office version 16.0.15726.20202\r\n - .NET Target: .NET Core\r\n - DocumentFormat.OpenXml Version: 2.18.0\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n1. We compared the normal.pptx and error.pptx, then found the element order is different, if we manually change the element order, then PowerPoint can open the file successfully.\r\n3. The following code came from the directory &\\ppt\\slideMasters\\slideMaster1.xml, XML node in PPTX generated by openxml2.7.2 is as follows, the element AlternateContent was behind sldLayoutIdLst, and the document can be opened normally.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41477903/201821102-d6fa1fb1-38e7-40f2-899f-a184d31d4d15.png)\r\n\r\n4. In version 2.11~2.18 of OpenXML, the generated XML document changed to such that the \"AlternateContent\" and \"p:sldLayoutIdLst\" were reversed, causing this problem.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41477903/201821124-0e8f7a30-9625-4c3c-81e7-9ad5f580ed96.png)\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"5714730583","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2026-01-09T19:30:55","Actor":"mikeebowen","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"labeled","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1694","RelatedDescription":null,"RelatedBody":"**Description**\r\n\r\nThe `DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Office.SpreadSheetML` namespace should be changed to `DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Office.SpreadsheetML` (with lowercase s)\r\n\r\n**Information**\r\n\r\n- .NET Target: any\r\n- DocumentFormat.OpenXml Version: 2.15.0+\r\n\r\n**Expected**\r\n\r\nSpreadsheet should be one word.\r\n"},{"Id":"5713838571","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2026-01-09T18:44:14","Actor":"mikeebowen","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":null,"RelatedDescription":null,"RelatedBody":null},{"Id":"5662396142","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2026-01-07T18:40:53","Actor":"mikeebowen","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":null,"RelatedDescription":null,"RelatedBody":null},{"Id":"5661902524","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2026-01-07T18:20:30","Actor":"dependabot[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"labeled","RelatedUrl":null,"RelatedDescription":null,"RelatedBody":null},{"Id":"5661902516","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2026-01-07T18:20:30","Actor":"dependabot[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"labeled","RelatedUrl":null,"RelatedDescription":null,"RelatedBody":null},{"Id":"5661902336","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2026-01-07T18:20:29","Actor":"dependabot[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"labeled","RelatedUrl":null,"RelatedDescription":null,"RelatedBody":null},{"Id":"5661902332","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2026-01-07T18:20:29","Actor":"dependabot[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"labeled","RelatedUrl":null,"RelatedDescription":null,"RelatedBody":null},{"Id":"5661902013","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2026-01-07T18:20:29","Actor":"dependabot[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":null,"RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"\" (#1998) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":null},{"Id":"5639568988","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2026-01-06T20:17:14","Actor":"mikeebowen","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":null,"RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"\" (#1997) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":null},{"Id":"5639203470","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2026-01-06T19:56:09","Actor":"mikeebowen","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1990","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Inquiry About NuGet Package Release for v3.4.0\" (#1990) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Hi team,\n\nI noticed that version **3.4.0** of the Open XML SDK has been released as per the release notes, but the corresponding NuGet package does not yet appear to be published on nuget.org.\n\nCould you kindly share the expected timeline for the NuGet package release? \n\nThanks for your continued efforts on this valuable library!"},{"Id":"5639153722","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2026-01-06T19:53:15","Actor":"github-actions[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1996","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Approval for publishing to Nuget.org\" (#1996) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":">[!NOTE]\n> Workflow is pending manual review.\n> URL: https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/actions/runs/20759972485\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Required approvers: \n> * @twsouthwick\n> * @tomjebo\n> * @mikeebowen\n\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Respond \"approved\", \"approve\", \"lgtm\", \"yes\" to continue workflow or \"denied\", \"deny\", \"no\" to cancel."}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2026-01-10T03:30:23.7404681Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":764}

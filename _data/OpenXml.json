It means that when you refer to stackoverflow, you might as well refer to /dev/null. If the questions are answered, they answer by telling the users to use a library on top of the SDK, ie. the question is ignored.\r\n\r\nWhat I think is needed, is more samples. Otherwise, what is the point with the Open-XML-SDK, when it's easier to read the specification and not use the SDK?"},{"Id":"38144201486","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-05-07T01:30:38","Actor":"HanJason","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1709","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"When opening a pptx file, it prompts that there is a problem with the content and needs to be repaired.\" (#1709) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen opening a pptx file, it prompts that there is a problem with the content and needs to be repaired.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/assets/3375750/7493e3e3-e4dc-437f-b3bf-faaa29f488ac)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/assets/3375750/bde6b769-484b-4e48-a750-758c121ede76)\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nOnly insert a slide into the target file.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\nRun the program and open the output file\r\n\r\n**Observed behavior**\r\nPowerPoint found a problem with content in c:\\..\\bin\\Debug\\net6.0\\abc_copy.pptx.\r\nPowerPoint can attempt to repair the presentation.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nA clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: [Windows]\r\n - .NET Target: ( .NET Core NET6.0)\r\n - DocumentFormat.OpenXml Version: (2.20.0)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n```C#\r\nusing DocumentFormat.OpenXml;\r\nusing DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging;\r\nusing DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Presentation;\r\n\r\nvar pathfile = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory + \"abc.pptx\";\r\nvar destinationFilePath = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory + \"abc_copy.pptx\";\r\n\r\nusing (PresentationDocument sourcePresentation = PresentationDocument.Open(pathfile, false))\r\n{\r\n    using var mStream = new MemoryStream();\r\n    PresentationDocument destinationPresentation = PresentationDocument.Create(mStream, PresentationDocumentType.Presentation);\r\n\r\n    foreach (var part in sourcePresentation.Parts)\r\n    {\r\n        destinationPresentation.AddPart(part.OpenXmlPart, part.RelationshipId);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    PresentationPart?

But even though it exists, that exception gets thrown. If we catch, log, and ignore the exception, I can see that the part with that specific name doesn't exist anymore in `WorkbookPart.ChildrenRelationshipParts`. So it looks like it deletes it from there but that exception gets thrown, but unclear why.\n\nHere is the really weird thing that I notice when debugging in Visual Studio is that if I hit a breakpoint right before the `DeletePart()` call and hover over my `SpreadsheetDocument` object and look into `WorkbookPart.ChildrenRelationshipParts` property and enumerate results in VS, then continue code execution, that exception above doesn't get thrown and it deletes the part just fine. I even tried to enumerate programmatically over the `Parts` property to see if that'll \"pre-load\" anything, but no avail.

Specifically, this seems to be seen when docs have hyperlinks that are not valid URIs. This change adds a handler to rewrite this upon opening a document in case they exist. Subsequent user code can handle any other manipulation that is needed (such as removal of the offending hyperlink).\r\n\r\nFixes #715 "}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"PowerTools":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2020-08-18T05:30:42.5883803Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1067}

The problem I have is that no matter what I try for adding those controls it simply doesn't work. I even tried getting the code with Open XML Productivity Tool to see how they are added but that also didn't work, it added VmlDrawingsPart to the Excel file but the Check Boxes were not visible. Also i looked for documentation on how to add FormControls but was unsuccessful in finding it.

Lots of temporary allocations:\r\n1.1. StringWriter\r\n1.2. XmlDomTextWriter (which allocates a 6000 char buffer)\r\n1.3 Final string\r\n2. String comparison instead of comparing primitive types.\r\n\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nDue to the amount of allocations, we are seeing tons of garbage collection happening when creating Excel sheets in our service.\r\nWhen creating the sheets we have attach styles for the sheet, but to avoid re-adding styles, we compare them to previously added styles.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWould be nice if OpenXmlElement implemented IEquatable<T>.\r\nHowever, due to potential wishes for controlling ordering behaviour I could imagine someone wanting a more complex API, but I'm okay with any of them.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nTried to implement a faster comparison based on writing to a stream and comparing the underlying bytes instead.\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing (var ms0 = new MemoryStream(256))\r\nusing (var ms1 = new MemoryStream(256))\r\nusing (XmlWriter writer = XmlWriter.Create(ms0, xwSettings))\r\nusing (XmlWriter writer2 = XmlWriter.Create(ms0, xwSettings))\r\n{\r\n    font.WriteTo(writer);\r\n    font.WriteTo(writer2);\r\n\r\n    writer.Flush();\r\n    writer2.Flush();\r\n\r\n    if (ms0.Position == ms1.Position)\r\n    {\r\n        byte[] buf1 = ms0.GetBuffer();\r\n        byte[] buf2 = ms1.GetBuffer();\r\n\r\n        buf1.AsSpan(0, (int)ms0.Position).SequenceEqual(ms1.GetBuffer().AsSpan(0, (int)ms1.Position));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have also tried to do the above, but reusing the XmlWriter and MemoryStream, which reduces the allocations and time significantly. However [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4919210/reusing-xmltextwriter-class) warns of reuse.\r\nHowever a slightly naive attempt to recurse the children and attributes show there is more to gain. It could be even faster if the GetAttributes didn't allocate a new list.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nBenchmarks:\r\n```\r\nBenchmarkDotNet=v0.13.5, OS=Windows 10 (10.0.19045.3086/22H2/2022Update)\r\nAMD Ryzen 7 5800X, 1 CPU, 16 logical and 8 physical cores\r\n.NET SDK=7.0.304\r\n  [Host] : .NET 6.0.18 (6.0.1823.26907), X64 RyuJIT AVX2\r\n\r\nServer=True  \r\n\r\n|          Method | N |       Mean |     Error |   StdDev |   Gen0 |   Gen1 | Allocated |\r\n|---------------- |-- |-----------:|----------:|---------:|-------:|-------:|----------:|\r\n|              MS | 1 | 4,455.6 ns |  57.62 ns | 51.08 ns | 0.9537 | 0.0381 |   16024 B |\r\n|           Reuse | 1 | 2,732.4 ns |  12.43 ns | 11.02 ns | 0.0076 |      - |     144 B |\r\n|        OuterXML | 1 | 5,784.4 ns | 100.72 ns | 98.92 ns | 1.7548 | 0.0839 |   29424 B |\r\n| RecursiveManual | 1 |   974.1 ns |   3.62 ns |  3.21 ns | 0.0648 |      - |    1104 B |\r\n```\r\n"},{"Id":"30295283777","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-07-09T19:31:34","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1476","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Introduce equality comparers for OpenXmlElement\" (#1476) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Problem:\r\nThe current way to determine equality for two OpenXmlElements seems to\r\nbe x.OuterXml.Equals(y.OuterXml) (based on StackOverflow top answer).\r\n\r\nThis performs horribly due to allocation of strings and XmlWriter.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nThis PR introduces OpenXmlElementEqualityComparer which supports equality determination.\r\nFurthermore, the definition of equality is defined by OpenXmlElementEqualityOptions which allows for controlling how equality should be defined.\r\n\r\nBenchmark results comparing to x.OuterXml.Equals(y.OuterXml):\r\n```\r\nBenchmarkDotNet=v0.13.2, OS=Windows 10 (10.0.19045.3086)\r\nAMD Ryzen 7 5800X, 1 CPU, 16 logical and 8 physical cores\r\n.NET SDK=7.0.304\r\n  [Host] : .NET 7.0.7 (7.0.723.27404), X64 RyuJIT AVX2\r\n\r\nJob=InProcess  Toolchain=InProcessEmitToolchain\r\n\r\n|                       Method |              Mean |           Error |          StdDev |     Gen0 |     Gen1 |     Gen2 | Allocated |\r\n|----------------------------- |------------------:|----------------:|----------------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|----------:|\r\n|         OuterXmlLargeElement | 22,469,563.462 ns | 156,783.6460 ns | 130,921.4452 ns | 437.5000 | 281.2500 | 218.7500 | 7370176 B |\r\n|           EqualsLargeElement |  9,235,127.232 ns | 118,532.7404 ns | 105,076.1870 ns |        - |        - |        - |      10 B |\r\n| EqualsLargeElementSkipPrefix |  4,165,810.498 ns |  78,261.1757 ns |  76,862.9390 ns |        - |        - |        - |       5 B |\r\n|             UnparsedOuterXml |          3.296 ns |       0.0140 ns |       0.0131 ns |        - |        - |        - |         - |\r\n|               UnparsedEquals |          4.721 ns |       0.0149 ns |       0.0125 ns |        - |        - |        - |         - |\r\n|                SmallOuterXml |      3,616.694 ns |      52.6133 ns |      43.9345 ns |   1.7662 |   0.0877 |        - |   29584 B |\r\n|                  SmallEquals |        705.613 ns |       3.4249 ns |       3.2037 ns |   0.0010 |        - |        - |      24 B |\r\n|        SmallEqualsSkipPrefix |        376.926 ns |       3.3287 ns |       2.9508 ns |   0.0014 |        - |        - |      24 B |\r\n```"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2023-07-10T03:30:24.8082738Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":695}

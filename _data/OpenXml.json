As soon as I try and open the worksheets inside of the package (excelPackage.Workbook.Worksheets) my test uses ~ 400 MB of memory and takes around 20 seconds to finish that line of code. I am wondering if this is a normal amount of load for the tool to be using for a 30 MB .xlsx file with 3 worksheets. My larger issue is that the tool seems to be keeping around 1.2 GB of memory even after I am done with this ListWorksheets task. So a) 1.2 GB seems excessive for a 30 MB file and b) the memory should be deallocated when the tool is done with it should it not?"},{"Id":"13031035100","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-07-27T23:58:02","Actor":"no-response[bot]","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/issues/755","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Not able to add chart in spreadsheet\" (#755) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Am new to C# and OpenXML.

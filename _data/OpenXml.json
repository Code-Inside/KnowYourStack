So, in schematron.json the restriction becomes:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"Context\": \"w:name\",\r\n    \"Test\": \"matches(@w:val, \\u0022[^,]*\\u0022)\",\r\n    \"App\": \"Word\"\r\n},\r\n```\r\nrestricting the `w:name` property from containing commas for all elements in Word. \r\n\r\nThis may be a \"won't fix\", because it looks like it will either be a major rewrite of how that validation works that could involve breaking changes or creating separate classes for the different `w:name` elements, like `FieldMapDataName` and `CategoryName`, but this would definitely be a breaking change as they all currently use `DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing.Name` for this class. I'm adding the issue in the hope I'm wrong. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nAdd commas to the `w:val` property of a `w:name` element that is not the child of `w:fieldMapData` or `w:category` (e.g. `w:docPartPr` or `w:style`) then create an instance of the `OpenXmlValidator` and validate the file.\r\n\r\n**Observed behavior**\r\n\r\nThe validator returns an invalid value error for the `w:val` property.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nExpected the validation to pass without error.\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n\r\n - OS: Windows 11\r\n - Office version 16.0.16626.20086\r\n - .NET Target: .Net 8\r\n - DocumentFormat.OpenXml Version: 3.0.1\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis was discovered from a user issue with the ooxml-validator-vscode: https://github.com/mikeebowen/ooxml-validator-vscode/issues/25.\r\n"},{"Id":"35093151843","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-01-24T17:46:37","Actor":"mikeebowen","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/issues/204","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add SVG as ImagePartType for Office 2016 support\" (#204) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Hi,\r\n\r\nOffice 2016 now (finally) supports svg as a vector image format (https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/Insert-SVG-images-in-Microsoft-Office-69f29d39-194a-4072-8c35-dbe5e7ea528c)\r\nAs far as I can see the OpenXml SDK does not currently have support for this yet (as ImagePartType for example).\r\nAre there any plans of adding it in the future, or any roadblocks that might inhibit implementing it?"},{"Id":"35040811158","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-01-23T08:17:14","Actor":"ppiredda","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1654","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Open XML create image from excel range\" (#1654) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"### Discussed in https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/discussions/1653\r\n\r\n<div type='discussions-op-text'>\r\n\r\n<sup>Originally posted by **ppiredda** January 23, 2024</sup>\r\nHi all, sorry but i have this problem: I create an Excel file and after that I need to collect row and columns (range) and create an image in order to send it to the clients.

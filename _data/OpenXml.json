Are you also working with the relevant team to get this upgraded?\r\n\r\nAlso, is there an easy way to suppress this compiler error? I have tried a few options as identified in this article - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10608309/disabling-obsolete-error-in-c-sharp. It seems like the only option available to us is to access this property through reflection? Without an easy way to suppress this compiler error, it almost breaks semver conventions and requires a bump to the major version.\r\n\r\nI think, without having a suitable alternative, it's probably too soon to set this as a compiler error.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @markholst in https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/discussions/1414#discussioncomment-6191287_"},{"Id":"30174136109","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-07-04T01:54:45","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1486","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Add generated files check\" (#1486) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"30170891486","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-07-03T20:46:41","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1486","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Add generated files check\" (#1486) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2023-07-04T03:30:24.0590621Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":672}

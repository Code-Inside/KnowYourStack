Defines a `GetImagePartType` method given an associated file extension string.\r\n2. Overloads `AddImagePart` with a version that takes the file extension string and adds the `ImagePart` using the native method, but retrieving the `ImagePartType` via the above method.\r\n\r\nIf there is a better place / approach for this feature, please let me know so that I have a better grasp on where to accomplish similar features in the future should they arise.

It means that when you refer us to stackoverflow, most of the time you might as well refer to /dev/null. If the questions are answered, they answer by telling the users to use a library on top of the SDK, ie. the question is ignored.\r\n\r\nAnother example is how to reuse the same embeded workbook for several different charts in a presentation. Does that work? Or must the workbook stream be re-read for each chart? Etc.\r\n\r\nAlso the API reference on microsofts site contains no example code and it's \"learn\" section is sorely lacking.\r\n\r\nWhat I think is needed, is more samples. Otherwise, what is the point with the Open-XML-SDK, when it's easier to read the specification and not use the SDK?"},{"Id":"38337649400","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-05-13T20:45:32","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1717","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Add a request for documentation when creating an issue\" (#1717) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Fixes #1710"},{"Id":"38337513035","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-05-13T20:40:18","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1717","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Add a request for documentation when creating an issue\" (#1717) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Fixes #1710"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2024-05-14T03:30:19.6286627Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":644}

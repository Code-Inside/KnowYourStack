This was because the\r\nconstraint was generating the cached lookup with a key using the\r\nattribute text itself. This change updates the lookup to cache all\r\npossible duplicates for the element in question so it only has to be\r\nsearched once.\r\n\r\nFixes #918 "},{"Id":"16031601768","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-04-21T15:32:29","Actor":"g136660","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/issues/923","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Is it possible to split a document page by page into files?

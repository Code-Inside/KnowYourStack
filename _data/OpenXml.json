This only occurs in v3.0 or higher. In addition to the temp files being created in the user temp folder which is new, Dispose() does not clear the temp files. So if the app is reading a large amount of spreadsheets, it eventually causes significant HDD capacity to be used.\r\n\r\nDowngrading back to v2.20.0 resolves the issue\r\n\r\n"},{"Id":"36069169699","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-02-28T00:00:26","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1677","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Ensure temp files are non-shareable and delete on close\" (#1677) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Fixes #1658\r\n"},{"Id":"36069163805","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2024-02-28T00:00:08","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1674","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Bump xunit from 2.6.6 to 2.7.0\" (#1674) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Bumps [xunit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit) from 2.6.6 to 2.7.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/xunit/xunit/commit/d806fa137a69112242ecf075b8dd6c65b322c197\"><code>d806fa1</code></a> v2.7.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/xunit/xunit/commit/13bb60be3604244c234d304ef7f82657b7a710f6\"><code>13bb60b</code></a> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2872\">#2872</a>: Expand special handling for sets in Assert.Contains/DoesNotContain (v2)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/xunit/xunit/commit/203b4d91c63c14023e61cffde4ec58364d540fb2\"><code>203b4d9</code></a> Update to use the common build system (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2883\">#2883</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/xunit/xunit/commit/a4f585b9e44ca6dcd2d1607ce4ef1547047d6ad9\"><code>a4f585b</code></a> Remove UTF-8 byte order marks</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/xunit/xunit/commit/8b2c7b2c204b2c3eec6ef6102e8f448c212d4c26\"><code>8b2c7b2</code></a> Add v3 build submodule</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/xunit/xunit/commit/2413c5797c378d25bbfa38aa63d5a676d317debf\"><code>2413c57</code></a> Throw when user tries to run a non-async test with a timeout</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/xunit/xunit/commit/9ebc10c86170e6dc40a41cfcf05ee23a9fc260cd\"><code>9ebc10c</code></a> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2573\">#2573</a>: Opting out of AsyncTestSyncContext (v2)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/xunit/xunit/commit/b060404f65904e59372ec4e5bfe5260b39db7ded\"><code>b060404</code></a> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2880\">xunit/xunit#2880</a>: Update XML documentation for string-based Assert.Equal (v2)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/xunit/xunit/commit/6bbf922aa572120d99a7e8dd90de52e8cbf5dadb\"><code>6bbf922</code></a> Add conditions to EquivalenceAssertsTests for XUNIT_IMMUTABLE_COLLECTIONS</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/xunit/xunit/commit/cab6a3e275d3bd4ed4d567110079e2133bac2fc4\"><code>cab6a3e</code></a> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/xunit/xunit/issues/2871\">#2871</a>: Inner exception stack trace is missing from Assert.Collection failure ...</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/xunit/xunit/compare/2.6.6...2.7.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=xunit&package-manager=nuget&previous-version=2.6.6&new-version=2.7.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

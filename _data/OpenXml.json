issue \"Reader depth or how to get current node real depth.\" (#803) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Is there any approach to get `depth`, `lineNumber` or `position` of current node in a real XML file?\r\nAs it's done using native `XmlTextReader`: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.xml.xmltextreader.lineposition?view=netcore-3.1\r\n```csharp\r\nwhile (reader.Read()){\r\n       switch (reader.NodeType){\r\n         case XmlNodeType.Element:\r\n           Console.Write(\"{0} {1},{2}  \", reader.Depth, reader.LineNumber, reader.LinePosition);\r\n           Console.WriteLine(\"<{0}>\", reader.Name);\r\n           break;\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have tried to get `Depth` of OpenXMLReader, but it seems that it is returning depth of element in some stack which is not real depth of current xml node.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have such functionality.\r\n"},{"Id":"13437036421","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-09-07T15:15:58","Actor":"mattiamerzi","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/802","RelatedDescription":"Opened

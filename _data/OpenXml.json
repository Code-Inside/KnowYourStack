The problem I have is that no matter what I try for adding those controls it simply doesn't work. I even tried getting the code with Open XML Productivity Tool to see how they are added but that also didn't work, it added VmlDrawingsPart to the Excel file but the Check Boxes were not visible. Also i looked for documentation on how to add FormControls but was unsuccessful in finding it.  So I was wondering if it is even possible to add Controls to excel file using Open XML and if it is could you help me with code or documentation on how to do it.\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n"},{"Id":"29778668982","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-06-15T12:06:12","Actor":"bo12l","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1449","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Help with adding Form Controls to Excel file using Open XML C#.\" (#1449) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Hi there,\r\nI am using Open XML SDK in one of the projects I am currently working on to create Excel file that would need to have Check boxes(Form Controls not ActiveX controls) in some of the cells.

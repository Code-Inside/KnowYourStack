However internally excel uses the invariant/US-culture.\r\n\r\nSo if you add a value to cell A1 like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// a value\r\ndouble value = 0.5;\r\n//assume sheet, row, are created\r\nrow.AppendChild(new Cell { CellReference = \"A1\", CellValue = new CellValue(value), DataType = new EnumValue<CellValues>(CellValues.Number)});\r\n```\r\nExcel will accept the file if the code above is executed in a thread running on US culture. If running on a thread that uses ',' as a decimal seperator, excel will give the \"We found a problem witn some content...\" warning.\r\nIf you examine the value in the zip file it will be \"0,5\" (not 0.5 as is required).\r\n\r\nI have not found a work around other than forcing the the thread to use US culture.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that the culture settings of excel do not matter, it is the generation of the xlsx that is wrong.

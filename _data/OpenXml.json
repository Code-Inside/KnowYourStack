We then clone a specified range (approximately 50 rows) from the template to the target Excel using CloneNode(true), preserving all cell styles and values within this range. Based on the data volume, we paginate the content, cloning from the template for each new page.\n\nEach cloning operation takes over 30 milliseconds. With 2000 pages of data in total, this results in more than one minute of processing time. The current performance is considered unacceptable. Are there any more efficient approaches?\n\n`(Row)sourceRow.CloneNode(true);   // Each invocation of this method consumes roughly 2ms.`"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2025-09-13T03:30:20.424835Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":499}

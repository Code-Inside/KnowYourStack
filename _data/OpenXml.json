The main benefit of this change is it removes reliance on all inner workings on the namespace id. This was a hard coded value that was essentially a magic number for each namespace. This replaces that with a struct that handles the comparisons (`OpenXmlNamespace`) as well as a type that wraps that to identify a qualified name (`OpenXmlQualifiedName`). This change also makes it clear where a string is a name, a namespace, a prefix, etc.\r\n\r\nThis does not update the generated files to not use namespace ids. That is still in place, but is the last place where a namespace id is needed."},{"Id":"14809355396","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-01-13T18:16:18","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/855","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Remove NsAnyParticle\" (#855) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"This isn't used and can be removed"},{"Id":"14802162564","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-01-13T08:36:09","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/855","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Remove NsAnyParticle\" (#855) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"This isn't used and can be removed"},{"Id":"14799935518","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-01-13T03:39:13","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/854","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Enable nullable references on OpenXmlContainer\" (#854) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"},"PowerTools":{"Events":[],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2021-01-20T05:30:41.8266076Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1162}

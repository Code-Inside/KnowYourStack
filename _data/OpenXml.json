issue \"SAX Approach Replace Example\" (#566) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"I'm looking for an example of using the SAX approach (instead of DOM) to open a large file and perform a replace on a given value, then save the file.\r\n\r\nI think this would be a useful addition to the [Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/open-xml/open-xml-sdk).\r\n\r\nHow to: Search and replace text in a document part (Open XML SDK)\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/open-xml/how-to-search-and-replace-text-in-a-document-part\r\n\r\nThis uses a `Stream`.\r\n\r\nHow to: Parse and read a large spreadsheet document (Open XML SDK)\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/open-xml/how-to-parse-and-read-a-large-spreadsheet\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// The SAX approach.\r\nstatic void ReadExcelFileSAX(string fileName)\r\n{\r\n    using (SpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(fileName, false))\r\n    {\r\n        WorkbookPart workbookPart = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart;\r\n        WorksheetPart worksheetPart = workbookPart.WorksheetParts.First();\r\n\r\n        OpenXmlReader reader = OpenXmlReader.Create(worksheetPart);\r\n        string text;\r\n        while (reader.Read())\r\n        {\r\n            if (reader.ElementType == typeof(CellValue))\r\n            {\r\n                text = reader.GetText();\r\n                Console.Write(text + \" \");\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        Console.WriteLine();\r\n        Console.ReadKey();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf I read in the \"text\" and wish to replace this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing (WordprocessingDocument wordDoc = WordprocessingDocument.Open(filePath, true))\r\n{\r\n    Document document = wordDoc.MainDocumentPart.Document;\r\n    OpenXmlReader reader = OpenXmlReader.Create(document);\r\n    while (reader.Read())\r\n    {\r\n        //OpenXmlElement element = reader.LoadCurrentElement();\r\n        //text = element.InnerText;\r\n        text = reader.GetText();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`OpenXmlWriter` expects an `OpenXmlPart` or `Stream` when you create it.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nOpenXmlWriter writer = OpenXmlWriter.Create(#);\r\nwriter.WriteStartElement(reader);\r\nwriter.WriteElement(#);\r\nwriter.WriteEndElement();\r\nwriter.Close();\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is the supported approach/method for this?\r\n\r\nUsing the DOM approach on large files can cause memory exceptions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere are a number of blog posts documenting how to use the `OpenXmlWriter` but this is for creating new files or adding new elements to an existing file, not updating existing data.\r\n\r\n**Parsing and Reading Large Excel Files with the Open XML

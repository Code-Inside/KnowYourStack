With the move to using source generators, this is not the case and is not straightforward with the current data structure.\r\n\r\nThe direction to investigate here would be:\r\n\r\n- Create a lookup in OpenXmlGeneratorServices that would search the types given `SchemaType.BaseClass`\r\n- Update the backend to not use a class name in `SchemaType.BaseClass` but rather a QName\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @twsouthwick in https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1345#issuecomment-1459157916_\r\n            "},{"Id":"27541547768","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-03-07T08:54:57","Actor":"lindexi","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1355","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Open document fail when Content_Types records paths with wrong case\" (#1355) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nThe `PresentationDocument.Open` will throw the OpenXmlPackageException exception when we open the document which Content_Types records paths with wrong case.\r\n\r\n```\r\nDocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.OpenXmlPackageException:“The document cannot be opened because there is an invalid part with an unexpected content type. \r\n[Part Uri=/ppt/presProps.xml], \r\n[Content Type=application/xml], \r\n[Expected Content Type=application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presProps+xml].”\r\n\r\nDocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.OpenXmlPart.Load(DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.OpenXmlPackage, DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.OpenXmlPart, System.Uri, string, System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<System.Uri, DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.OpenXmlPart>)\r\n    DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.OpenXmlPartContainer.LoadReferencedPartsAndRelationships(DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.OpenXmlPackage, DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.OpenXmlPart, DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.RelationshipCollection, System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<System.Uri, DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.OpenXmlPart>)\r\n    DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.OpenXmlPartContainer.LoadReferencedPartsAndRelationships(DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.OpenXmlPackage, DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.OpenXmlPart, DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.RelationshipCollection, System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary<System.Uri, DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.OpenXmlPart>)\r\n    DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.OpenXmlPackage.Load(System.IO.Packaging.Package)\r\n    DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.PresentationDocument.Open(System.IO.Stream, bool, DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging.OpenSettings)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `[Content_Types].xml` records the PartName with wrong case, such as `/ppt/presprops.xml` what we expect is `/ppt/presProps.xml`.\r\n\r\nAnd we can open the document with Office PowerPoint, but fail with OpenXMLSDK.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n// Please add a self-contained, minimum viable repro of the issue.\r\n// If you require external resources, please provide a gist or GitHub repro\r\n// An Xunit style test is preferred, but a console application would work too.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Download the [test file](https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/files/10907289/Content_Types.Path.case.pptx) \r\n2.

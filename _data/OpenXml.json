I have read rows from excel as you suggested, also I added a method reading with cell index because when a cell is null, it was sliding. \r\n\r\nI keep the inner text from the cell if the cell has a datatype\r\n\r\n`    \r\nstring value = cell?.InnerText;\r\n\r\ncase CellValues.SharedString:\r\n               value = stringTablePart.SharedStringTable.ChildElements[Int32.Parse(value)].InnerText?.Trim();\r\n               break;\r\n\r\nreturn value;\r\n`\r\n I get the value like that, everything is ok except price. It changes the signs. firstly removes all dots, then replaces the comma to dot \r\nex1. value from excel 1.200.000,50 -> reads like 12000000.5\r\n\r\nso dot and comma comes from culture number seperator settings, culture and cultureUI and current thread culture and ui set as tr-TR because tr culture has . for group seperator and comma for decimal seperator. \r\n\r\nWhy is this excel reading like that?\r\n\r\n**Information**\r\n\r\n- .NET Target: (.Net 5)\r\n- DocumentFormat.OpenXml Version: (ie 2.13.0)\r\n\r\n**Repro**\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// Please add a self-contained, minimum viable repro of the issue.\r\n// If you require external resources, please provide a gist or GitHub repro\r\n// An Xunit style test is preferred, but a console application would work too.\r\n``` \r\n\r\n**Observed**\r\n\r\nvalue saved in excel 1.500,70\r\nread like 1500.7\r\n\r\n**Expected**\r\n\r\nit should read the same as how is written. Because the convert working with culture settings, this is a string value and I will parse this to decimal. (1500.7) this is converted as (15007) because . is group separetor.\r\n\r\nPlease add your expected behavior here.\r\n"}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2022-05-05T03:30:26.0094289Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":562}

When values, such as true or false, are present for an xml attribute for this type, the `Value` property of the `EnumValue<OnOffOnlyType>` object throws a `System.FormatException` exception.\r\n\r\nThe attached document contains an element `/document[0]/tbl[0]/tr[0]/trPr[0]/cantSplit` which contains the property in question.\r\n[file-sample_500kB.docx](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/files/4953640/file-sample_500kB.docx)\r\n\r\nI'm open to discuss this further but it doesn't seem like this should be the correct behavior.\r\n\r\n**Information**\r\n\r\n- .NET Target: .NET Framework 4.7.2\r\n- DocumentFormat.OpenXml Version: 2.11.3\r\n\r\n**Repro**\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging;\r\nusing DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing;\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.IO;\r\nusing System.Linq;\r\n\r\nnamespace ConsoleApp2\r\n{\r\n    class Program\r\n    {\r\n        static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            // Change  to path of test file\r\n            const string pathToFile = @\"C:\\path\\to\\file-sample_500kB.docx\";\r\n\r\n            using (var f = new FileStream(pathToFile, FileMode.Open))\r\n            {\r\n                using (var docx = WordprocessingDocument.Open(f, false))\r\n                {\r\n                    var sample = docx.MainDocumentPart.Document.Descendants<CantSplit>().FirstOrDefault();\r\n\r\n                    if (sample != null)\r\n                    {\r\n                        var val = sample.Val;\r\n                        Console.WriteLine($\"Sample has value: {val.HasValue}\");\r\n                        Console.WriteLine($\"Sample inner text: {val.InnerText}\");\r\n\r\n                        try\r\n                        {\r\n                            Console.WriteLine($\"Sample value: {val.Value}\");\r\n                        }\r\n                        catch (Exception x)\r\n                        {\r\n                            Console.WriteLine($\"Sample value threw {x.GetType().Name}\");\r\n                            Console.WriteLine($\"Sample value exception message: {x.Message}\");\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Press any key to quit\");\r\n            Console.ReadKey(true);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\r\n**Observed**\r\n\r\n```\r\nSample has value: False\r\nSample inner text: false\r\nSample value threw FormatException\r\nSample value exception message: The text value is not a valid enumeration value.\r\nPress any key to quit\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected**\r\n\r\n```\r\nSample has value: True\r\nSample inner text: false\r\nSample value: DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing.OnOffOnlyValues.False or DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing.OnOffOnlyValues.Off\r\nPress any key to quit\r\n```\r\n"},{"Id":"12966773911","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-07-21T01:28:33","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/776","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Add more projects to Related Tools\" (#776) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"12966119435","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2020-07-20T23:58:31","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/778","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"Use WindowsBase instead of package on .NET Framework\" (#778) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Currently we're using System.IO.Packaging NuGet package on .NET 4.6+,\r\nwhen this isn't really necessary.

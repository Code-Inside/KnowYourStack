If the string returned by the ToString() method is to be written to an XML file, its String.ToLowerInvariant method should be called first to convert it to lowercase."},{"Id":"19156996518","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-12-02T18:40:30","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1074","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"No symbols package on nuget.org for v2.14.0\" (#1074) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Ref #639 - this seems to have regressed because there is no option on nuget.org to download symbols for version 2.14.0."},{"Id":"19156567736","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-12-02T18:11:17","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1086","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Remove internals to backend\" (#1086) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"19156279403","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-12-02T17:52:20","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1085","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Set additional libraries as shipping\" (#1085) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"19156276519","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2021-12-02T17:52:10","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1063","RelatedDescription":"Closed pull request \"Use multiple PublicAPI.Shipped.txt files\" (#1063) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"A recent update to the PublicAPI allows to merge multiple files into a single data source.

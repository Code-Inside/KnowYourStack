So, in schematron.json the restriction becomes:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"Context\": \"w:name\",\r\n    \"Test\": \"matches(@w:val, \\u0022[^,]*\\u0022)\",\r\n    \"App\": \"Word\"\r\n},\r\n```\r\nrestricting the `w:name` property from containing commas for all elements in Word. \r\n\r\nThis may be a \"won't fix\", because it looks like it will either be a major rewrite of how that validation works that could involve breaking changes or creating separate classes for the different `w:name` elements, like `FieldMapDataName` and `CategoryName`, but this would definitely be a breaking change as they all currently use `DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Wordprocessing.Name` for this class.

The first process creates a summary.\nA the end, I merge all the documents and I would like to update the summary post-merge with all the new titles and pages.\n\nAs far as I know, there is no such functionality in the API.\nI also tried to go through the merged document and to search for titles and corresponding pages, but I cannot get the page number (I cannot a function that does that).\nAny suggestions? Any help? Thank you!!!\n\n(Putting in macros does not help, because the final output is a .pdf file.)\n"},{"Id":"47255736093","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-03-06T06:16:13","Actor":"adrianm64","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1886","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Can't open excel workbooks on one machine\" (#1886) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"47247045488","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-03-05T23:17:09","Actor":"github-actions[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"closed","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1888","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Manual approval required for workflow run 13686306246: Approval for publishing to Nuget.org\" (#1888) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Please approve or deny the deployment to Nuget.org\n\nWorkflow is pending manual review.\nURL: https://api.github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/actions/runs/13686306246\n\nRequired approvers: [twsouthwick tomjebo mikeebowen]\n\nRespond \"approved\", \"approve\", \"lgtm\", \"yes\" to continue workflow or \"denied\", \"deny\", \"no\" to cancel."},{"Id":"47246990448","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-03-05T23:14:44","Actor":"mikeebowen","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1887","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Update CHANGELOG.md for 3.3\" (#1887) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"47244986766","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-03-05T21:56:13","Actor":"github-actions[bot]","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1888","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Manual approval required for workflow run 13686306246: Approval for publishing to Nuget.org\" (#1888) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"Please approve or deny the deployment to Nuget.org\n\nWorkflow is pending manual review.\nURL: https://api.github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/actions/runs/13686306246\n\nRequired approvers: [twsouthwick tomjebo mikeebowen]\n\nRespond \"approved\", \"approve\", \"lgtm\", \"yes\" to continue workflow or \"denied\", \"deny\", \"no\" to cancel."},{"Id":"47244484095","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-03-05T21:39:12","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1887","RelatedDescription":"Opened pull request \"Update CHANGELOG.md for 3.3\" (#1887) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""},{"Id":"47216332239","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2025-03-05T09:16:18","Actor":"adrianm64","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1886","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Can't open excel workbooks on one machine\" (#1886) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"**Describe the bug**\n\nOn one machine the following code fails for all excel workbooks.\n\n```\nusing var stream = new FileStream(...);\nusing var document = SpreadsheetDocument.Open(stream, isEditable: true);\nDebug.Assert(document.WorkbookPart != null);\n```\nSame code and workbooks work fine on other machines.\nEven an empty workbook like this fails:\n[Blankreport.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19085726/Blankreport.xlsx)\n\n**Observed behavior**\ndocument.WorkbookPart is null.

The fix supported \".tif\" by mapping it to \".tiff\" extension.\r\n\r\nThis is not the right way of doing it. \".tif\" should be independently supported, because some organizations may want to only support one of these extensions to reduce complexity (despite the TIFF standard fully supports both extensions).\r\n\r\nThis new PR fully creates \".tif\" as an independent ImagePartType alongside \".tiff\".\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds JPEG-2000 ImagePartType extension \".jp2\". Many archives accept JPEG-2000 and TIFF images for long-term preservation.\r\n\r\nI try to PR into main, because it is a small fix, that does not break anything or change anything significantly, and I don't really know which other branch to PR into.\r\n\r\nPS. I had to close another malformed PR and fork the repo anew, to do this properly, to cancel out the 1304 unintended recommit, which I had put into my own main instead of a branch, when I did that awhile ago."},{"Id":"28737760315","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-04-28T17:51:44","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1424","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Remove ImagePartTypeInfo\" (#1424) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"In a recent change @tomjebo made, we consolidated many of the methods for adding parts.

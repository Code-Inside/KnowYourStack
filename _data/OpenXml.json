This is done in a way that will not break the current set up by defining type forwards from `DocumentFormat.OpenXml` to the new `DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Framework` assembly. This is a WIP and updates will be pushed to the PR as progress is made. The change is expected to be made before 2.18.0 and is a precursor to any changes to separate out by document type (word/excel/powerpoint)."},{"Id":"22421129660","Type":"PullRequestEvent","CreatedAt":"2022-06-20T03:23:25","Actor":"twsouthwick","Repository":"OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"OfficeDev","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"merged","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK/pull/1163","RelatedDescription":"Merged pull request \"Remove typed services from DefaultFeatures\" (#1163) at OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":""}],"ResultType":"GitHubEvent"}},"RunOn":"2022-06-21T03:30:25.7328125Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":604}

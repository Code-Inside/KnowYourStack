The reason is that in reference to the ZIP Appnote (ZIP File Format Specification Version 6.2.0) and the listed \"Requirements on package implementers\" in chapter B.4 are not met. What I would like to challenge in particular is the set \"General purpose bit flag\" of the ZIP local file header.  The currently used bit flag is utilizing bit 11, which is unsupported. \r\n\r\nFollowing references are hex representations of the XLSX file...\r\nOpenXML SDK used incorrect local file header: 50 4B 03 04 14 00 00 **_08_** 08 00\r\nMicrosoft Excel used correct file header:            50 4B 03 04 14 00 **_06_** 00 08 00\r\n\r\nSo Microsoft Excel by defaults seems to use \"super fast compression\" method by default with bit1 and bit2 toggled.\r\n\r\nCheck out for your reference\r\nhttps://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c077818_ISO_IEC_29500-2_2021(E).zip\r\nhttp://www.pkware.com/documents/APPNOTE/APPNOTE_6.2.0.txt\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```\r\nusing System.IO.Packaging;\r\nusing DocumentFormat.OpenXml;\r\nusing DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Packaging;\r\nusing DocumentFormat.OpenXml.Spreadsheet;\r\n\r\nCreateSpreadsheetWorkbook(\"C:\\\\Temp\\\\test.xlsx\");\r\n\r\nvoid CreateSpreadsheetWorkbook(string filepath)\r\n{\r\n\t// Create a spreadsheet document by supplying the filepath.\r\n\t// By default, AutoSave = true, Editable = true, and Type = xlsx.\r\n\tSpreadsheetDocument spreadsheetDocument = SpreadsheetDocument.\r\n\t\tCreate(filepath, SpreadsheetDocumentType.Workbook);\r\n\tspreadsheetDocument.CompressionOption = CompressionOption.SuperFast;\r\n\r\n\t// Add a WorkbookPart to the document.\r\n\tWorkbookPart workbookpart = spreadsheetDocument.AddWorkbookPart();\r\n\tworkbookpart.Workbook = new Workbook();\r\n\r\n\t// Add a WorksheetPart to the WorkbookPart.\r\n\tWorksheetPart worksheetPart = workbookpart.AddNewPart<WorksheetPart>();\r\n\tworksheetPart.Worksheet = new Worksheet(new SheetData());\r\n\r\n\t// Add Sheets to the Workbook.\r\n\tSheets sheets = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart!.Workbook.\r\n\t\tAppendChild<Sheets>(new Sheets());\r\n\r\n\t// Append a new worksheet and associate it with the workbook.\r\n\tSheet sheet = new Sheet() { Id = spreadsheetDocument.WorkbookPart.\r\n\t\tGetIdOfPart(worksheetPart), SheetId = 1, Name = \"mySheet\" };\r\n\tsheets.Append(sheet);\r\n\r\n\tworkbookpart.Workbook.Save();\r\n\r\n\t// Close the document.\r\n\tspreadsheetDocument.Dispose();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Create an empty excel spreadsheet and store it in XLSX\r\n2. Check with your favorite HEX file viewer the corresponding local file header\r\n4. See that the general purpose flag is set to a unsupported \"general purpose bit flag\", where bit 11 is toggled\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nOpenXML SDK should be compliant to the definitions of ISO_IEC_29500-2. The chosen CompressionOption in the C# code should be correctly considered for the \"general purpose bit flag\".\r\n\r\n**Desktop (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Windows\r\n - Office version 16.0.1398.20008\r\n - .NET Target: .NET Core 6\r\n - DocumentFormat.OpenXml Version: 2.20.0)\r\n"},{"Id":"29551356934","Type":"IssuesEvent","CreatedAt":"2023-06-06T04:47:49","Actor":"farzonl","Repository":"dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","Organization":"dotnet","RawContent":null,"RelatedAction":"opened","RelatedUrl":"https://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/issues/1442","RelatedDescription":"Opened issue \"Update OpenXML MS documentation\" (#1442) at dotnet/Open-XML-SDK","RelatedBody":"**Describe the bug**\r\nAfter this commit a number of APIs were removed:\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/commit/4260711d6234f078b24c26d26eb17205532901d5\r\nFor example\r\n`GetPartsCountOfType` was removed but the documentation doesn't indicated deprectated or removed in the applies to section.\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/documentformat.openxml.packaging.openxmlpartcontainer.getpartscountoftype?view=openxml-2.8.1\r\n\r\ninfact the documentation hasn't been updated since 2.8.1 and these apis lived on through 2.20.0\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/Open-XML-SDK/compare/v2.20.0...v3.0.0-beta1.patch\r\n\r\nThis is particularly unpleasant because the example code in the documentation is also incorrect: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/open-xml/how-to-insert-a-comment-into-a-word-processing-document\r\n\r\nIt does appear the documentation is hosted on github.

Period.\n------------------------------\n\nThe old `bg-opacity-50` system:\n\n*   ✅ Worked everywhere (even IE11 with polyfills)\n*   ✅ Was easy to override\n*   ✅ Didn’t rely on CSS features from 2022+\n*   ✅ Used a simple and elegant abstraction with `--tw-bg-opacity`\n\nNow we get:\n\n    <div class=\"bg-red-500/50\"></div>\n\nWhich:\n*   ❌ **Uses very recent color-mix function**\n*   ❌ **Breaks in older browsers**\n*   ❌ **Breaks in hybrid WEBVIEW**\n*   ❌ **Breaks in production when you least expect it**\n\nAll to save… what? One line of CSS? Was `rgba(var(--tw-bg-opacity))` too scary now?\n\n💡 You Could've Just Kept Both\n------------------------------\n\nTailwind has utilities like `text-decoration-skip-ink`, `sr-only`, and `accent-color`. Why was **`bg-opacity-*`**, one of the most basic and widely used utilities, the one chosen for removal?\n\nAt the very least, can we get:\n\n*   An **official plugin** to reintroduce `bg-opacity-*`\n*   Or an **opt-in flag** to restore legacy opacity handling\n*   Or a **clear migration guide** for developers with backward compatibility needs\n\n🔥 Devs in the Real World\n-------------------------\n\nNot all of us are building greenfield apps with evergreen browser audiences.

I would expect the [`@source` directive would pick up](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/detecting-classes-in-source-files#explicitly-registering-sources) to pick up classes from these elements and apply them to the generated stylesheets.\n\nThe classes are not picked up or added to the stylesheet.\n\nOddly enough, it looks like the color is being generated correctly, but the utility isn't:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/593e8b9f-fa32-4d75-9298-d1f6f2090d33)\n\nOn build, the color and utility are generated, so in theory I could scope these to the element's shadow myself:\n\n```\n@layer components;\n@layer utilities {\n  .static {\n    position: static;\n  }\n  .p-4 {\n    padding: calc(var(--spacing) * 4);\n  }\n  .text-blue-500 {\n    color: var(--color-blue-500);\n  }\n  .text-red-400 {\n    color: var(--color-red-400);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIs this a web components / shadow dom issue? Probably. But I was under the assumption that the `@source` directive would pick up these classes and then I could handle scoping them correctly.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18186","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"`@source` detection not working in a web components monorepo\" (#18186)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-06-06T03:30:23.6046636Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":492}

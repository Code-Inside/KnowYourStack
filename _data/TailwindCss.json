The text-shadow with CSS variables renders correctly both in development and after build.\n\nThe bug apparently occurs when using `@media` with `theme()` inside a CSS block.\n\nCauses the bug:\n```css\n@media (width <= theme('screens.lg')) {\n  .logo {\n    --stroke: var(--width);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWorks fine::\n```css\n@media (width <= var(--breakpoint-lg)) {\n  .logo {\n    --stroke: var(--width);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIt seems that using theme() directly inside a media query might break CSS parsing or value resolution during the build process (especially when combined with other custom properties).","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17615","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Nuxt build breaks CSS with when using `@media (width <= theme('screen.lg'))`\" (#17615)"},{"Id":"2981010848","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-08T21:39:32","Actor":"tremby","Number":"17614","RawContent":null,"Title":"Hyphenated custom container sizes aren't handled properly","State":"open","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\nv4.1.3\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nTailwind Play\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nTailwind Play\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nn/a\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nn/a\n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\nhttps://play.tailwindcss.com/OFXbKDyZ5G\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nIt seems hyphenated custom theme properties are supposed to be supported, like in the example the `--color-nice-blue` works just fine with a `bg-nice-blue`.\n\nBut if I try the same with a custom container size I get broken behaviour.\n\nIf I set `--container-custom`, I can apply `@custom:font-bold` and I see it render bold (since we're wider than the specified 2rem). In Tailwind Play's autocomplete, when I type `@cus` I see `@custom:` and `@max-custom:` and `@min-custom:`. This is all as expected.\n\nBut if I set `--container-hyphenated-custom`, the same doesn't work, and I don't see it render bold. In the autocomplete, interestingly, I see `@max-hyphenated-custom:` and `@min-hyphenated-custom:`, but no `@hyphenated-custom:`.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17614","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Hyphenated custom container sizes aren't handled properly\" (#17614)"},{"Id":"2980953995","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-08T21:11:28","Actor":"andymerskin","Number":"17612","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4.1.3] Saved changes not reflected between hot-reloads / refreshes","State":"open","Body":"I'm not sure if this is directly [related to this PR](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17554), but after updating to Tailwind v4.1.3 which includes this change, I'm still not seeing changes reflected on each hot reload (but sometimes it works!), forcing me to restart my dev server for simple className changes in any context. For some reason Tailwind isn't picking up on new utilities being used. I haven't fully pinned down the cases where it's happening, but it's difficult to reproduce reliably.\r\n\r\nMost recently, I changed the ordering inside a `clsx` + `tailwind-merge` call (`cn`), to change a string className, and move a `className` prop value at the end:\r\n```tsx\r\n// before\r\n<div className={cn(\"bg-white\", className, getMyClassnames(props))} />\r\n\r\n// after\r\n<div className={cn(\"bg-black\", getMyClassnames(props), className)} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo hot reload and no update after a hard refresh, but after restarting the dev server, my change looked correct. Note that `getMyClassnames(...)` is returning a string of Tailwind classes.\r\n\r\n### Project details:\r\n- React 17 SPA on Vite 4 and Turborepo, with SWC plugin\r\n- We previously used Twin.Macro w/ Tailwind v3 and migrated it over to Tailwind v4\r\n\r\n### Environment:\r\n- turbo 2.0.4\r\n- vite 4.5.6\r\n  - @vitejs/plugin-react-swc\r\n  - @swc/plugin-styled-components\r\n- react 17.x\r\n- tailwind 4.1.3\r\n- typescript 4.9.3\r\n\r\nOverall things are working fine. If upgrading Vite or Turbo is necessary to squash some of this behavior, happy to do it, but it may be quite a lift for us depending on how smoothly that goes.\r\n\r\nI don't currently have time to put together a repro repo, but if my schedule opens up I may give it a shot.

My guessing is that since Gatsby is using 'gatsby-plugin-postcss', seems that now the separate postcss package for tailwind is crashing the hot reload and it's causing an infinite loop, by console it's throwing this:\n\n```\n[HMR] css reload http://localhost:8000/commons.css\nclient.js:247 [HMR] bundle 'develop' rebuilt in 226ms\nclient.js:238 [HMR] bundle rebuilding\nclient.js:247 [HMR] bundle 'develop' rebuilt in 229ms\nclient.js:238 [HMR] bundle rebuilding\nclient.js:247 [HMR] bundle 'develop' rebuilt in 232ms\nclient.js:238 [HMR] bundle rebuilding\nclient.js:247 [HMR] bundle 'develop' rebuilt in 245ms\nclient.js:238 [HMR] bundle rebuilding\nprocess-update.js:123 [HMR] Updated modules:\nprocess-update.js:125 [HMR]  - ./.cache/blank.css\nprocess-update.js:125 [HMR]  - ./src/styles/globals.css\n```\nSo, I've tried several things such as: included importing the tailwind.config.js [per as docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide#using-a-javascript-config-file), keep the `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`, among others\n\nBefore, to try implement a different way of using tailwind, which will be stay apart of webpack-postcss, instead going down through a separate build process using tailwindcss/cli and include that extra step in the build pipeline.

While fixing the test, I also noticed that the actual computation was wrong. There are a few cases we have to make sure they work when working with ranges:\r\n\r\n- `0..10..5` — range going from low to high, with a positive step. This should result in `0 5 10`.\r\n- `0..10..-5` — range going from low to high, with a negative step. This should result in `10 5 0`.\r\n- `10..0..5` — range going from high to low, with a positive step. This should result in  `10 5 0`.\r\n- `10..0..-5` — range going from high to low, with a negative step. This should result in  `0 5 10`.\r\n\r\nThis technically means that there are multiple ways to do the same thing. And in case of Tailwind CSS the order doesn't really matter because we apply custom sort rules for utilities. Luckily, the order here doesn't have any influence on the actual generated CSS so it's not the end of the world to support it.\r\n\r\nIntellisense does use a more heavy brace expansion library, and if we don't support this, it also means that you can see a preview of generated classes without generating the actual classes. This also fixes that.\r\n\r\nE.g.: Note how the preview shows the correct values, but nothing has been generated (this is before the change of this PR).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"500\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc2065d2-f2c1-4017-b521-8fd72d41db42\" />\r\n\r\nFixes: #17576\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\n1.

I actually found the light mode settings by accident and changing the setting (any change works for dark mode and light mode works fine) from system settings to dark mode removes the issue. It seems like it doesn't really matter what settings I use between system and dark mode settings, just changing the setting at least once fixes the issue. It always does the issue I mentioned when I first visit the site then I have to go down to the bottom of the page and change mode and then it's fixed. Just to be clear simply changing the setting makes the modes work normal.\n\nI'd suggest a fix if it's not just my browser doing this and putting the modes at the top of the page for people to see easier since I found it by mistake.\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17585","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Dark text shows on dark background\" (#17585)"},{"Id":"2972837058","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-07T09:42:03","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"17562","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make  polyfill work when the theme variable resolves to another var","State":"closed","Body":"Discovered while triaging #17556\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the `color-mix(...)` polyfill to ensure it works when a theme key links to another theme key via a `var(...)` call.\r\n\r\nImagine this setup:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n @theme {\r\n  --color-red: var(--color-red-500);\r\n  --color-red-500: oklch(63.7% 0.237 25.331);\r\n}\r\n@source inline(\"text-red/50\");\r\n````\r\n\r\nSince `--color-red` will link to `--color-red-500` _which is also a known theme variable_, we can inline the value of `--color-red-500` into the fallback now:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.text-red\\\\/50 {\r\n  color: var(--color-red);\r\n}\r\n@supports (color: color-mix(in lab, red, red)) {\r\n  .text-red\\\\/50 {\r\n    color: color-mix(in oklab, var(--color-red) 50%, transparent);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will allow for slightly less confusing behavior.\r\n\r\nThe code added also handles recursive definitions where a color is linking to another color that is again linking to the first one (by adding a `Set` to keep track of already seen variable names).\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\n- Added unit test","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17562","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Make  polyfill work when the theme variable resolves to another var\" (#17562)"},{"Id":"2972476662","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-07T09:18:48","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"17555","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix  polyfill in combination with unused CSS variable removal","State":"closed","Body":"This PR fixes an issue we noticed while investigating #17553, where the unused CSS variable removal didn't work properly when the theme variable it tried to remove was modified by a polyfill rule.\r\n\r\nThe way the bookkeeping for the unused CSS variable worked was that it tired to find the declaration inside it's parent after the traversal. However, the `color-mix(…)` polyfill has since then made changes to the declaration so it can't find it's position correctly anymore and will thus instead delete the last declaration of the node (this caused unrelated CSS variables to be eliminated while the ones with `color-mix(…)` were unexpectedly kept).\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we decided to apply the polyfills after any eventual deletions. This also ensures that no `@supports` query for the variables are created and simplifies the code a bit since all polyfills are now colocated.\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\n- Added a unit test for the example we discovered in #17553\r\n- Luckily the conditions of this seemed rare enough so that it doesn't cause any other of our tests to update.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17555","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix  polyfill in combination with unused CSS variable removal\" (#17555)"},{"Id":"2973964075","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-05T20:24:18","Actor":"samuel871211","Number":"17565","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor[integrations/utils.ts]: change `let` to `const` for those references doesn't change ","State":"closed","Body":"Some variables were declared with the `let` keyword but never reassigned.

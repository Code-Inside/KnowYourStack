Previously the <code class=\"notranslate\">*</code> was required to be at the end of the pattern. It lets you do something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-json\" dir=\"auto\"><pre>{\n  <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"exports\"</span>: {\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"./features/*\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>./features/*.js<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>,\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"./features/*.js\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>./features/*.js<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>\n  }\n}</pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">With this release, esbuild now supports these types of patterns too.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Fix subpath imports with Yarn PnP (<a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2545\">#2545</a>)</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Node has a little-used feature called <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#subpath-imports\">subpath imports</a> which are package-internal imports that start with <code class=\"notranslate\">#</code> and that go through the <code class=\"notranslate\">imports</code> map in <code class=\"notranslate\">package.json</code>. Previously esbuild had a bug that caused esbuild to not handle these correctly in packages installed via Yarn's \"Plug'n'Play\" installation strategy. The problem was that subpath imports were being checked after Yarn PnP instead of before. This release reorders these checks, which should allow subpath imports to work in this case.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Link from JS to CSS in the metafile (<a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1861\">#1861</a>, <a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2565\">#2565</a>)</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">When you import CSS into a bundled JS file, esbuild creates a parallel CSS bundle next to your JS bundle. So if <code class=\"notranslate\">app.ts</code> imports some CSS files and you bundle it, esbuild will give you <code class=\"notranslate\">app.js</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">app.css</code>. You would then add both <code class=\"notranslate\">&lt;script src=\"app.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">&lt;link href=\"app.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\"&gt;</code> to your HTML to include everything in the page. This approach is more efficient than having esbuild insert additional JavaScript into <code class=\"notranslate\">app.js</code> that downloads and includes <code class=\"notranslate\">app.css</code> because it means the browser can download and parse both the CSS and the JS in parallel (and potentially apply the CSS before the JS has even finished downloading).</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">However, sometimes it's difficult to generate the <code class=\"notranslate\">&lt;link&gt;</code> tag. One case is when you've added <code class=\"notranslate\">[hash]</code> to the <a href=\"https://esbuild.github.io/api/#entry-names\">entry names</a> setting to include a content hash in the file name. Then the file name will look something like <code class=\"notranslate\">app-GX7G2SBE.css</code> and may change across subsequent builds. You can tell esbuild to generate build metadata using the <code class=\"notranslate\">metafile</code> API option but the metadata only tells you which generated JS bundle corresponds to a JS entry point (via the <code class=\"notranslate\">entryPoint</code> property), not which file corresponds to the associated CSS bundle. Working around this was hacky and involved string manipulation.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This release adds the <code class=\"notranslate\">cssBundle</code> property to the metafile to make this easier. It's present on the metadata for the generated JS bundle and points to the associated CSS bundle. So to generate the HTML tags for a given JS entry point, you first find the output file with the <code class=\"notranslate\">entryPoint</code> you are looking for (and put that in a <code class=\"notranslate\">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag), then check for the <code class=\"notranslate\">cssBundle</code> property to find the associated CSS bundle (and put that in a <code class=\"notranslate\">&lt;link&gt;</code> tag).</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">One thing to note is that there is deliberately no <code class=\"notranslate\">jsBundle</code> property mapping the other way because it's not a 1:1 relationship. Two JS bundles can share the same CSS bundle in the case where the associated CSS bundles have the same name and content. In that case there would be no one value for a hypothetical <code class=\"notranslate\">jsBundle</code> property to have.</p>\n</li>\n</ul></blockquote>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/releases/tag/v0.15.9\">0.15.9</a></h4>\n\n<blockquote><ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Fix an obscure npm package installation issue with <code class=\"notranslate\">--omit=optional</code> (<a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2558\">#2558</a>)</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The previous release introduced a regression with <code class=\"notranslate\">npm install esbuild --omit=optional</code> where the file <code class=\"notranslate\">node_modules/.bin/esbuild</code> would no longer be present after installation. That could cause any package scripts which used the <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild</code> command to no longer work. This release fixes the regression so <code class=\"notranslate\">node_modules/.bin/esbuild</code> should now be present again after installation. This regression only affected people installing esbuild using <code class=\"notranslate\">npm</code> with either the <code class=\"notranslate\">--omit=optional</code> or <code class=\"notranslate\">--no-optional</code> flag, which is a somewhat unusual situation.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>More details:</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The reason for this regression is due to some obscure npm implementation details. Since the Go compiler doesn't support trivial cross-compiling on certain Android platforms, esbuild's installer installs a WebAssembly shim on those platforms instead. In the previous release I attempted to simplify esbuild's WebAssembly shims to depend on the <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild-wasm</code> package instead of including another whole copy of the WebAssembly binary (to make publishing faster and to save on file system space after installation). However, both the <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild</code> package and the <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild-wasm</code> package provide a binary called <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild</code> and it turns out that adding <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild-wasm</code> as a nested dependency of the <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild</code> package (specifically <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild</code> optionally depends on <code class=\"notranslate\">@esbuild/android-arm</code> which depends on <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild-wasm</code>) caused npm to be confused about what <code class=\"notranslate\">node_modules/.bin/esbuild</code> is supposed to be.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">It's pretty strange and unexpected that disabling the installation of optional dependencies altogether would suddenly cause an optional dependency's dependency to conflict with the top-level package. What happens under the hood is that if <code class=\"notranslate\">--omit=optional</code> is present, npm attempts to uninstall the <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild-wasm</code> nested dependency at the end of <code class=\"notranslate\">npm install</code> (even though the <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild-wasm</code> package was never installed due to <code class=\"notranslate\">--omit=optional</code>). This uninstallation causes <code class=\"notranslate\">node_modules/.bin/esbuild</code> to be deleted.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">After doing a full investigation, I discovered that npm's handling of the <code class=\"notranslate\">.bin</code> directory is deliberately very brittle. When multiple packages in the dependency tree put something in <code class=\"notranslate\">.bin</code> with the same name, the end result is non-deterministic/random. What you get in <code class=\"notranslate\">.bin</code> might be from one package, from the other package, or might be missing entirely. The workaround suggested by npm is to just avoid having two packages that put something in <code class=\"notranslate\">.bin</code> with the same name. So this was fixed by making the <code class=\"notranslate\">@esbuild/android-arm</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild-android-64</code> packages each include another whole copy of the WebAssembly binary, which works because these packages don't put anything in <code class=\"notranslate\">.bin</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul></blockquote>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/releases/tag/v0.15.8\">0.15.8</a></h4>\n\n<blockquote><ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Fix JSX name collision edge case (<a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2534\">#2534</a>)</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Code generated by esbuild could have a name collision in the following edge case:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>The JSX transformation mode is set to <code class=\"notranslate\">automatic</code>, which causes <code class=\"notranslate\">import</code> statements to be inserted</li>\n<li>An element uses a <code class=\"notranslate\">{...spread}</code> followed by a <code class=\"notranslate\">key={...}</code>, which uses the legacy <code class=\"notranslate\">createElement</code> fallback imported from <code class=\"notranslate\">react</code>\n</li>\n<li>Another import uses a name that ends with <code class=\"notranslate\">react</code> such as <code class=\"notranslate\">@remix-run/react</code>\n</li>\n<li>The output format has been set to CommonJS so that <code class=\"notranslate\">import</code> statements are converted into require calls</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">In this case, esbuild previously generated two variables with the same name <code class=\"notranslate\">import_react</code>, like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-js\" dir=\"auto\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">var</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">import_react</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-en\">require</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s\">\"react\"</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">var</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">import_react2</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-en\">require</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-s\">\"@remix-run/react\"</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">;</span></pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">That bug is fixed in this release.

This has made it very easy for esbuild to publish native binary executables for many platforms. However, it strangely doesn't support cross-compiling to Android ARM without installing the Android build tools.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">So instead of publishing a native esbuild binary executable to npm, this release publishes a WebAssembly fallback build. This is essentially the same as the <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild-wasm</code> package but it's installed automatically when you install the <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild</code> package on Android ARM. So packages that depend on the <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild</code> package should now work on Android ARM. This change has not yet been tested end-to-end because I don't have a 32-bit Android ARM device myself, but in theory it should work.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This inherits the drawbacks of WebAssembly including significantly slower performance than native as well as potentially also more severe memory usage limitations and lack of certain features (e.g. <code class=\"notranslate\">--serve</code>). If you want to use a native binary executable of esbuild on Android ARM, you may be able to build it yourself from source after installing the Android build tools.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Attempt to better support Yarn's <code class=\"notranslate\">ignorePatternData</code> feature (<a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2495\">#2495</a>)</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Part of resolving paths in a project using Yarn's Plug'n'Play feature involves evaluating a regular expression in the <code class=\"notranslate\">ignorePatternData</code> property of <code class=\"notranslate\">.pnp.data.json</code>. However, it turns out that the particular regular expressions generated by Yarn use some syntax that works with JavaScript regular expressions but that does not work with Go regular expressions.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">In this release, esbuild will now strip some of the the problematic syntax from the regular expression before compiling it, which should hopefully allow it to be compiled by Go's regular expression engine. The specific character sequences that esbuild currently strips are as follows:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li><code class=\"notranslate\">(?!\\.)</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"notranslate\">(?!(?:^|\\/)\\.)</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"notranslate\">(?!\\.{1,2}(?:\\/|$))</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"notranslate\">(?!(?:^|\\/)\\.{1,2}(?:\\/|$))</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">These seem to be used by Yarn to avoid the <code class=\"notranslate\">.</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">..</code> path segments in the middle of relative paths. The removal of these character sequences seems relatively harmless in this case since esbuild shouldn't ever generate such path segments. This change should add support to esbuild for Yarn's <a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc/#pnpIgnorePatterns\"><code class=\"notranslate\">pnpIgnorePatterns</code></a> feature.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Fix non-determinism issue with legacy block-level function declarations and strict mode (<a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2537\">#2537</a>)</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">When function declaration statements are nested inside a block in strict mode, they are supposed to only be available within that block's scope.

compilation had a subtle bug where the automatically-generated function-level symbols for multible hoisted block-level function declarations in the same block a sloppy-mode context were generated in a random order if the output was in strict mode, which could be the case if TypeScript's <code class=\"notranslate\">alwaysStrict</code> setting was set to true. This lead to non-determinism in the output as the minifier would randomly exchange the generated names for these symbols on different runs. This bug has been fixed by sorting the keys of the unordered map before iterating over them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Fix parsing of <code class=\"notranslate\">@keyframes</code> with string identifiers (<a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2555\">#2555</a>)</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Firefox supports <code class=\"notranslate\">@keyframes</code> with string identifier names. Previously this was treated as a syntax error by esbuild as it doesn't work in any other browser. The specification allows for this however, so it's technically not a syntax error (even though it would be unwise to use this feature at the moment). There was also a bug where esbuild would remove the identifier name in this case as the syntax wasn't recognized.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This release changes esbuild's parsing of <code class=\"notranslate\">@keyframes</code> to now consider this case to be an unrecognized CSS rule. That means it will be passed through unmodified (so you can now use esbuild to bundle this Firefox-specific CSS) but the CSS will not be pretty-printed or minified. I don't think it makes sense for esbuild to have special code to handle this Firefox-specific syntax at this time. This decision can be revisited in the future if other browsers add support for this feature.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Add the <code class=\"notranslate\">--jsx-side-effects</code> API option (<a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2539\">#2539</a>, <a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2546\">#2546</a>)</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">By default esbuild assumes that JSX expressions are side-effect free, which means they are annoated with <code class=\"notranslate\">/* @__PURE__ */</code> comments and are removed during bundling when they are unused. This follows the common use of JSX for virtual DOM and applies to the vast majority of JSX libraries. However, some people have written JSX libraries that don't have this property. JSX expressions can have arbitrary side effects and can't be removed. If you are using such a library, you can now pass <code class=\"notranslate\">--jsx-side-effects</code> to tell esbuild that JSX expressions have side effects so it won't remove them when they are unused.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This feature was contributed by <a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/rtsao\">@rtsao</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul></blockquote>\n<p><em>Does any of this look wrong? <a href=\"https://depfu.com/packages/npm/esbuild/feedback\">Please let us know.</a></em></p>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/c0b8a538c2bf5106977895535010ec402cae75f8...aaae34eb60632f9945c96379fb3fd22580815e9c\">See the full diff on Github</a>.

CKEditor config needs some wrangling because it assumes Webpack. Yet, it works, but only cleanly when Tailwind isn't configured at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhen adding Tailwind config to an otherwise working CKEditor5 build project, the Tailwind plugin outputs a ton of following warnings (even though all the styles --including Tailwind ones-- are being built just fine):\r\n\r\n```\r\nvite:css] Nested CSS was detected, but CSS nesting has not been configured correctly.\r\nPlease enable a CSS nesting plugin *before* Tailwind in your configuration.\r\nSee how here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/using-with-preprocessors#nesting\r\n5  |  \r\n6  |  .ck-content {\r\n7  |    & .image {\r\n   |    ^\r\n8  |            display: table;\r\n9  |            clear: both;\r\n[vite:css] Nested CSS was detected, but CSS nesting has not been configured correctly.\r\nPlease enable a CSS nesting plugin *before* Tailwind in your configuration.\r\nSee how here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/using-with-preprocessors#nesting\r\n14 |    box-sizing: border-box;\r\n15 |  \r\n16 |    & img {\r\n   |    ^\r\n17 |            /* For resized images it is the `<figure>` element that determines the image width. */\r\n18 |            width: 100%;\r\n[vite:css] Nested CSS was detected, but CSS nesting has not been configured correctly.\r\nPlease enable a CSS nesting plugin *before* Tailwind in your configuration.\r\nSee how here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/using-with-preprocessors#nesting\r\n5  |  \r\n6  |  .ck.ck-image-insert-form {\r\n7  |    &:focus {\r\n   |    ^\r\n8  |            /* See: https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/4773 */\r\n9  |            outline: none;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tried all possible permutations for the ordering of the plugins.

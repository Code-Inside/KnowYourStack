When comparing the same HTML with the same utility classes against a Rails project building with Vite (minimal repo [here](https://github.com/phillipspc/railstailwindvite)), that styling looks correct there, but wrong in the gem version.\r\n\r\nHere's a screenshot of a copy/pasted [TailwindUI component](https://tailwindui.com/components/application-ui/forms/input-groups#component-2607d970262ada86428f063c72b1e7bd):\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4410fc8c-1dc5-4eda-b7f0-c396f4ae9d61)\r\n\r\nI opened this [issue originally on the gem's GitHub page](https://github.com/rails/tailwindcss-rails/issues/443), however according to the maintainer:\r\n> There's no magic in this gem, it's just running the upstream tailwindcss CLI against the generated tailwind config.\r\n\r\nSo it seems like whatever is breaking things in the gem is happening \"upstream\". This issue was [first reported](https://github.com/rails/tailwindcss-rails/discussions/441#discussion-7616317) on December 5th. \r\nI'm wondering if anyone from the Tailwind team would have a better idea, given that timing, of what might have changed that would introduce a downstream issue with the `tailwindcss-rails` gem. \r\n\r\nAny help is much appreciated, and if I can assist in providing any better reproduction/troubleshooting steps, I'm happy to do so!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/15426","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Style output via `tailwindcss-rails` gem appears off when compared to other build options\" (#15426)"},{"Id":"2745008453","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-17T18:43:33","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"15421","RawContent":null,"Title":"Work around issue with Node 22 and Jiti","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #15374\r\n\r\nIf we always use Jiti the problem should, in theory, go away (I hope).

Is there a known fix? Imo it seems more like an issue with Safari not properly implementing the latest nested CSS standard than TailwindCSS, but maybe Tailwind is doing some non standard things?\r\n\r\n> Note I have also open an issue on Webkit bugzilla: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=284746 ","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/15406","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Nested CSS not supported in Safari\" (#15406)"},{"Id":"2740164660","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-16T13:17:45","Actor":"MickL","Number":"15399","RawContent":null,"Title":"v4: Vite build fails on Cloudflare","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\n4.0.0-beta.7\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\ntailwindcss: 4.0.0-beta.7\r\nvite: 6.0.3\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\nNode: 22.11.0\r\nBun: 1.1.38\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/MickL/tailwind-vite\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nBuild works fine on my system (macOS) but when deploying to Cloudflare Pages I get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n23:07:02.897 | Executing user command: bun run build\r\n23:07:03.104 | $ vite build\r\n23:07:03.768 | vite v6.0.3 building for production...\r\n23:07:03.829 | transforming...\r\n23:07:03.834 | ‚úì 1 modules transformed.\r\n23:07:03.840 | x Build failed in 40ms\r\n23:07:03.840 | error during build:\r\n23:07:03.840 | [@tailwindcss/vite:generate:build] Object not disposable\r\n23:07:03.841 | file: /opt/buildhome/repo/index.css\r\n23:07:03.841 | at q (file:///opt/buildhome/repo/node_modules/@tailwindcss/vite/dist/index.mjs:1:66)\r\n23:07:03.841 | at P (file:///opt/buildhome/repo/node_modules/@tailwindcss/vite/dist/index.mjs:1:270)\r\n23:07:03.841 | at Object.transform (file:///opt/buildhome/repo/node_modules/@tailwindcss/vite/dist/index.mjs:1:3715)\r\n23:07:03.841 | at Object.handler (file:///opt/buildhome/repo/node_modules/vite/dist/node/chunks/dep-yUJfKD1i.js:50845:15)\r\n23:07:03.841 | at file:///opt/buildhome/repo/node_modules/rollup/dist/es/shared/node-entry.js:20812:40\r\n23:07:03.847 | error: script \"build\" exited with code 1\r\n23:07:03.850 | Failed: Error while executing user command.

I made sure that this was compiled correctly for environments where `using` is not available yet.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that this also relies on `Symbol.dispose` being available. In my testing on our minimal required Node.js version (18) it did work fine. However, turns out that I was using `18.20.x` locally where `Symbol.dispose` **_is_** available, but on older version of Node.js 18 (e.g.: `18.17.x`) it is **_not_** available. This now results in some completely broken builds, e.g.: when running on Cloudflare Pages. See: #15399\r\n\r\nI could reproduce this error in CI, by temporarily downgrading the used Node.js version to `18.17.0`. See:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1142\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5bf30f80-9ca0-40d9-ad02-d1ffb4e0e5dd\" />\r\n\r\nImplementing the proper polyfill, as recommended by the TypeScript docs ( see: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-5-2.html#:~:text=Symbol.dispose,-??=%20Symbol(%22Symbol.dispose ), the error goes away.

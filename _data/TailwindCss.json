Projects were failing to compile with a tailwind exited with 132 error. It was suggested on the elixir forums I should test the tailwind binary directly.\n\nI downloaded the latest 3.6.14 release and ran it. It runs fine and shows the usage and options. Then I tested the latest 4.1.10 and it fails to run with an illegal hardware instruction error. I then tested the earliest release of 4 I could find on github and it also failed with an illegal hardware instruction error.\n\nAs a sanity check I set up a debian 12 vm on my MacBook Pro and downloaded the 4.1.10 version for linux-x64 and it runs fine in the VM so it seems to be something specific about the way the Mac version is built and not an inherent need for a particular hardware instruction.

This causes production deployments to have missing CSS when developing on a different architecture.\n\n## Reproduction\n\nI've created a minimal reproduction repository with Docker-based tests:\nhttps://github.com/elepedus/tailwindcss-v4-arch-bug\n\n### Quick reproduction:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/elepedus/tailwindcss-v4-arch-bug.git\ncd tailwindcss-v4-arch-bug\n./verify.sh  # or docker compose up\n```\n\n## Current Behavior\n\nWhen building the same HTML/CSS with Tailwind v4:\n- **AMD64**: Generates 83,999 bytes of CSS\n- **ARM64**: Generates 88,803 bytes of CSS\n- **Difference**: 4,804 bytes (5.7% larger on ARM64)\n\nThe AMD64 build is missing CSS rules for arbitrary value classes like `left-[40rem]`.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\nTailwind should generate identical CSS output regardless of CPU architecture, as it does in v3.\n\n## Visual Impact\n\nThe missing CSS causes visible differences:\n\n**AMD64 Build** - Gradient is missing:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96f08680-66b1-48aa-8470-3fd86b8ed2de)\n\n**ARM64 Build** - Gradient displays correctly:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0d5eb36-6ae1-4e43-bc6b-7b28dd4e3188)\n\n## Environment\n\n- **Tailwind CSS version**: v4.0.0 through v4.1.10 (latest)\n- **Node version**: N/A (using standalone binaries)\n- **Operating System**: Linux (via Docker)\n- **CPU Architectures**: linux/amd64 and linux/arm64\n\n## Additional Context\n\n1. This bug does **NOT** affect Tailwind v3.x - it produces identical output on both architectures\n2. The issue appears to be in the architecture-specific binaries\n3. This is causing production breakage for users developing on ARM64 Macs and deploying to AMD64 servers\n4. Phoenix Framework 1.8.0-rc.3 users are particularly affected as it defaults to Tailwind v4\n\n## Workarounds\n\n1. Use Tailwind v3 until this is fixed\n2. Ensure development and production use the same CPU architecture\n3. Build CSS on the target deployment architecture\n4. Avoid arbitrary value classes\n\n## Related\n\nThis was discovered while debugging Phoenix Framework deployments where CSS worked locally but not in production.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18315","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Tailwind v4 generates different CSS on ARM64 vs AMD64 architectures\" (#18315)"},{"Id":"3156946897","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-18T13:42:29","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"18337","RawContent":null,"Title":"Document `--watch=always` in the CLI","State":"open","Body":"Closes https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/issues/1835\r\n\r\nWe had this in v3 as an undocumented option.

This creates inconsistent spacing when elements are followed by different types of content (e.g., paragraphs vs divs).\n\n## Example\n```html\n<div class=\"space-y-2\">\n  <p>First paragraph</p>\n  <div>Image container</div>\n  <p>Second paragraph</p>\n</div>\n```\n\n## Current Behavior\n- The `space-y-2` class applies `margin-block-start` to elements (except first child)\n- No equivalent `margin-block-end` is applied\n- This results in more space above elements than below them\n- The issue is particularly noticeable when mixing different element types\n\n## CSS that causes this (this adds the extra spacing on the top, but not the bottom)\n```css\n:where(.space-y-2 > :not(:last-child)) {\n    --tw-space-y-reverse: 0;\n    margin-block-start: calc(calc(var(--spacing) * 2) * var(--tw-space-y-reverse));\n    margin-block-end: calc(calc(var(--spacing) * 2) * calc(1 - var(--tw-space-y-reverse)));\n}\n```\n\nI fixed this by adding the following:\n```css\n.space-y-2 > :not(:last-child) {\n  margin-block-end: 0.5rem !important;\n}\n\n.space-y-2 > :not(:first-child) {\n  margin-block-start: 0.5rem !important;\n}\n```\n\nIs this intended?

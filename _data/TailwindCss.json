This in turn requires us to bump it in the `stable` engine as well. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that our `stable` engine is using Node.js v12 and the latest `rimraf` version requires Node.js v14.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, we can keep using `rimraf` v3 in the `stable` engine and use the newer `rimraf` v4 in the `oxide` engine. The only requirement is that we conditionally use the correct API for the current version.\r\n\r\nCloses: #10579\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nüëã Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

But I like to make the element full width on viewport `md`. The default value of `justify-content` is normally `justify-content: normal` (maybe differs on other browsers?). But there is no way to \"reset\" back to `normal` value.\r\n\r\nDo you have suggestions to solve my issue, or is this value missing from the core?\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nElement not full width: https://play.tailwindcss.com/pj23KKG5cV\r\nWhat I like to achieve/Expected behaviour: https://play.tailwindcss.com/oQ38fSUAsn\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nDavy\r\n\r\n_PS.

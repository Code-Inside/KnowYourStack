The `master` branch represents v3, all of oxide is in the `next` branch which represents v4.\r\n\r\nThis branch still has a lot of `crosscheck` related checks in the tests but I wanted to do a minimal amount of work to get the repo in a better state. Before this PR we had both the `stable` and `oxide` codebase, and we had to swap engines when working on one or the other. \r\n\r\nCI also used the swap engines scripts to run the tests against the correct engine. In a previous PR we already dropped all the oxide specific workflows from CI so only the stable engine remains.\r\n\r\nThis PR does a few things without touching a bajillion amount of test files:\r\n\r\n- Swaps the engines by default, so that the `stable` engine is the default engine instead of the `oxide` engine.\r\n- Removes all the `oxide` related code, again just because this is all implemented in v4 which is represented by the `next` branch.\r\n- Updates CI to not use `swap-engines`, because we don't need it anymore `stable` _is_ the default engine.\r\n- Removes the `swap-engine.js` script.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a Part 1, the reason being is that all our test files still use a `crosscheck` function that we used to use to test against both engines. `crosscheck` is still there but it only ever runs against the `stable` engine.\r\n\r\nThe reason we're doing this in two parts is because we want to make the smallest change possible that can be merged without checking a lot of tests files as well.\r\n\r\nThis is the first step in getting the `master` branch in a `v3`-only state instead of a mixed state.\r\n\r\nNote: it could be that we get a bunch of Depfu related PRs to bump certain versions. There is a high chance that CI will start failing (especially around major version bumps). We also have to make sure to not bump certain dependencies (double check each failing depfu PR) so that we don't introduce breaking changes in v3.\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

The CSS variables used in `transform`, `translate` and so forth are partially undefined in Firefox, rendering the entire rule without effect.\r\n\r\nIn the example above, the `<p>` should be translated by 2rem to the right, using `transform translate-x-8`. This works in Chrome and Safari as previously in < 4.0.0, because `translate-x-*` expands to two rules, one for setting `--tw-translate-x` and one for rendering\r\n\r\n```css\r\ntransform: translate(var(--tw-translate-x),var(--tw-translate-y)) rotate(var(--tw-rotate)) skewX(var(--tw-skew-x)) skewY(var(--tw-skew-y)) scaleX(var(--tw-scale-x)) scaleY(var(--tw-scale-y));\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the rest of the variables are defaulted from the preflight settings.\r\n\r\nIn v4, these are set via CSS's `@property` rules with appropriate defaults, but those at-rules are not yet supported in mainline Firefox. `translate-x-*` is also expanded into a singular rule, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.translate-x-8 {\r\n    --tw-translate-x: 3rem;\r\n    translate: var(--tw-translate-x) var(--tw-translate-y);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the undefinedness of --tw-translate-y breaks the property's effect. You can quickly fix this by adding\r\n\r\n```css\r\n--tw-translate-x: 0;\r\n--tw-translate-y: 0;\r\n--tw-rotate: 0;\r\n--tw-skew-x: 0;\r\n--tw-skew-y: 0;\r\n--tw-scale-x: 1;\r\n--tw-scale-y: 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nto your `@theme` block to default them at the root.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13268","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[v4] `transform` utilities not working in Firefox due to no support for `@property`\" (#13268)"},{"Id":"2190657699","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-17T13:00:43","Actor":"zoomoid","Number":"13267","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] `max-w-screen-*` utilities are not provided by default","State":"open","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\nv4.0.0-alpha.9\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\n@tailwindcss/postcss 4.0.0-alpha.9, Next.js 14.1.3\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\nv20.11.0\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\n\r\nChrome, Firefox, Safari\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\n\r\nmacOS\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\n\r\nClone the NextJS repo at <https://github.com/zoomoid/tailwindcss-4-experiments> and run the project in `missing-screen-widths`.

When they are, we can safely remove the overwrite.\r\n- If you are extending the `spacing` theme, we will unset the default `--spacing` scale and only use the values you provided.\r\n- Any `theme()` function calls are replaced with `calc(var(--spacing) * multiplier)` unless the values are extending the default scale.\r\n\r\nOne caveat here is for `theme()` key which can not be replaced with `var()` (e.g. in `@media` attribute positions). These will not be able to be replaced with `calc()` either so the following needs to stay unmigrated:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@media (max-width: theme(spacing.96)) {\r\n  .foo {\r\n    color: red;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\nWe are mainly testing two scenarios: The JS config _extends_ the `spacing` namespace and the JS config _overwrites_ the `spacing` namespace. For both cases we have added an integration test each to ensure this works as expected. The test contains a mixture of keys (some of it matching the default multiples, some don't, some have different scales, and some use non-numeric identifiers). In addition to asserting on the created CSS `@theme`, we also ensure that `theme()` calls are properly replaced.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14905","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Upgrade: Migrate spacing scale\" (#14905)"},{"Id":"2641494339","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-07T19:08:06","Actor":"adamwathan","Number":"14909","RawContent":null,"Title":"Rename `--font-size-*` variables to `--text-*`","State":"closed","Body":"This PR updates all of the `--font-size-*` variables to `--text-*` instead to closer match the utility names.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n  @theme {\r\n-   --font-size-xs: 0.75rem;\r\n-   --font-size-xs--line-height: 1rem;\r\n-   --font-size-sm: 0.875rem;\r\n-   --font-size-sm--line-height: 1.25rem;\r\n-   --font-size-base: 1rem;\r\n-   --font-size-base--line-height: 1.5rem;\r\n-   --font-size-lg: 1.125rem;\r\n-   --font-size-lg--line-height: 1.75rem;\r\n-   --font-size-xl: 1.25rem;\r\n-   --font-size-xl--line-height: 1.75rem;\r\n\r\n    /* ... */\r\n  \r\n+   --text-xs: 0.75rem;\r\n+   --text-xs--line-height: 1rem;\r\n+   --text-sm: 0.875rem;\r\n+   --text-sm--line-height: 1.25rem;\r\n+   --text-base: 1rem;\r\n+   --text-base--line-height: 1.5rem;\r\n+   --text-lg: 1.125rem;\r\n+   --text-lg--line-height: 1.75rem;\r\n+   --text-xl: 1.25rem;\r\n+   --text-xl--line-height: 1.75rem;\r\n\r\n    /* ... */\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is part of a bigger set of changes where we're renaming other theme variables as well with the same goals, since many existing theme variables like `--shadow-*` and `--radius-*` are already not using the explicit CSS property name.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14909","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Rename `--font-size-*` variables to `--text-*`\" (#14909)"},{"Id":"2641274715","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-07T16:18:03","Actor":"JavierM42","Number":"14907","RawContent":null,"Title":"Default border color (gray-200) doesn't work with flat palettes","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\nv3.4.14\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\nVite\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\nv22.9\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\n\r\nChrome\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\n\r\nmacOS\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\n\r\nWith default palette: [Tailwind Play link](https://play.tailwindcss.com/oaGggnbAx3)\r\n\r\nWith custom, nested palette: [Tailwind Play link](https://play.tailwindcss.com/nJ1AAtAGTj)\r\n\r\nWith flat palette: [Tailwind Play link](https://play.tailwindcss.com/blTtLoJNkb)\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nThe TailwindCSS reset sets the default border color to `gray-200`.\r\n\r\nIf I change the value of `gray-200`, I expect the default border color to take that value.\r\n\r\nIf my palette is nested (`{ gray: { 200: newValue } }`), the default border color takes the new value as expected.\r\n\r\nIf my palette is flat (`{ 'gray-200' newValue }`), the default border color is the browser default.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/14907","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Default border color (gray-200) doesn't work with flat palettes\" (#14907)"},{"Id":"2641493084","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-07T16:08:40","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"14908","RawContent":null,"Title":"Upgrade: Add `--shadow-inner` theme variable when `shadow-inner` class is used","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14908","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Upgrade: Add `--shadow-inner` theme variable when `shadow-inner` class is used\" (#14908)"},{"Id":"2640758451","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-07T15:48:49","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"14903","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add new `**` variant","State":"closed","Body":"This PR adds a new `**` variant to target any level of children.\n\nThis is very similar to the `*` variant, the big difference is that:\n\n- `*` applies to direct children only\n- `**` applies to any level of children\n\nThought of this because of all the recent work we did around globs.

However, if the `<table>` is directly in the route file, the styles are applied correctly.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Next.js project with the App Router and Tailwind CSS installed. \r\n2. Create a new component (e.g., Table.tsx) that contains a `<table>` with Tailwind CSS classes in question (\r\n   border-separate and border-spacing-y-*). Ex:\r\n   ```tsx\r\n       export default function SomeTableComponent() {\r\n         return (\r\n           <table className=\"table-auto w-full shadow-lg mt-5 rounded border-separate border-spacing-y-3\">\r\n           <thead className=\"text-left text-gray-500 tracking-wider\">\r\n           <tr>\r\n             <th className=\"p-4\">Col A</th>\r\n             <th className=\"p-4\">Col B</th>\r\n             <th className=\"p-4\">Col C</th>\r\n           </tr>\r\n           </thead>\r\n           <tbody>\r\n           <tr className=\"bg-card rounded text-gray-200 bg-neutral-900\">\r\n             <td className=\"p-4\">Value A</td>\r\n             <td className=\"p-4\">Value B</td>\r\n             <td className=\"p-4\">Value C</td>\r\n           </tr>\r\n           </tbody>\r\n          </table>\r\n        );\r\n        }\r\n   ```\r\n3. Import the component into a route file (e.g., index.tsx) and use it. Ex:\r\n   ```tsx\r\n   import SomeTableComponent from \"@/features/tst/components/SomeTableComponent\";\r\n\r\n   export default function Home() {\r\n   return (\r\n     <main className=\"flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24\">\r\n       <SomeTableComponent />\r\n     </main>\r\n   );\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4. Run the Next.js development server and inspect the rendered table.\r\n\r\n    - When `<SomeTableComponent />` is used within a route file (page.tsx), the `border-separate` and\r\n      `border-spacing-y-3` classes are not applied to the `<table />` element. As a result, no spacing appears between\r\n      rows.\r\n    - If the `<table>` is defined directly in page.tsx without being nested in a separate component, the\r\n      `border-separate` and `border-spacing-y-3` styles are applied correctly, and spacing appears between rows as\r\n      expected.\r\n\r\n5.

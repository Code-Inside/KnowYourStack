The legacy `theme(…)` function is still available for backwards compatibility reasons, but this allows us to be future proof since `--foo(…)` is the syntax the CSS spec recommends. See: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-mixins/\n\nIn addition, this PR implements a new `--spacing(…)` function, this allows you to write:\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n@theme {\n  --spacing: 0.25rem;\n}\n\n.foo {\n  margin: --spacing(4):\n}\n```\n\nThis is syntax sugar over:\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n@theme {\n  --spacing: 0.25rem;\n}\n\n.foo {\n  margin: calc(var(--spacing) * 4);\n}\n```\n\nIf your `@theme` uses the `inline` keyword, we will also make sure to inline the value:\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n@theme inline {\n  --spacing: 0.25rem;\n}\n\n.foo {\n  margin: --spacing(4):\n}\n```\n\nBoils down to:\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n@theme {\n  --spacing: 0.25rem;\n}\n\n.foo {\n  margin: calc(0.25rem * 4); /* And will be optimised to just 1rem */\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nAnother new function function we added is the `--alpha(…)` function that requires a value, and a number / percentage value. This allows you to apply an alpha value to any color, but with a much shorter syntax:\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n.foo {\n  color: --alpha(var(--color-red-500), 0.5);\n}\n```\n\nThis is syntax sugar over:\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n.foo {\n  color: color-mix(in oklab, var(--color-red-500) 50%, transparent);\n}\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/15572","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Implement `--spacing(…)`, `--alpha(…)` and `--theme(…)` CSS functions\" (#15572)"},{"Id":"2775741348","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-08T16:17:36","Actor":"zyyv","Number":"15571","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove extra commas in `ring-inset`","State":"closed","Body":"<!--\r\n\r\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

The motivation for a distinct at rule is that `@import` is already handled outside of Tailwind in some scenarios (e.g. when using in combination with postcss-import, other pre-processors, or frameworks like Svelte). While our implementation of hijacking the `media` attribute _works in this cases_, it can cause annoying linter issues because tooling build around `@import` does not know about our behavior.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we've decided to move this mode into a separate at rule that is passed-through in the other tooling. Here's an example of how this would look like in Svelte:\r\n\r\n```svelte\r\n<h1>Hello world!</h1>\r\n\r\n<style>\r\n  @reference './theme.css';\r\n  h1 {\r\n    color: var(--theme-color);\r\n  }\r\n</style>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this change, the Svelte linter would not be detecting unused CSS from the `theme.css` file as it would if we'd rely on `@import`.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/15565","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add `@reference \"…\"`\" (#15565)"},{"Id":"2769295049","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-07T15:19:37","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"15542","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ensure `@utility` is processed before using them","State":"closed","Body":"This PR fixes an issue where using an `@utility` before it is defined, and _if_ that `@utility` contains `@apply`, that it won't result in the expected output. But results in an `@apply` rule that is not substituted. Additionally, if you have multiple levels of `@apply`, we have to make sure that everything is applied (no pun intended) in the right order.\r\n\r\nRight now, the following steps are taken:\r\n\r\n1. Collect all the `@utility` at-rules (and register them in the system as utilities).\r\n2. Substitute `@apply` on the AST (including `@utility`'s ASTs) with the content of the utility.\r\n3. Delete the `@utility` at-rules such that they are removed from the CSS output itself.\r\n\r\nThe reason we do it in this order is because handling `@apply` during `@utility`\r\nhandling means that we could rely on another `@utility` that is defined later\r\nand therefore the order of the utilities starts to matter. This is not a bad\r\nthing, but the moment you import multiple CSS files or plugins, this could\r\nbecome hard to manage.\r\n\r\nAnother important step is that when using `@utility foo`, the implementation creates a `structuredClone` from its AST when first using the utility. The reason we do that is because `foo` and `foo!` generate different output and we don't want to accidentally mutate the same AST. This structured clone is the start of the problem in the linked issue (#15501).\r\n\r\nIf we don't do the structured clone, then substituting the `@apply` rules would work, but then `foo` and `foo!` will generate the same output, which is bad.\r\n\r\nThe linked issue has this structure:\r\n```css\r\n.foo {\r\n  @apply bar;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@utility bar {\r\n  @apply flex;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we follow the steps above, this would substitute `@apply bar` first, which\r\nresults in:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.foo {\r\n  @apply flex;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the `bar` utility, was already cloned (and cached) so now we end up with an `@apply` rule that is not substituted.\r\n\r\nTo properly solve this problem, we have to make sure that we collect all the `@apply` at-rules, and apply them in the correct order. To do this, we run a topological sort on them which ensures that all the dependencies are applied before substituting the current `@apply`.\r\n\r\nThis means that in the above example, in order to process `@apply bar`, we have to process the `bar` utility first.\r\n\r\nIf we run into a circular dependency, then we will throw an error like before. You'll notice that the error message in this PR is updated to a different spot. This one is a bit easier to grasp because it shows the error where the circular dependency _starts_ not where it _ends_ (and completes the circle). The previous message was not wrong (since it's a circle), but now it's a bit easier to reason about.\r\n\r\nFixes: #15501\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/15542","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Ensure `@utility` is processed before using them\" (#15542)"},{"Id":"2771231099","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-07T14:57:38","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"15558","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add `@tailwindcss/browser` package","State":"closed","Body":"We're going to publish the CDN / browser build of v4 as an npm package so it can be loaded from things like unpkg.

Reduce array allocations while walking to build a `path` to the current node. This re-uses the existing `path` array and pushes the current node before the recursive call and pops it afterwards. This way we don't need to allocate a new array for each recursive call. Testing this on Tailwind UI means ~14k fewer allocations.\r\n2.

CPU and memory footprint are low during that time.</em></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Deployments without any protection against long running Server Action invocations are especially vulnerable. Hosting providers like Vercel or Netlify set a default maximum duration on function execution to reduce the risk of excessive billing.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This is the same issue as if the incoming HTTP request has an invalid <code class=\"notranslate\">Content-Length</code> header or never closes. If the host has no other mitigations to those then this vulnerability is novel.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This vulnerability affects only Next.js deployments using Server Actions.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Patches</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This vulnerability was resolved in Next.js 14.2.21, 15.1.2, and 13.5.8.

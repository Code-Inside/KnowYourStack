I personally found it very difficult to know which values actually existed at the higher end of the scale without IntelliSense, and in practice even when working with a skilled designer like [Steve](https://x.com/steveschoger) who helped design Tailwind's default spacing scale, I'd very often need to break out of it to implement a design, and trying to round to a value that was in the scale made the design worse, not better.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows you to use any whole number, as well as decimal numbers that are multiples of `0.25` to ensure classes like `px-1.5` continue to work. While this means you can now technically do things like `pt-97.25`, I think the presence of the fractional value will be enough of a signal to developers that they are doing something a little unusual, and they can use their judgment as to whether they are making the right decision or not.\r\n\r\nI'll update this PR with a lot more detail when I have a chance, as there are a few other things to explain like:\r\n\r\n- Unifying all of the values for width/min-width/max-width/height/min-height/max-height utilities\r\n- Deriving numeric line-height values from the spacing multiplier instead of a separate line-height scale\r\n- Using `--spacing: initial` to disable the multiplier\r\n- How you can still use an explicit spacing scale and ignore this change\r\n- How we plan to use IntelliSense to surface a more curated set of spacing values even if smaller increments work when you type them explicitly","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14857","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Replace default explicit spacing scale with multiplier system\" (#14857)"},{"Id":"2636225411","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-05T19:47:53","Actor":"rei-shaholli","Number":"14882","RawContent":null,"Title":"Tailwind CSS Classes (border-spacing-y-*, border-separate) Not Applying in Next.js App Router with Nested Component","State":"closed","Body":"tailwind version: v3.4.14\r\nNext.js 14.2.16\r\nNode v20.9.0\r\nChrome\r\nmacOS, Windows\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\nhttps://github.com/rei-shaholli/tailwind_border_spacing_table_issue\r\n\r\n**Issue**\r\n\r\n# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying in Next.js App Router with Nested Component\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nWhen using Tailwind CSS with Next.js (App Router), certain table-specific Tailwind classes such as border-separate and\r\nborder-spacing-y-* are not applied if the `<table>` is embedded within a nested component that is then used inside a\r\nroute (e.g., page.tsx). However, if the `<table>` is directly in the route file, the styles are applied correctly.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Next.js project with the App Router and Tailwind CSS installed. \r\n2. Create a new component (e.g., Table.tsx) that contains a `<table>` with Tailwind CSS classes in question (\r\n   border-separate and border-spacing-y-*). Ex:\r\n   ```tsx\r\n       export default function SomeTableComponent() {\r\n         return (\r\n           <table className=\"table-auto w-full shadow-lg mt-5 rounded border-separate border-spacing-y-3\">\r\n           <thead className=\"text-left text-gray-500 tracking-wider\">\r\n           <tr>\r\n             <th className=\"p-4\">Col A</th>\r\n             <th className=\"p-4\">Col B</th>\r\n             <th className=\"p-4\">Col C</th>\r\n           </tr>\r\n           </thead>\r\n           <tbody>\r\n           <tr className=\"bg-card rounded text-gray-200 bg-neutral-900\">\r\n             <td className=\"p-4\">Value A</td>\r\n             <td className=\"p-4\">Value B</td>\r\n             <td className=\"p-4\">Value C</td>\r\n           </tr>\r\n           </tbody>\r\n          </table>\r\n        );\r\n        }\r\n   ```\r\n3. Import the component into a route file (e.g., index.tsx) and use it. Ex:\r\n   ```tsx\r\n   import SomeTableComponent from \"@/features/tst/components/SomeTableComponent\";\r\n\r\n   export default function Home() {\r\n   return (\r\n     <main className=\"flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24\">\r\n       <SomeTableComponent />\r\n     </main>\r\n   );\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4. Run the Next.js development server and inspect the rendered table.\r\n\r\n    - When `<SomeTableComponent />` is used within a route file (page.tsx), the `border-separate` and\r\n      `border-spacing-y-3` classes are not applied to the `<table />` element. As a result, no spacing appears between\r\n      rows.\r\n    - If the `<table>` is defined directly in page.tsx without being nested in a separate component, the\r\n      `border-separate` and `border-spacing-y-3` styles are applied correctly, and spacing appears between rows as\r\n      expected.\r\n\r\n5. Please refer to the `./app/test/page.tsx` and `./app/test/components/SomeTableComponent.tsx` files for the relevant\r\n   code.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/14882","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Tailwind CSS Classes (border-spacing-y-*, border-separate) Not Applying in Next.js App Router with Nested Component\" (#14882)"},{"Id":"2636030620","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-05T17:34:44","Actor":"adamwathan","Number":"14880","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make `ease-linear` a static utility","State":"closed","Body":"This PR removes `--transition-timing-function-linear` from the default theme in favor of a static `ease-linear` utility.

It should've been rewritten to `./image.png` but was not. Letting Vite handle the imports will rewrite these urls properly — which is what this PR does. It achieves this by running our CSS generation when typtical Vite plugins do rather than before (via `enforce: 'pre'`).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, because we were running the generation step early, Vue had not handled `:deep(…)` selectors in `<style scoped>` blocks yet and we were caching the unprocessed CSS. This is also fixed by this PR.\r\n\r\nIdeally both of these things would be fixable by changing how we handle imports but that will require additional APIs so this is a reasonable stopgap measure until we can do that.\r\n\r\nFixes #14839\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14850","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Generate CSS after Vite handles imports during prod builds\" (#14850)"},{"Id":"2627533246","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-31T18:24:18","Actor":"adamwathan","Number":"14847","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove `--drop-shadow-none` from default theme","State":"closed","Body":"This PR removes `--drop-shadow-none` from the default theme which shouldn't ever have been there since we handle all `*-none` utilities as static/permanent utilities in the framework now.\r\n\r\nI've added `drop-shadow-none` as an explicit static utility, and also slightly improved test coverage for `getClassList` around drop shadows while touching this part of the code.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14847","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Remove `--drop-shadow-none` from default theme\" (#14847)"},{"Id":"2627364836","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-31T16:56:50","Actor":"MOZGIII","Number":"14845","RawContent":null,"Title":"The social image for this Github repo is outdated","State":"open","Body":"<img width=\"753\" alt=\"Снимок экрана 2024-10-31 в 13 54 33\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8cc45a3-066d-4535-8324-bc1b7952fcab\">\r\n<img width=\"250\" alt=\"Снимок экрана 2024-10-31 в 13 55 57\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57c40f5f-e80d-4977-860b-a68ddaa268b3\">\r\n\r\nSocial image says `3.0`, last version is `3.4` already 🤔 \r\n\r\nThis is just a nit though, feel free to close this","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/14845","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The social image for this Github repo is outdated\" (#14845)"},{"Id":"2626895625","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-31T13:56:27","Actor":"gabriel-montrose","Number":"14842","RawContent":null,"Title":"Tailwind & Vite & React - Broke styles","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?** ^3.4.14\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\n- vite@5.35\r\n- autoprefixer@10.4.20\r\n- postcss@8.4.47\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?** v22.4.1\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?** Chrome\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**macOS, Windows\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nWe migrate app to new UI, and release partially.

For example, that `justify-around` or `justify-end` would affect item placement.\r\n\r\nThat is true using the plain CSS grid, assuming that there's free horizontal space around the grid items on which these placement controls can be applied.\r\n\r\nBut, (note: I'm no CSS export) it seems Tailwind's `grid-cols-N` styles generate a `grid-template-columns` that will take up all the available space per grid item, so there's no room left for the controls to kick in, effectively resulting in no-op placement.\r\n\r\nSee the linked Tailwind Play. But to be brief:\r\n\r\nWhat Tailwind generates, kind of (see the grid-template-columns):\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"bg-blue-100\" style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, minmax(0, 1fr)); justify-content: flex-end;\">\r\n  <div class=\"mx-auto bg-red-100\">1</div>\r\n  <div class=\"mx-auto bg-red-200\">2 2</div>\r\n  <div class=\"mx-auto bg-red-300\">3 3 3</div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing manual CSS with `max-content` instead of the `minmax(0, 1fr)` works:\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"bg-blue-100\" style=\"display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, max-content); justify-content: flex-end;\">\r\n  <div class=\"bg-red-100\">1</div>\r\n  <div class=\"bg-red-200\">2 2</div>\r\n  <div class=\"bg-red-300\">3 3 3</div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I understand that the grid template gives lot of options on the column sizing (see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/repeat#track-size, though I'm a bit lost in grid docs), and it might not be Tailwind's profile to pick a single choice or give finer control of this choice (or what are even the common choices, no idea). But it would then be nice if the docs pointed out these controls won't work for grid, as it could save quite some time.\r\n\r\n(Thank you btw for Tailwind, it is a gift! Bought Refactoring UI too, excellent book. Now I can stop writing bootstrap-as-a-programmer, and write... tailwind-as-a-programmer)","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/11259","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"justify- utilities don't work with grid, or documentation problem\" (#11259)"},{"Id":"1717450141","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-19T16:13:02","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"11260","RawContent":null,"Title":"Explicitly list published CSS files ","State":"closed","Body":"This PR explicitly lists the CSS files that are published to NPM instead of relying on `*.css`.\n\nThe main reason for this change is that we will expose `index.css` for the oxide engine to make\nthings a bit smoother, but there is no need to include this new feature in the stable release (3.3.x).\n\n\n<!--\n\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

Here is his feedback as well as my resolution notes:\r\n\r\n<details><summary>(expand/collapse @adamwathan's feedback)</summary><br />\r\n\r\n> Hey thanks @brandonmcconnell! I'm going to close this one for now for a couple reasons:\r\n> \r\n> 1. I'm not sold on the new colon prefix syntax — I don't really want to add new syntax conventions to the framework for just one feature without really thinking hard about it, and in this case my instinct would be to introduce new variants like `min-h-[...]` and `max-h-[...]` instead which feels a lot simpler.\r\n> 2. There are issues with the implementation that prevent any media queries using the new syntax from being sorted correctly. For example, this HTML:\r\n>    ```\r\n>    <div class=\"min-[h:50px]:underline min-[h:200px]:underline min-[h:100px]:underline\">\r\n>        <!-- ... -->\r\n>    </div>\r\n>    ```\r\n>    \r\n>    ...generates this CSS, which is in the wrong order:\r\n>    ```css\r\n>    @media (min-height: 100px) {\r\n>      .min-\\[h\\:100px\\]\\:underline {\r\n>          text-decoration-line: underline;\r\n>      }\r\n>    }\r\n>    \r\n>    @media (min-height: 200px) {\r\n>      .min-\\[h\\:200px\\]\\:underline {\r\n>          text-decoration-line: underline;\r\n>      }\r\n>    }\r\n>    \r\n>    @media (min-height: 50px) {\r\n>      .min-\\[h\\:50px\\]\\:underline {\r\n>          text-decoration-line: underline;\r\n>      }\r\n>    }\r\n>    ```\r\n> \r\n> We've found the only way to successfully stay on top of issues and PRs in a project as big as Tailwind is to be pretty strict about either merging or closing a PR when we review it and not leaving it open, because otherwise things really pile up as often people lose interest in pushing things forward or we simply never reach the point where we're sure it's a good idea to merge something. Hope you understand and know we still value the contribution even if it wasn't merged 👍\r\n> \r\n> If still interested in pushing this forward, feel free to open another PR at some point based on the feedback above and we can reconsider.

We use it in a very similar fashion for arbitrary values for [resolving ambiguities](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#resolving-ambiguities), which is also pretty close in practice to what we’re trying to achieve here — providing a means to resolve the ambiguity in a media query dimension (which defaults to `width` using width naturally).\r\n  * _alternative syntax considerations_ — I also considered using something more like `min-h-[100px]` and `max-h-[100px]`, but…\r\n    * that would conflict with the existing `min-width`, `max-width`, `min-height`, and `max-height` utilities\r\n    * using a different syntax from the currently employed [dynamic breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#arbitrary-values) syntax added in v3.2 (i.e. `max-*` and `max-*`) could potentially be a breaking change for some users\r\n*  ✅ Re **sorting** — sorting is now FIXED as of commit [265b48](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/commit/265b48435b31936869b474e62c7fbf1cbcd099cb), and I've included a test for it\r\n\r\n</details>","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/11225","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add support for dimension prefix when using dynamic `min-*` and `max-*` (resolved sorting)\" (#11225)"},{"Id":"1706602297","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-13T11:26:25","Actor":"brandonmcconnell","Number":"11217","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add support for dimension prefix when using dynamic `min-*` and `max-*`","State":"closed","Body":"This PR adds support for using a new dimension prefix with dynamic `min-*` and `max-*` variants. \r\n\r\n### Syntax:\r\n`type-[length]` or `type-[dimension:length]`, where…\r\n* `type`: `'min' | 'max'`\r\n* `dimension`: `'w' | 'h'` (optional, can be excluded to omit and default to `width`)\r\n* `length`: any valid CSS length\r\n\r\n### Syntax examples:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/* min-[100px]   */ @media (min-width: 100px)\r\n/* min-[w:100px] */ @media (min-width: 100px)\r\n/* min-[h:100px] */ @media (min-height: 100px)\r\n/* max-[100px]   */ @media (max-width: 100px)\r\n/* max-[w:100px] */ @media (max-width: 100px)\r\n/* max-[h:100px] */ @media (max-height: 100px)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Real use case examples:\r\n* only applied on screens taller than `100px`\r\n\r\n  ```html\r\n  <div class=\"min-[h:100px]:font-bold\" />\r\n  ```\r\n* only applied on screens taller and narrower than `100px`\r\n\r\n  ```html\r\n  <!-- without `w:` -->\r\n  <div class=\"min-[h:100px]:max-[100px]:font-bold\" />\r\n  <!-- or with `w:` -->\r\n  <div class=\"min-[h:100px]:max-[w:100px]:font-bold\" />\r\n  ```\r\n* only applied on screens shorter and narrower than `100px` (no conflict between `max-[w?:]` and `max-[h:]`)\r\n\r\n  ```html\r\n  <!-- without `w:` -->\r\n  <div class=\"max-[h:100px]:max-[100px]:font-bold\" />\r\n  <!-- or with `w:` -->\r\n  <div class=\"max-[h:100px]:max-[w:100px]:font-bold\" />\r\n  ```\r\n* only applied on screens taller and wider than `100px` (no conflict between `min-[w?:]` and `min-[h:]`)\r\n\r\n  ```html\r\n  <!-- without `w:` -->\r\n  <div class=\"min-[h:100px]:min-[100px]:font-bold\" />\r\n  <!-- or with `w:` -->\r\n  <div class=\"min-[h:100px]:min-[w:100px]:font-bold\" />\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Gotcha / usage note\r\n\r\nUsing `w:` is 100% optional and only exists so either dimension can be defined explicitly if the user so desires.

With the Tailwind plugin listed last in the `plugins` array (as instructed in the README), it still takes precedence over the sort plugin and effectively disables it.\r\n\r\nNotably, this only occurs when using a JS-based `prettier.config.js` file (where plugins are `require`'d) rather than a JSON-based `.prettierrc`.

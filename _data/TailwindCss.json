{"Data":{"TailwindCss-Issues":{"Issues":[{"Id":"2228527782","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-05T17:48:01","Actor":"adamwathan","Number":"13459","RawContent":null,"Title":"Don't accommodate hidden elements in space/divide","State":"open","Body":"This PR changes the implementation of the `space-*` and `divide-*` utilities to use a different selector, and apply the \"between\" styling to the first/left element instead of the last/right element:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- .space-y-4 > :not([hidden]) ~ :not([hidden]) {\r\n+ .space-y-4 > :not(:last-child) {\r\n-   margin-top: 1rem;\r\n+   margin-bottom: 1rem;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a small breaking change, specifically when the very last child of an element has the `hidden` attribute:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<ul class=\"space-y-4\">\r\n  <li>One</li>\r\n  <li>Two</li>\r\n  <li>Three</li>\r\n  <li hidden>Hidden</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, the \"Three\" element would have no space below it, but with this new implementation it does. I suspect this change will impact almost nobody though, because in all of the real-world scenarios I've explored, hidden elements are never the very last element. They are almost always the very first element, or first few elements, and in those situations this new implementation has the same behavior as the old implementation.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe \"between\" styling that we do with `space-*` and `divide-*` is most commonly achieved in CSS with the \"lobotomized owl selector\", like this:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.space-y-4 > * + * {\r\n  margin-top: 1rem;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur implementation in Tailwind though has always used selectors that look like this:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.space-y-4 > :not([hidden]) ~ :not([hidden]) {\r\n  margin-top: 1rem;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPretty much the only reason we did this was so that you could use these utilities with [`x-for` in Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/directives/for)\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<ul class=\"space-y-4\" x-data=\"{ colors: ['Red', 'Orange', 'Yellow'] }\">\r\n  <template x-for=\"color in colors\">\r\n    <li x-text=\"color\"></li>\r\n  </template>\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlpine leaves that `<template>` tag in the DOM, which means the first `<li>` is actually the second child of the `<ul>`, and receives the \"between\" styling even when it shouldn't:\r\n\r\nhttps://play.tailwindcss.com/7q6MiKZnRg\r\n\r\nBy using the implementation we've used up until now, Alpine users could throw the `hidden` attribute on their `<template>` element and now the \"between\" styling would only show up where it's supposed to:\r\n\r\nhttps://play.tailwindcss.com/p6ZGpSw1zt\r\n\r\nThe problem is on pages with a lot of DOM nodes, the selector we use is _fucking_ slow 😄\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/cramforce/status/1774847095171862943\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/4323180/2e7c3f55-d475-41ef-9029-60102861d65b)\r\n\r\nIt's not just \"technically slow but you can't actually tell because it's still fast\" either — if you have a really big list or table or something it's very, very noticeable:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/13445\r\n\r\nThe new implementation introduced in this PR is almost 2000x faster, getting things back down to \"feels as fast as any other normal selector\" speeds.\r\n\r\nOne nice benefit of the new implementation is that you don't need to use the `hidden` attribute on `template` tags anymore — the \"between\" styling just works as expected without it because the `template` tag is receiving a `margin-bottom` for example but the entire element is hidden so that margin isn't actually rendered in the browser anyways.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/13459","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Don't accommodate hidden elements in space/divide\" (#13459)"},{"Id":"2228220250","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-05T15:05:26","Actor":"The-Code-Monkey","Number":"13458","RawContent":null,"Title":"[V4] - @keyframes not being hoisted into built css","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

The only solution I've found here is to _not_ reference the `--shadow-sm` variable in the `.shadow-sm` class, to make sure the value of `--tw-shadow-color` on the current element is respected, rather than looking for the value of `--tw-shadow-color` where `--shadow-sm` is defined:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n  :root {\r\n    --shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px 0 var(--tw-shadow-color, black);\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  .shadow-sm {\r\n-   box-shadow: var(--shadow-sm, 0 1px 2px 0 var(--tw-shadow-color, black));\r\n+   box-shadow: 0 1px 2px 0 var(--tw-shadow-color, black);\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  .shadow-blue {\r\n    --tw-shadow-color: blue;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is pretty unfortunate because now our box shadow utilities behave subtly differently than every other utility in the framework. I'm hoping we can find some trick to make these variables lazily evaluated, and [tweeted about it](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1775937299919859961) in case someone else out there has any ideas.\r\n\r\nFor now though we should merge this to effectively selectively revert https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/13177 for the affected utilities.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/13449","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Don't read variables for shadow sizes\" (#13449)"},{"Id":"2225797897","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-04T15:43:02","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"13448","RawContent":null,"Title":"Prepare next release: `4.0.0-alpha.12`","State":"closed","Body":"This PR prepares the release of `4.0.0-alpha.12`\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

The ones I've noticed thus far are:\r\n\r\n- space-x utilities\r\n- border utilities\r\n\r\nThis is because Firefox v124 [does not yet support the @property rule](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_at-rules_property), and thus several CSS custom properties are left undefined.\r\n\r\nConsequently, styles like space-x-_ and border-_ are not applied in Firefox v124.\r\n\r\nThe properties are set by Tailwind v4 like using @property rule like:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@property --tw-space-x-reverse {\r\n  syntax: \"<number>\";\r\n  inherits: false;\r\n  initial-value: 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis currently results in code like the following that uses the undefined custom props without a fallback value:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.space-x-8 {\r\n  :where(& > :not([hidden]) ~ :not([hidden])) {\r\n    margin-inline-end: calc(var(--spacing-8, 2rem) * var(--tw-space-x-reverse));\r\n    margin-inline-start: calc(var(--spacing-8, 2rem) * calc(1 - var(--tw-space-x-reverse)));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe most straightforward solution is to add the appropriate fallback values to the custom properties where they are used, unless there are compelling reasons not to do this, e.g., for performance or safety. For example, the above code could be modified to:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.space-x-8 {\r\n  :where(& > :not([hidden]) ~ :not([hidden])) {\r\n    margin-inline-end: calc(var(--spacing-8, 2rem) * var(--tw-space-x-reverse, 0));\r\n    margin-inline-start: calc(var(--spacing-8, 2rem) * calc(1 - var(--tw-space-x-reverse, 0)));\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee also cases where the `--tw-border-style` is used. There should also be a fallback to `solid`:\r\n\r\nCurrent:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  .border {\r\n    border-style: var(--tw-border-style);\r\n    border-width: 1px;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuggested:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  .border {\r\n    border-style: var(--tw-border-style, solid);\r\n    border-width: 1px;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis demo can be viewed at:\r\nhttps://jdlien.com/tailwindv4-missing-custom-props/","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13435","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"In Firefox v124, some styles fail to apply due to missing fallback values for custom properties.\" (#13435)"},{"Id":"2216780851","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-02T20:43:37","Actor":"ottomated","Number":"13415","RawContent":null,"Title":"Speed up segmentation","State":"closed","Body":"Saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1767937096214257837) and wanted to pitch in.

The only place it would have mattered previously is border styles, but now that we don't actually rely on Preflight in order to set `border-style` when adding a `border-*` utility, this will work fine anyways. Even if it didn't, it would be a better trade off to have to add `first-letter:border-solid` when necessary vs. dealing with the side-effects I've mentioned of touching that pseudo-element.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/13408","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Don't reset ::first-letter in Preflight\" (#13408)"},{"Id":"2216138276","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-30T12:06:54","Actor":"mdillgen","Number":"13405","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] ::first-letter reset causes inaccurate text selection","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

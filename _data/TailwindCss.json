E.g.:\r\n```slim\r\np.flex.px-2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese candidates are not properly extracted because there are no bounding characters like quotes. To solve this, we pre-process it and replace `.` with ` ` characters. This results in something like:\r\n```\r\np flex px-2\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this has some challenges on its own. Candidates like `px-2.5` cannot be written in this shorthand form, instead they need to be in strings. Now we _cannot_ replace the `.` because otherwise we would change `px-2.5` to `px-2 5` which is wrong.\r\n\r\nThe next problem is that we need to know when they are in a \"string\". This has another set of problems because these templating languages allow you to write normal text that will eventually be the contents of the HTML tags.\r\n\r\n```haml\r\n.text-red-500.text-3xl\r\n  | This text can't should be red\r\n                 ^ Wait, is this the start of a string now???\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, if we consider the `'` the start of a string, when it's clearly not, how would we know it's for _sure_ not a string?\r\n\r\nThis ended up as a bit of a rabbit hole, but we came up with another approach entirely if we think about the original problem we want to solve which is when do we change `.` to ` ` characters.\r\n\r\nOne of the rules in our current extractor is that a `.` has to be between 2 numbers. Which works great in a scenario like: `px-2.5`. However, if you look at Haml or Slim syntax, this is also allowed:\r\n\r\n```slim\r\np.bg-red-500.2xl:flex\r\n           ^^^ Uh oh...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, a `.` is surrounded by numbers so we shouldn't replace it with a space. But as you can see, we clearly do... so we need another heuristic in this case.\r\n\r\nLuckily, one of the rules in Tailwind CSS is that a utility cannot start with a number, but a variant _can_. This means that if we see a scenario like `<digit>.<digit>` then we can just check if the value after the `.` is a valid variant or not.\r\n\r\nIn this case it is a valid variant so we _do_ want to replace the `.` with a ` ` even though we do have the `<digit>.<digit>` format.\r\n\r\n🥴\r\n\r\n# Test plan\r\n\r\n1.

In my Tailwind configuration (`tailwind.config.js`), I have extended the theme with custom colors and I expect utility classes like `bg-bglight` to be generated automatically. However, when I use `@apply bg-bglight;` in my global CSS file, I get the following error during build:\n\n```\nError: Cannot apply unknown utility class: bg-bglight\n```\n\nAdditionally, a default utility class like `w-3` is also not recognized in a similar scenario. My `tailwind.config.js` includes the following relevant configuration:\n\nThis is tailwind.config.js：\n```js\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\nmodule.exports = {\n    darkMode: 'class',\n    content: [\n      \"./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}\",\n      \"./src/**/*.{css}\"\n    ],\n    theme: {\n      screens: {\n        xs: '480px',\n        sm: '640px',\n        md: '768px',\n        lg: '1024px',\n        xl: '1440px',\n      },\n      fontFamily: {\n        sans: [\"var(--font-jost)\", \"sans-serif\"], // 匹配 Jost 的 CSS 变量\n      },     \n      extend: {\n        colors: {\n          // 基础背景色\n          bglight: \"#F6F6F6\", // 浅灰 backgroundLight\n          bgdark: \"#000000\",  // 纯黑 backgroundDark\n  \n          // 品牌主色系\n          brandAccentLight: \"#00739d\", // 辅助蓝\n          brandPrimary: \"#006DAE\",     // Monash 主蓝\n          brandAccentDark: \"#3c3c3c\",  // 深灰\n  \n          // 卡片系统\n          cardlight: \"#FFFFFF\", // 纯白\n          carddark: \"#505050\",  // 中灰\n  \n          // 功能色\n          functionalLight: \"#F6F6F6\",     // 浅灰\n          functionalAccent: \"#00739d\",    // 辅助蓝\n          functionalAccentDark: \"#3c3c3c\", // 深灰\n  \n          // 文字系统\n          textPrimary: \"#3c3c3c\",  // 深灰\n          textlight: \"#F6F6F6\", // 浅灰\n        },\n      },\n    },\n    plugins: [\n      require(\"@tailwindcss/typography\"),\n      require(\"@tailwindcss/forms\"),\n    ],\n  };\n  \n```\nThis is src/app/globals.css：\n```css\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n\n@layer base {\n  html {\n    @apply scroll-smooth overflow-y-scroll;\n  }\n\n  /* ===== 自定义滚动条 ===== */\n  /* 宽度 */\n  ::-webkit-scrollbar {\n    @apply w-[8rem]; /* 确保这个类存在 */\n  }\n\n  /* 轨道 */\n  ::-webkit-scrollbar-track {\n    @apply bg-bglight dark:bg-bgdark;\n  }\n\n  /* 滑块 */\n  ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {\n    @apply bg-[#d5d5d5] dark:bg-cardDark;\n  }\n\n  /* 滑块悬停 */\n  ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover {\n    @apply bg-[#b7b7b7] dark:bg-[#17222b];\n  }\n}\n\n@layer components {\n  .section {\n    @apply py-11 md:pt-16 lg:pt-20 px-4 sm:px-8 md:px-20 max-w-6xl mx-auto lg:min-h-[768px];\n  }\n  .section-heading {\n    @apply text-2xl md:text-3xl xl:text-4xl inline-block my-6 font-medium;\n  }\n  .link-outline {\n    @apply outline-marrsgreen dark:outline-carrigreen;\n  }\n  .link {\n    @apply outline-marrsgreen dark:outline-carrigreen text-marrsdark hover:text-marrsgreen dark:text-carrilight dark:hover:text-carrigreen;\n  }\n  .blog-main {\n    @apply mb-20 mt-16 min-h-[70vh];\n  }\n  .blog-section {\n    @apply py-8 px-4 sm:px-8 md:px-20 max-w-4xl mx-auto;\n  }\n  .glassmorphism {\n    @apply bg-clip-padding backdrop-filter backdrop-blur-xl bg-opacity-50 dark:bg-opacity-60;\n  }\n  .lower-glassmorphism {\n    @apply bg-opacity-50 dark:bg-opacity-60 after:backdrop-blur-xl after:w-full after:h-full after:absolute after:top-0 after:left-0 after:-z-10;\n  }\n}\n\n@layer utilities {\n  .swiper-padding {\n    padding: 0 3rem !important;\n    padding-bottom: 3rem !important;\n  }\n  .swiper-padding-mobile {\n    padding: 0 !important;\n    padding-bottom: 3rem !important;\n  }\n}\n\n/* Swiper 样式 */\n.swiper-pagination-bullet {\n  @apply dark:bg-gray-200;\n}\n.dark .swiper-pagination-bullet-active {\n  background-color: rgb(5 206 145) !important;\n}\n.swiper-pagination-bullet-active {\n  background-color: rgb(0 140 140) !important;\n}\n\n.swiper-button-prev,\n.swiper-button-next {\n  @apply dark:text-carrigreen;\n}\n.swiper-button-prev,\n.swiper-button-next {\n  color: rgb(0 140 140) !important;\n}\n@media only screen and (max-width: 480px) {\n  .swiper-button-prev,\n  .swiper-button-next {\n    display: none !important;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nthis is package.json:\n``` json\n{\n  \"name\": \"felix-blog\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"next dev --turbopack\",\n    \"build\": \"next build\",\n    \"start\": \"next start\",\n    \"lint\": \"next lint\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@tailwindcss/forms\": \"^0.5.0\",\n    \"@tailwindcss/line-clamp\": \"^0.3.1\",\n    \"@tailwindcss/typography\": \"^0.5.0\",\n    \"next\": \"15.2.1\",\n    \"react\": \"^19.0.0\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"^19.0.0\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@eslint/eslintrc\": \"^3\",\n    \"@tailwindcss/forms\": \"^0.5.10\",\n    \"@tailwindcss/postcss\": \"^4.0.12\",\n    \"@tailwindcss/typography\": \"^0.5.16\",\n    \"@types/node\": \"^20\",\n    \"@types/react\": \"^19\",\n    \"@types/react-dom\": \"^19\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.21\",\n    \"eslint\": \"^9\",\n    \"eslint-config-next\": \"15.2.1\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8.5.3\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^4.0.12\",\n    \"typescript\": \"^5\"\n  }\n}\n```\nI have verified that the `content` array includes all the paths for my source files.

This makes use of 2 custom properties `--tw-translate-x` and `--tw-translate-y`.\n\nWe have used the shadow-dom inside of custom element to prevent leakage of our CSS into another application we own. The project is legacy and I won't get into the reasons as to why we've done it unless necessary for the conversation.\n\nWe import a compiled tailwindCSS file into this custom element (we compile it via the standalone TailwindCLI) via a link tag in the shadow-dom.\n\nUtilizing any TailwindCSS translate utility (like `-translate-y-1/2` or `translate-x-2`) will omit any values not written explicitly.\n\nFor example take the following CSS\n\n```css\n.class-x {\n    @apply absolute top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 /* To center an element with absolute positioning */\n}\n```\n\nThe above code will result in the following CSS\n\n```css\n.class-x {\n   --tw-translate-y: calc(calc( 1/2 * 100%) * -1);\n   position: absolute;\n   top: 50%;\n   translate: var(--tw-translate-x) var(--tw-translate-y)\n}\n```\n\nAs the default behavior of custom properties, `--tw-translate-x` should default to `0` but instead we see that it is not defined when observed inside the custom element via the browser dev tools.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb705892-7061-4566-9fb9-e62333ff24f5)\n\nWhile this might be a browser behavior and not specifically related to tailwind, I feel it is worth mentioning as the only workarounds available are \n\n1. Explictly define the `translate-x-*` utility with a value\n2. Utilize Vanilla CSS and the `--spacing` utility.\n3. Utilize Vanilla CSS with raw CSS values\n\nThis will extend to classes applied on templates as well.\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17104","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"@property doesn't work with custom elements that use a shadow-dom\" (#17104)"},{"Id":"2905972438","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-10T11:45:36","Actor":"sharathdaniel","Number":"17096","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unexpected duplicate \"transition-timing-function\"","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

However, they can _also_ use CSS custom properties that point to another dashed ident.\n\nE.g.:\n\n```css\n.foo {\n  --target: --sidebar;\n  anchor-name: var(--target);\n}\n```\n\nA workaround that some people used is adding a `_` in front of the variable: `mt-[_--my-thing]` this way we don't automatically inject the `var(…)` around it. This is a workaround and gross.\n\nWhile the idea of automatic var injection is neat, this causes more trouble than it's worth. Adding `var(…)` explicitly is better.\n\nA side effect of this is that we can simplify the internals for the `candidate` data structure because we don't need to track `dashedIdent` separately anymore.\n\n\n<!--\n\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

E.g.:\r\n```css\r\n.foo {\r\n  anchor-name: --foo, --bar;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf they were separated by a space, then `[anchor-name:--foo_--bar]` would be a problem because it could both mean:\r\n- `--foo --bar`\r\n- `--foo_--bar`\r\n\r\n... because `_` values are valid in dashed idents.\r\n\r\nIf this ever becomes a problem, then we could special case `_--` to equal ` --` (notice the space).

MultiTool for Tailwind CSS ([github](https://github.com/brandonmcconnell/tailwindcss-multitool) | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss-multitool))\r\n\r\nMy MultiTool for Tailwind CSS plugin breaks when it contains a string including the `:` symbol, likely due to the parser terminating/splitting variants when it encounters the `:` symbol.\r\n\r\nI've done some testing, and this doesn't appear to be something my plugin can account for internally. If you look at the reproduction URL linked above ([also here](https://play.tailwindcss.com/T6ELlblWLw)), the first two lines receive the expected styles, but the last breaks entirely if it contains that character.\r\n\r\nThe problematic instances (those that contain `:`) don't appear to trigger the plugin and are likely seen as erroneous since, assuming my guesses here are correct, a usage like `multi-[underline;hover:font-bold]` would be split into `:multi-[underline;hover` and `font-bold]`.\r\n\r\nWith some slight tweaking to the parser, values could whitelist any instances of `:` within brackets.\r\n* current: `'a:b:[c:d]:e'` ➞ `['a', 'b', '[c', 'd]', 'e']`\r\n* desired: `'a:b:[c:d]:e'` ➞ `['a', 'b', '[c:d]', 'e']`\r\n\r\nIt's also important to note here that this was not always the case, or at least I am convinced it is not, as I include this example in the plugin's README, which worked when I tested it before including it in the README:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"sm:[&>div]:hover:active:multi-[font-bold;text-[red];[font-family:'Open_Sans',sans-serif]]\">\r\n  When hovered, this text will appear bold, red, and in Open Sans font.\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven a more `:`-riddled nested variant should be perfectly fine:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"hover:multi-[[&:is(*)]:focus:underline;[--some-var:{whatever}]]\">…</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. JS Tool for Tailwind CSS ([github](https://github.com/brandonmcconnell/tailwindcss-jstool) | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss-jstool))\r\n\r\nWithout rehashing many of the same points I did above, if you take a look at this Tailwind Play example linked above ([also here](https://play.tailwindcss.com/ZID1xrVAra)), you'll see many examples I use to showcase how JS can expose specific values to Tailwind CSS using plugins. Admittedly, I seldom use this one, but it is nice sometimes when I need to break glass and expose JSON values to CSS while testing. I could expose them as CSS variables alternatively, but it's helpful to have some means to directly interface with raw data like this, even if only used on occasion.\r\n\r\nHere are those same examples from the linked Tailwind Play example, all of which previously worked:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"before:js-[content-['fontSize.2xl_===_#{theme('fontSize.2xl')}']]\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"before:js-[content-['the_registered_config_keys_are_#{Object.keys(config()).join(',_')}']]\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"before:js-[content-['A_random_digit_is_#{randomDigit()}']]\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"js-[[--random-color:#{randomColor()}]] js-[[--random-color-2:#{randomColor()}]] text-[--random-color] font-semibold [text-shadow:1px_2px_0_var(--random-color-2)]\">Random_colors_ftw!</div>\r\n<div class=\"js-[[--random-length:#{randomRange(16,22)}px]] text-[length:--random-length]\">Random sizes too 🤯</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn both of these examples, I'm primarily addressing how these regressions limit plugin authors from achieving some of the powerful tasks plugins were formerly able to perform.\r\n\r\nBoth of these plugins may seem to operate unconventionally, but that's why they're plugins. This is part of what excites a community like this one—testing the limits of a technology like Tailwind CSS, finding various ways it can be extended to achieve different tasks, and ultimately building within those limits to make someone else's work easier.\r\n\r\nI've heard from real users of my plugins how my tools have improved their experience building with Tailwind CSS, and I would hate to discontinue some of them due to breaking changes.\r\n\r\nEven this past week, I've been prepping content for a blog post or video—perhaps both—on the powerful ways Tailwind CSS plugins supercharge the developer experience, demonstrating examples and providing a crash course on how to build effective plugins.\r\n\r\n\"The power of JavaScript in the simple and familiar form factor of Tailwind CSS utilities.\" (still bikeshedding the name)\r\n\r\nBecause many people primarily associate Tailwind CSS with CSS (for obvious reasons), they miss that with plugins, we can interject all sorts of sophisticated and useful functionality into our utilities. Plugins are essentially middleware that allow us to bridge the parser/compiler to our frontend in dynamic and performant ways, leveraging build-time processing.\r\n\r\nMany things that are not yet possible in pure CSS **_are_** possible with Tailwind CSS because of this JS processing, so it acts more like mixins and functions than just variable interpolation.\r\n\r\nThat said, it would be helpful to use examples like these to demonstrate the flexibility of Tailwind CSS plugins.

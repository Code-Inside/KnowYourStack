But I like to make the element full width on viewport `md`. The default value of `justify-content` is normally `justify-content: normal` (maybe differs on other browsers?). But there is no way to \"reset\" back to `normal` value.\r\n\r\nDo you have suggestions to solve my issue, or is this value missing from the core?\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nElement not full width: https://play.tailwindcss.com/pj23KKG5cV\r\nWhat I like to achieve/Expected behaviour: https://play.tailwindcss.com/oQ38fSUAsn\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nDavy\r\n\r\n_PS. I already tried to add `normal` to my config as an \"extend\" but didn't get it to work._</div>","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/10559","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Missing justify content \"normal\"\" (#10559)"},{"Id":"1580672567","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-11T12:55:39","Actor":"slyofzero","Number":"10557","RawContent":null,"Title":"Formatted string variables don't work as classnames when passed as an arbitrary value","State":"closed","Body":"I am currently using TailwindCSS version 3.2.4 in a NextJS 13 app, built using the command `npx create-next-app -e with-tailwindcss`. I have disabled the experimental features and am not using the NextJS 13 app directory and only working inside the traditional pages directory.\r\n\r\nI am using Node version 18.13.0 on Firefox on a Windows computer.\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL** - https://github.com/slyofzero/tailwind-issue\r\n\r\n---\r\nI was trying to apply tailwind classes to the children element by only adding class names to the parent in this manner.\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nconst paragraph = \"text-red-500\";\r\nconst section = `leading-8 [&>p]:${paragraph}`;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese variables are then passed as the `classname` property for any tag or component.\r\n\r\nI thought that this would apply red font color to all paragraphs inside a section tag but it doesn't, even though the developer tools show the `text-red-500` class on each paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe styles however are applied if we don't have any variables being passed as an arbitrary value or if we only have a formatted or a normal string as the classname. It just throws issues if the variable is passed as an arbitrary value.\r\n\r\n**What does work -**\r\n```tsx\r\nconst section = `leading-8 [&>p]:text-red-500`; //OR\r\nconst section = `leading-8 ${paragraph}`\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt'll be really handy if we this can be fixed/enabled as it'll help really with scoping.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/10557","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Formatted string variables don't work as classnames when passed as an arbitrary value\" (#10557)"},{"Id":"1580193923","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-10T20:43:29","Actor":"bagbag","Number":"10555","RawContent":null,"Title":"New classes not added when symlink is present","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

Added tailwind classes to index.html and app.component.ts\r\n2. Symlink: `ln -s ../../node_modules/@angular/core/README.md assets/README.md` \r\n\r\nNew tailwind classes are not added in `ng serve` without restarting it. Try to change `bg-red-500` to `bg-green-500` in `app.component.ts`. The sqaure will disappear as `bg-green-500` is not added to the css output.\r\n\r\nThis issue can be fixed by removing the symlink. Now class changes are added without restarting `ng serve` (may even require `rm -rf .angular`).\r\n\r\nIt does not matter what file type it is, the existence of a symlink is enough to break it.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/10555","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"New classes not added when symlink is present\" (#10555)"},{"Id":"1579019156","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-10T17:45:49","Actor":"vpcvdc","Number":"10551","RawContent":null,"Title":"Animation order not proper in Generated CSS","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

If you check out the [v3.1.8 sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/clever-jasper-t1t6q7), you can see that the last element inside `prose` keeps its `md:my-12` in big screens. But in the [v3.2.0 sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/kind-noether-zxdppk) the `md:my-12` gets overridden by `@tailwindcss/typography`'s styles. `@tailwindcss/typography`'s styles do not change between the versions. It's just the order in which they're injected changes (not 100% sure but I assume so).","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/10494","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"CSS injection order changed between 3.1.8 and 3.2.0 \" (#10494)"},{"Id":"1572756722","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-02-06T15:27:03","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"10505","RawContent":null,"Title":"Sort by `layer` inside `variants` layer","State":"closed","Body":"This PR fixes a sorting issue within the `variants` layer.\n\nWe currently have a whole system for sorting the utilties / components already.

However using Vite I'm getting a lot of errors and the only solution worked for me is to use configs as modules (basically `.mjs`). All configs are shown beyond\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. Install Laravel (Framework version 9.50.2)\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncomposer create-project laravel/laravel <directory-where-to-install>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.

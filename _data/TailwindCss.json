This PR also introduces `Discovering {path}` and `Reading {path}` logs.\r\n\r\n- `Discovering {path}` — this is logged when we are traversing the file system looking for files. We use the `ignore` crate, and log this information in the `filter_entry` callback. If a file was already ignored by `.gitignore` files, this won't show up, but it also means that we will not read it.\r\n- `Reading {path}` — this is when we are actually reading the file so we can start extracting potential Tailwind CSS classes.\r\n\r\nThese will give you some insights in what paths are being scanned, and if we get stuck, where we get stuck.\r\n\r\nAlso, we are appending to the file. In the log below, you can already see that a `tailwindcss-<number>.log` file exists already even though it didn't exist before running the command. This should make it easier to debug if we get stuck on a specific file/folder because the file will be populated with information.\r\n\r\nThere are a few reasons for appending to a file:\r\n1. There is a lot of output, so spamming the stdout/stderr is not ideal\r\n2. If you run the same command again, after changing your `@source` directives, you could diff the outputs. (although, the timestamps will be different)\r\n3. When using `DEBUG=*`, a lot of other tools also output debug information, so writing to a file should make this better.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary>Example

script before the Play CDN script.\nInclude the Tailwind Play CDN script (https://cdn.tailwindcss.com).\nCreate simple HTML elements with standard Tailwind utility classes and their dark: variants (e.g., bg-white dark:bg-black, bg-blue-300 dark:bg-blue-700).\nUse JavaScript to add/remove the dark class to/from the <html> element (e.g., via a button click).\nObserve the elements in the browser.\nExpected Behavior:\nWhen the dark class is present on the <html> element, the elements should render with their specified dark: variant styles. For instance, <body> should switch from bg-white to bg-black, and a div with bg-blue-300 dark:bg-blue-700 should switch to bg-blue-700.\nActual Behavior:\nThe elements do not change their appearance. They remain styled as per their non-prefixed utility classes (light mode styles). The dark: variants are ignored. Developer tools confirm the dark class is correctly toggled on the <html> element.

The issue appears to be related to how Tailwind processes files in a monorepo structure.\n\n### Current Setup\n\n1. **UI Package (`packages/ui`)**:\n   - Contains shared UI components and theme\n   - Has its own `tailwind.config.js` (tried as a workaround / fallback - also didn't fix the issue) and `postcss.config.mjs`\n   - Uses `@source` directives in `theme.css` to scan both app and UI components\n\n2. **Dashboard App (`apps/dashboard`)**:\n   - Next.js 15 application\n   - Imports UI package and theme\n   - Uses Turbopack for development and production builds\n\n### Attempted Solutions\n\n1. **Configuration Updates**:\n   - Updated to latest Tailwind v4.1.5\n   - Implemented recommended `@source` directives\n   - Configured proper content paths in `tailwind.config.js`\n   - Added `@config` directive in theme CSS\n\n2. **Build Process**:\n   - Verified proper CSS imports in app's `globals.css`\n   - Confirmed correct PostCSS configuration\n   - Checked for proper file scanning in development\n\n3. **Monorepo Structure**:\n   - Ensured proper workspace configuration\n   - Verified package dependencies\n   - Confirmed correct file paths in configurations\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nUtility classes should be generated and included in the production build, as they are in development.\n\n### Actual Behavior\n\nProduction build CSS only contains theme variables and base styles, but no utility classes (like `.bg-red-500`, `.text-white`, etc.).\n\n## Additional Context\n\nThis issue appears to be related to how Tailwind v4.1.5 processes files in a monorepo structure, particularly with the `@source` directive and file path resolution. The problem persists despite following all official documentation and best practices for Tailwind v4 monorepo setups.\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\ntbd\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- Similar issues reported in Tailwind CSS GitHub issues for monorepo setups\n- Potential connection to file path resolution in monorepo structures","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17904","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Tailwind utility classes not generated in monorepo\" (#17904)"},{"Id":"3043972250","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-06T21:09:47","Actor":"Malien","Number":"17903","RawContent":null,"Title":"HTML `Scanner` doesn't unmangle html escapes","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

I would expect `bg-1-1` and `bg-4-1-deep1` to work the same as the others.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\n1. Use the above config and CSS in a fresh Vite + Tailwind project.\n2. Run the build.\n3. Observe that classes for colors nested under key `1` are missing from the output CSS.\n\n**Expected behavior:**\n\nAll nested color keys, including those under `1`, should generate the corresponding utility classes.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17896","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Tailwind v4 does not generate color utility classes for nested color keys under `1`\" (#17896)"},{"Id":"3043293376","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-06T18:02:13","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"17898","RawContent":null,"Title":"Make upgrades faster","State":"closed","Body":"This PR fixes an issue where the upgrade tests were taking too long.

The expected CSS output should be `var(--my_variable)`.\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\n\n1.  **Utility Value:** When used directly as part of a utility (e.g., `p-(--x_x)`), the underscores are correctly preserved, resulting in `var(--x_x)`.\n2.  **Modifier Value:** When used as a modifier (e.g., `test/(--x_x)`), the underscores within the variable name are incorrectly replaced with spaces *before* being wrapped in `var()`, resulting in `var(--x x)`.\n\n**Possible Cause (Analysis):**\n\nThis seems related to the order of operations during parsing.\n*   For utilities `-(...)`, the variable context seems to be recognized *before* or *during* the call to the internal `decodeArbitraryValue` function, allowing its specific rule for preserving underscores within `var()` arguments or `--` names to take effect.\n*   For modifiers `/(...)`, the internal `parseModifier` function appears to call `decodeArbitraryValue` on the *raw* extracted content (`--x_x`) *first*, causing default underscore-to-space replacement. Only *after* this decoding step is the (now space-containing) result wrapped in `var()`.\n\nThis inconsistency makes the shorthand syntax unreliable when used within modifiers.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17888","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Invalid variable shorthand modifier replacement in modifiers\" (#17888)"},{"Id":"3041849405","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-06T13:32:48","Actor":"brandonmcconnell","Number":"17889","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix bug replacing modifier variable shorthand syntax underscores","State":"closed","Body":"Resolves #17888\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL:** https://play.tailwindcss.com/YvIekuzVRd\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n* Don't use `decodeArbitraryValue` when parsing variable shorthand syntax in modifiers\r\n  * replace `decodeArbitraryValue(modifier.slice(1, -1))` with `modifier.slice(1, -1)`\r\n  * added test case, passing ✅\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEdit by maintainer: \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where the arbitrary modifier shorthand (e.g.: `bg-red-500/(--my_variable)`) was incorrectly replacing the `_` with a ` ` (space). \r\nIt's important that we still decode the arbitrary value and replace `_` with ` ` in other situations.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have this:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"font-(family-name:--my_font,comic_sans_ms)\"></div>\r\n```\r\nYou would expect the following CSS:\r\n```css\r\n.font-\\(family-name\\:--foo\\,comic_sans_ms\\) {\r\n  font-family: var(--my_font,comic sans ms);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWhere the `_` in the variable is **not** replaced, but the `_` in the fallback value **is** being replaced.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17889","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix bug replacing modifier variable shorthand syntax underscores\" (#17889)"},{"Id":"3041384883","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-06T10:54:27","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"17887","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update turbo 2.5.0 → 2.5.2 (patch)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

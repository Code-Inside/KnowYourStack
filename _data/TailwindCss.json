But those types of tests aren't always properly separated.\r\n\r\nFor example if we are testing the concept of \"variants\" we use them with existing utilities. This is fine, but if we change something about the utility used in those tests then those tests start failing even though we didn't change anything about the variants logic itself. This happened before when we used utilities like `bg-red-500` and Lightning CSS started optimizing colors for us.\r\n\r\nWe did have a concept of the `basic usage test`-test where we tested some plugins usage and also the `kitchen sink test`-test where we tested the system as a whole (e.g.: various types of variants + utilities).\r\n\r\nA very nice thing about most of our tests is that they are considered integration or end-to-end tests which means that everything is tested using the public API and we also only assert against the final output. We treat the internal code as a black box. This allows us to refactor internal code without tests breaking (unless you broke the code while refactoring of course).\r\n\r\nThis PR will separate those tests (compiler vs built-in plugins), while simplifying those tests, while adding more coverage, and while adding some safety mechanism to ensure that we have tests for all the built-in plugins. Let's dig in.\r\n\r\n1. **Separating tests** — This PR introduces a `./tests/plugins/` folder that contains a test for each built-in plugin. For example you will find a `flex.test.js` file. The purpose of these tests is to check the actual output when using the utilities for these plugins. If you have custom logic depending on the kind of value you get via [arbitrary values](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#using-arbitrary-values) or based on configuration options, then you can test those here as well.\r\n\r\n1. **Simplifying those tests** — We also added `quickPluginTest` and `quickVariantPluginTest` helpers, you can think of these as macros for generating tests by reducing the actual boilerplate required to setup these tests. The helpers make use of some features (enabling specific [corePlugins](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration#core-plugins) and the [safelist](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration#safelisting-classes) feature) in the framework to generate all the known values for a certain component.\r\n\r\n1. **Adding more coverage** — The `quickPluginTest` helper generates output for all default values it knows about. If a plugin supports negative values, those are generated as well. This is made possible thanks to the `safelist` feature.\r\n\r\n   Making changes to the plugin, the plugin default values or internal changes that changes some of the output then the tests will fail and you will get notified. If you accidentally make a breaking change within the framework for a plugin then this should be covered as well. Since we are testing _all_ default values instead of a few examples in the `basic usage test` it means that we will have more coverage.\r\n\r\n   An additional feature is that we can now check the order of the generated CSS for a specific plugin. This can be useful if you have a set of known values from the config (configurable via your `tailwind.config.js` file), a set of hardcoded values (typically configured within the plugin) and a set of dynamic values (via the arbitrary values feature). This will expose where each generated CSS is located in the output.\r\n\r\n1. **Adding safety mechanisms** — This PR also adds a `./tests/plugins/index.test.js` test. The sole purpose of this test right now is to ensure that all `corePlugins` have a dedicated test file in the `./tests/plugins` folder. If a test for a plugin is missing then this test will fail.\r\n\r\n   Additionally, if you accidentally make a typo where you typed `backgroundColour.test.js` instead of `backgroundColor.test.js` then the test will fail as well because the `backgroundColor` will be missing and `backgroundColour.test.js` is a test that shouldn't be there. This would look like this in practice: \r\n<img width=\"1203\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/1834413/cbbc49b4-4f42-4c9c-9cac-755c97cdce89\">\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's important to keep in mind that the tests are end-to-end and they don't just test the output of a plugin by directly calling it and mocking the system, but it will run through the full system.\r\n\r\nThere are some tests that look like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// float.test.js\r\nimport { css, quickPluginTest } from \"../util/run\";\r\n\r\nquickPluginTest(\"float\").toMatchFormattedCss(css`\r\n  .float-right {\r\n    float: right;\r\n  }\r\n  .float-left {\r\n    float: left;\r\n  }\r\n  .float-none {\r\n    float: none;\r\n  }\r\n`);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// internal implementation\r\nexport const corePlugins = {\r\n  // ...\r\n  float: ({ addUtilities }) => {\r\n    addUtilities({\r\n      \".float-right\": { float: \"right\" },\r\n      \".float-left\": { float: \"left\" },\r\n      \".float-none\": { float: \"none\" },\r\n    });\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis feels like a stupid test where you basically type the same things twice. However, for other plugins it becomes more obvious that the internal system is doing additional mutations.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// example.test.js\r\nimport { css, quickPluginTest } from \"../util/run\";\r\n\r\nquickPluginTest(\"example\").toMatchFormattedCss(css`\r\n  .bg-primary {\r\n    background-color: #ff589e;\r\n    background-color: lab(64.0245% 80.6825 1.21577);\r\n  }\r\n`);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// internal implementation\r\nexport const corePlugins = {\r\n  // ...\r\n  example: ({ addUtilities }) => {\r\n    addUtilities({\r\n      \".bg-primary\": {\r\n        \"background-color\": \"oklch(71.7% 0.25 360)\",\r\n      },\r\n    });\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow it is more obvious that the system is doing things behind the scenes. In this case:\r\n\r\n1. The modern `oklch` color is converted to `lab`\r\n1. A fallback hex color is generated for older browsers\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

However, I encountered an issue while trying to import my component files after the @tailwind declaration.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the issue, I followed these steps:\r\n\r\n- Installed the \"postcss-import\" package using the command `npm install postcss-import`.\r\n- Created a main file to import my component files, following the example given in the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/using-with-preprocessors#build-time-imports).\r\n\r\nExpected behavior: I expected to be able to import my component files successfully after the @tailwind declaration.\r\n\r\nActual behavior: Despite following the documentation example precisely, I found that the imports after the @tailwind declaration were not working as expected. I am unable to import my component files.\r\n\r\n`12:05:55 AM [vite] Internal server error: [postcss] postcss-import: /Users/muhammadrizkia/Desktop/Projects/my-project/src/custom-components.css:1:1: `@layer components` is used but no matching `@tailwind components` directive is present.`\r\n\r\nPlease note that I have a basic understanding of Vue, Tailwind CSS, and using the command line interface. I believe this issue may be related to the order of imports or the configuration setup.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any guidance or assistance to resolve this issue.

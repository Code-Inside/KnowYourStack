The breaking changes are very light - a [node upgrade](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-load-config/blob/824a7de5f625310505504b2d79526ee8d608194f/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-changes-1) that drops support for versions of node that have been [unmaintained for a year minimum now](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases#release-schedule) [v5], and [requiring yaml users to install their own yaml dependency](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-load-config/blob/824a7de5f625310505504b2d79526ee8d608194f/CHANGELOG.md#breaking-changes) [v6].\r\n\r\nI see that unfortunately tailwind still supports old versions of node (14),\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/f65023efb97832660dc17cf954504f9f156047ba/package.json#L116\r\n\r\nso I guess this *is* a breaking change. In that case, may as well upgrade all the way to whatever latest is when the opportunity comes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor now, I will use commonjs and TypeScript, by using a .cts extension for the postcss config. This seems to work fine, but I know that for some reason in these configurations the postcss config file produces no warning if not present, however if present produces a seemingly related warning when running the app (`vite`) and loading the page.\r\n\r\n```\r\n(node:19428) Warning: To load an ES module, set \"type\": \"module\" in the package.json or use the .mjs extension.\r\n(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was hoping that just supporting ESM and TypeScript would make it go away.

The motivation for this is that we have seen time and time again that an incorrect config like `/**/*.js` can cause recursive scans through _all_ dependencies including many minified libraries which greatly impacts performance. \r\n\r\nIn #14140, we were adding two known-large directory names: \r\n\r\n- `node_modules` (used by npm)\r\n- `vendor` (used by PHP)\r\n\r\nThe problem with the `vendor` name though is that it is more generic than we would like it and there are legit use cases to have a folder named `vendor` inside your component folder. Additionally, PHP vendors behave a bit differently and it's not super common to have minified build files in that folder (which is one of the main reasons for the slow builds). Because of this, we decided to revert the change for `vendor` and only scan for `node_modules` going forward.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14147","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Don't warn about broad globs in vendor folders\" (#14147)"},{"Id":"2450672244","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-08T10:02:20","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"14133","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add `test.debug` to integration tests","State":"closed","Body":"While working on #14078, there were a couple of debugging  techniques that we were using quite frequently:\r\n\r\n- Being able to `cd` into the test setup\r\n- Seeing the stdio and stdout data in real-time (this currently requires us to mark a test as failing)\r\n- Checking the exact commands that are being run\r\n\r\nSince we naturally worked around this quite often, I decided to make this a first-level API with the introduction of a new `test.debug` flag.

E.g.: all of `node_modules`\r\n\r\nThis has been documented in the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration#pattern-recommendations), but it's still something that a lot of people run into.\r\n\r\nThis PR will try to detect those patterns and show a big warning to let you know if you may have done something wrong.\r\n\r\nWe will show a warning if all of these conditions are true:\r\n\r\n1. We detect `**` in the glob pattern\r\n2. _and_ you didn't explicitly use `node_modules` in the glob pattern\r\n3. _and_ we found files that include `node_modules` in the file path\r\n4. _and_ no other globs exist that explicitly match the found file\r\n\r\nWith these rules in place, the DX has nice trade-offs:\r\n\r\n1. Very simple projects (that don't even have a `node_modules` folder), can simply use `./**/*` because while resolving actual files we won't see files from `node_modules` and thus won't warn.\r\n2. If you use `./src/**` and you do have a `node_modules`, then we also won't complain (unless you have a `node_modules` folder in the `./src` folder).\r\n3. If you work with a 3rd party library that you want to make changes to. Using an explicit match like `./node_modules/my-package/**/*` is allowed because `node_modules` is explicitly mentioned.\r\n\r\nNote: this only shows a warning, it does not stop the process entirely. The warning will be show when the very first file in the `node_modules` is detected.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nðŸ‘‹ Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

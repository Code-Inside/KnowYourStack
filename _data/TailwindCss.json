However, I encountered an issue while trying to import my component files after the @tailwind declaration.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the issue, I followed these steps:\r\n\r\n- Installed the \"postcss-import\" package using the command `npm install postcss-import`.\r\n- Created a main file to import my component files, following the example given in the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/using-with-preprocessors#build-time-imports).\r\n\r\nExpected behavior: I expected to be able to import my component files successfully after the @tailwind declaration.\r\n\r\nActual behavior: Despite following the documentation example precisely, I found that the imports after the @tailwind declaration were not working as expected.

I believe this issue may be related to the order of imports or the configuration setup.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any guidance or assistance to resolve this issue.

The example provided is not functioning as expected. To demonstrate the problem, I have attached a video showcasing the issue.\r\n\r\n## Environment:\r\n\r\nBrowser: Brave Browser (version: [Please specify version])\r\nTailwind CSS version: v3.3.2\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the documentation page containing the example for sticky positioning.\r\n2. Observe that the sticky positioning element does not behave correctly.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior:\r\n\r\nThe sticky positioning element should stick to the specified position on the page as the user scrolls.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior:\r\nThe sticky positioning element does not stick to the specified position and behaves incorrectly when scrolling.\r\n\r\n## Attached Files:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/109217591/27b0b64f-2e2a-49ce-9da9-18902c0babe5","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/11509","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Bug]: Example of Sticky Positioning Element Not Working in Tailwind Docs\" (#11509)"},{"Id":"1779633119","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-29T13:49:54","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"11504","RawContent":null,"Title":"Sort classes using position of first matching rule","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss/issues/174\r\n\r\nGiven a list of components like this:\r\n```js\r\naddComponents({\r\n  '.foo': { display: 'block' },\r\n  '.foo-1': { display: 'block' },\r\n  '.bar': { display: 'block' },\r\n\r\n  // This rule matches both the utility `foo` and `bar`\r\n  // But when sorting `foo` — we've already got a\r\n  // position for `foo` so we should use it\r\n  '.bar .foo': { display: 'block' },\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the last rule matches both the utilities `foo` and `bar`.\r\n\r\nWhen sorting lists of classes we would iterate over all generated rules. Given that last rule matches both `foo` and `bar` it would win for any instance of `foo` used. This means that the utility `foo` would have a much \"later\" position than expected. For example, `foo-1 foo` would be sorted and stay as-is instead of becoming the expected `foo foo-1`.\r\n\r\nNow, given that we cache rules, the internal utility we used to match against them could be overwritten. As such, once you used `bar` the utility was permanently changed and no longer matched the utility `foo` causing the sort order to change for any list of classes _after_ the one that used the utility `bar`.\r\n\r\nAll that to say, given this HTML:\r\n\r\nWe would see the following HTML file as having sorted classes:\r\n```html\r\n<span class=\"foo-1 foo\"></span>\r\n<span class=\"bar\"></span>\r\n<span class=\"foo foo-2\"></span>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen in reality it should be this:\r\n```html\r\n<span class=\"foo foo-1\"></span>\r\n<span class=\"bar\"></span>\r\n<span class=\"foo foo-2\"></span>\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/11504","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Sort classes using position of first matching rule\" (#11504)"},{"Id":"1780651342","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-29T13:46:21","Actor":"wqcstrong","Number":"11507","RawContent":null,"Title":"less don't support arbitrary value about shadow","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

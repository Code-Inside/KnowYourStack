So in v4, we can introduce the use of both `:where()` in the child variant, and native `@layer` rules which will make it possible to override child variants with utilities the way you'd expect.\r\n\r\nWe originally resisted adding this feature because of this limitation and because we didn't know what the best solution for it would be, but now that the correct solution is clear we feel comfortable introducing this feature despite the limitation because the path forward will not require drastically re-imagining the API or how the feature should work.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/12551","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add `*` variant for targeting direct children\" (#12551)"},{"Id":"2033849728","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-09T14:02:11","Actor":"ivanpajon","Number":"12556","RawContent":null,"Title":"Nested Groups strange behavior with template literals","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\nFor example: v2.0.4\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\nFor example: PostCSS 8.4.30, React 18.2.0, NextJS 13.5.1, Typescript 5.2.2, Tailwind 3.3.5\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\nTested with v18.18.0 and v20.9.0\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\n\r\nChrome (latest)\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\n\r\nWindows 11\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\n\r\nReproduction working in Tailwind Play and plain HTML Elements:\r\nhttps://play.tailwindcss.com/sDDG7CrsNx\r\n\r\nReproduction of strange behavior in Stackblitz, using Tailwind in React components (NextJS framework):\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/tailwind-nested-groups-error?file=app%2Fpage.tsx\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nI am developing a recursive component to display menu options.

However, in the standalone CLI we provide our plugins already built-in. This becomes a problem because JITI uses a version of require that we were not patching to load the built in plugins.\r\n\r\nMaking this work is a bit more complicated than it seems at first glance and relies on an internal implementation detail of JITI. However, it's _probably_ one that's not subject to change too much (… famous last words — I know)\r\n\r\nBasically we now:\r\n- Patch `require` and `require.resolve` that's available natively to every module loaded by Node\r\n- Patch `createRequire` to return patched require + resolve functions that work the same way\r\n- Overload the JITI instance used so we can provide additional options that effectively instruct it to always use the \"native\" require to load the module rather than trying to find it on the filesystem\r\n\r\nFixes #12374","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/12506","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix loading of built-in plugins when using an ESM or TypeScript config with the Standalone CLI\" (#12506)"},{"Id":"2017548374","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-01T16:05:35","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"12508","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix source maps of variant utilities that come from an `@layer` rule","State":"closed","Body":"If you have a utility like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@layer utilities {\r\n  .foo {\r\n    color: red;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd your content contains `foo` or `hover:foo` then the generated CSS has correct source map information. However, in the case of a utility with a variant that generates an at-rule (e.g. `lg:foo`) we were incorrectly overwriting this information for all rules _inside_ the at-rule.\r\n\r\nNow, after this PR, these source locations are correctly preserved.\r\n\r\nFixes #12464","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/12508","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix source maps of variant utilities that come from an `@layer` rule\" (#12508)"},{"Id":"2019003901","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-01T15:44:08","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"12515","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix generation of utilities that use slashes in arbitrary modifiers","State":"closed","Body":"In utilities like `text-lg` you can specify a line-height / leading value by suffixing it with a config value or an arbitrary value.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"text-lg/4\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"text-lg/[4rem]\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"text-lg/[calc(4rem+12px)]\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, you couldn't use a `/` inside the arbitrary value like so:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"text-lg/[calc(6rem/5)]\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because we were looking for the `/` to split the utility at and we were finding the last `/` (that's next to the `6rem`).

This occurs because Heroku installs gems inside the project directory (`vendor/bundle`), which Tailwind then scans, encountering patterns like `{method}[rdoc-ref:Target#method!]` that contain `!` characters invalid as CSS tokens.\n\n## Environment\n\n- **Tailwind CSS**: v4 (via tailwindcss-rails 4.4.0)\n- **Ruby on Rails**: 8.1.1\n- **Platform**: Heroku (Ruby buildpack)\n- **Deployment**: Heroku uses `bundle install --path vendor/bundle --deployment`\n\n## Reproduction\n\n### Why it happens on Heroku but not locally:\n\n1. **Heroku**: Installs gems to `./vendor/bundle/ruby/3.4.0/gems/` (inside project)\n2. **Local**: Installs gems to system location like `~/.rbenv/versions/3.4.7/lib/ruby/gems/` (outside project)\n3. **Tailwind v4**: With `@import \"tailwindcss\";` and no explicit `@source` directives, recursively scans the current working directory\n4. **On Heroku**: Tailwind finds and scans vendor/bundle, including Rails framework source files\n5. **Locally**: Tailwind never sees gem files because they're outside the project directory\n\n### Specific warnings:\n\n```\nUnexpected token Delim(\"!\") at 1:14 in {*_will_change!}[rdoc-ref: #* will_change!]\n  Location: vendor/bundle/ruby/3.4.0/gems/activemodel-8.1.1/lib/active_model/dirty.rb:111\n\nUnexpected token Delim(\"!\") at 1:14 in {destroy!}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#destroy!]\n  Location: vendor/bundle/ruby/3.4.0/gems/activerecord-8.1.1/lib/active_record/errors.rb:169\n\nUnexpected token Delim(\"!\") at 1:14 in {save!}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#save!]\n  Location: vendor/bundle/ruby/3.4.0/gems/activerecord-8.1.1/lib/active_record/errors.rb:147 (+ 5 other files)\n\nUnexpected token Delim(\"!\") at 1:14 in {update_attribute!}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#update_attribute!]\n  Location: vendor/bundle/ruby/3.4.0/gems/activerecord-8.1.1/lib/active_record/errors.rb:148\n```\n\n### Example source code triggering warnings:\n\n```ruby\n# From activerecord-8.1.1/lib/active_record/errors.rb:147\n# Rails uses RDoc cross-reference syntax in inline documentation:\n# {ActiveRecord::Base#save!}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#save!]\n```\n\nThe `!` character is valid in Ruby method names but invalid as a CSS token.\n\n## Impact\n\n- ✅ Deployment succeeds\n- ✅ CSS builds correctly\n- ✅ Application functions normally\n- ⚠️ Build logs show 4 cosmetic warnings\n- ⚠️ No way to suppress warnings without modifying Rails framework source\n\n## Research Completed\n\nWe conducted comprehensive research and found:\n- ❌ No existing GitHub issues documenting this interaction\n- ❌ No Tailwind v4 CLI flags to suppress specific warnings\n- ❌ No way to exclude subdirectories in `vendor/` (Tailwind v4 removed v3 exclusion syntax)\n- ❌ `.gemrc` doesn't work (Bundler ignores it)\n- ❌ `@source` directives can't prevent scanning individual gem directories\n\n## Possible Solutions\n\n### 1. Add warning suppression options (Feature Request)\n\nAdd CLI flags or configuration to suppress warnings by:\n- File path patterns (e.g., `--suppress-warnings=\"vendor/**\"`)\n- Specific warning types (e.g., `--suppress=\"Unexpected token Delim\"`)\n\n### 2. Improve RDoc handling\n\nTailwind could recognize common documentation patterns like:\n- `{text}[rdoc-ref:Target]` (RDoc cross-references)\n- `{text}[rdoc-label:Label]` (RDoc labels)\n- And skip parsing them as CSS\n\n### 3. Better @source exclusion syntax\n\nRestore or enhance the ability to exclude paths from scanning:\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n@source \"app/**\" exclude \"vendor/**\";\n```\n\n### 4. Documentation\n\nDocument this edge case and recommended workarounds for Rails developers deploying to Heroku.\n\n## Current Workaround\n\nAccept the warnings as cosmetic. They indicate Tailwind correctly identified patterns it cannot parse, but don't affect functionality.\n\n## Related Context\n\n- **RDoc syntax**: Standard Ruby documentation format used throughout Rails framework\n- **Heroku deployment**: Common platform for Rails applications\n- **Rails 8.1.1**: Current stable release of Ruby on Rails\n- **Tailwind v4**: Latest major version with new CSS-first architecture\n\nThis appears to be an undocumented edge case - a novel interaction between Rails framework documentation conventions, Heroku's gem installation strategy, and Tailwind v4's content scanning behavior.\n\n## Questions\n\n1. Is there already a way to exclude specific directories from scanning that we missed?\n2. Would you accept a PR adding warning suppression options?\n3. Should this be documented as a known limitation?\n\nThank you for considering this issue. Happy to provide additional details or test proposed solutions.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/19239","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Tailwind v4 parsing warnings when scanning Rails gem source files on Heroku\" (#19239)"},{"Id":"3570946914","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-30T14:00:38","Actor":"jeremy-farrance","Number":"19236","RawContent":null,"Title":"CLI: Parse errors do not show filenames or line numbers","State":"open","Body":"Tw, @Tw/cli, etc: 4.1.16\nRollup 4.52.5\nNode: 22.21.1, npm/npx: 10.9.4\nOS: Windows 11\n\n```\n[6.33 sec] > npm start  \n\n> accutheme-tw4@2025.10.21 start\n> npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./src/tailwind/index.css -o ./dist/theme.css --watch\n\n≈ tailwindcss v4.1.16\n\nError: Invalid declaration: `*/`\n```\n\nI hope you will agree this should report the path/filename and line number.\n\nIt was simply this line in a .css file, but with zero details it took a while poking around to find.\n`/* margin-bottom: calc(var(--spacing) * 5); */ */`","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/19236","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"CLI: Parse errors do not show filenames or line numbers\" (#19236)"},{"Id":"3566914888","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-29T16:51:25","Actor":"TrueRyoB","Number":"19230","RawContent":null,"Title":"pd not working","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\nv4.1.16\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\nVite 7.1.12\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\nv22.18.0\n\n**What browser are you using?**\nMicrosoft Edge\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\nWindows\n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\nhttps://github.com/TrueRyoB/shukatsu-helper-gui/commit/98955ab5b159a9589a6b2ddfdd14b190c2a459fa\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\npx-[8px] and py-1 applied to the most outer <div> of AskBox.tsx is not effective.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/19230","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"pd not working\" (#19230)"},{"Id":"3565478674","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-29T11:51:50","Actor":"Copilot","Number":"19229","RawContent":null,"Title":"perf: Optimize hot paths in utility functions","State":"closed","Body":"Identified and eliminated performance bottlenecks in frequently-called utility functions during CSS processing.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n**String operations**\r\n- `isColor()`: Skip `toLowerCase()` when input contains no uppercase chars (most common case)\r\n- `convertUnderscoresToWhitespace()`: Early return when no underscores present\r\n- `allVariablesAreUsed()`: Replace RegExp creation in loop with string methods\r\n\r\n**Redundant checks**\r\n- `expandSequence()`: Remove duplicate numeric validation (already guaranteed by parent regex)\r\n- `hasMathFn()`: Avoid template string creation, check all occurrences not just first\r\n\r\n**Data structure improvements**\r\n- Replace equality chains with `Set.has()` in `isGenericName()`, `isAbsoluteSize()`, `isLineWidth()`, `isBackgroundPosition()`\r\n\r\nExample optimization:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Before: 13 equality checks\r\nfunction isGenericName(value: string): boolean {\r\n  return value === 'serif' || value === 'sans-serif' || /* ... 11 more */\r\n}\r\n\r\n// After: O(1) Set lookup\r\nconst GENERIC_NAMES = new Set(['serif', 'sans-serif', /* ... */])\r\nfunction isGenericName(value: string): boolean {\r\n  return GENERIC_NAMES.has(value)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Impact**: 11 functions optimized across 7 files.

So I installed `nvm` into the environment, and added `.nvmrc`, which is presently set to node v22.12.0.\n\nIn the repro IDX environment (above), run `npm run typecheck` (which is Astro's wrapper around `tsc`). The errors in `vitest.config.ts` and `astro.config.ts` are what's pertinent to this issue.\n\nThe errors will resolve if you run either of the following corrective workflows:\n\n```bash\nnpm rm tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite\nrm -rf node_modules/\nrm package-lock.json\nnpm i\n```\n\nThen, comment out `astro.config.ts` tailwind stuff before running type checking, like so:\n\n```js\n// import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  vite: {\n    // plugins: [tailwindcss()],\n  },\n});\n```\n\nThen run `npm run typecheck`. You'll see the `vitest.config.ts` type error inside Astro's Vite config is no longer there, after uninstalling `tailwindcss` and `@tailwindcss/vite`.\n\nSomething's up with Tailwind and Vite inside Astro!\n\n---\n\nAlternatively, instead of the above corrective workflow, you can downgrade node, like so:\n\n```bash\nnvm use 22.10.0 --save\nrm -rf node_modules/\nrm package-lock.json\nnpm i\nnpm run typecheck\n```\n\nUnfortunately, I need node greater than or equal to v22.12, so this is not an option!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/19210","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Tailwind Vite plugin in Astro causes type errors in Astro Vite config in Node >=22.12\" (#19210)"},{"Id":"3556036754","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-27T10:14:14","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"19216","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump Vitest to v4","State":"open","Body":"This PR bumps Vitest from v2 to v4.

I personally found it very difficult to know which values actually existed at the higher end of the scale without IntelliSense, and in practice even when working with a skilled designer like [Steve](https://x.com/steveschoger) who helped design Tailwind's default spacing scale, I'd very often need to break out of it to implement a design, and trying to round to a value that was in the scale made the design worse, not better.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows you to use any whole number, as well as decimal numbers that are multiples of `0.25` to ensure classes like `px-1.5` continue to work. While this means you can now technically do things like `pt-97.25`, I think the presence of the fractional value will be enough of a signal to developers that they are doing something a little unusual, and they can use their judgment as to whether they are making the right decision or not.\r\n\r\nI'll update this PR with a lot more detail when I have a chance, as there are a few other things to explain like:\r\n\r\n- Unifying all of the values for width/min-width/max-width/height/min-height/max-height utilities\r\n- Deriving numeric line-height values from the spacing multiplier instead of a separate line-height scale\r\n- Using `--spacing: initial` to disable the multiplier\r\n- How you can still use an explicit spacing scale and ignore this change\r\n- How we plan to use IntelliSense to surface a more curated set of spacing values even if smaller increments work when you type them explicitly","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14857","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Replace default explicit spacing scale with multiplier system\" (#14857)"},{"Id":"2629961856","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-01T22:26:59","Actor":"tremby","Number":"14856","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix config types for boxShadow","State":"open","Body":"`boxShadow` accepts multiple shadows just like `dropShadow` does.

and `inset-shadow` utilities","State":"open","Body":"This PR reworks the default `--shadow-*` and `--inset-shadow-*` scales to remove the bare `shadow` and `inset-shadow` utilities, and ensure every shadow has an explicit size as part of the utility name.\r\n\r\nHere's a complete list of changes:\r\n\r\n| v3                | v4 Alpha          | Proposed           |\r\n| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |\r\n| _N/A_             | `shadow-xs`       | `shadow-2xs`       |\r\n| `shadow-sm`       | `shadow-sm`       | `shadow-xs`        |\r\n| `shadow`          | `shadow`          | `shadow-sm`        |\r\n| `shadow-md`       | `shadow-md`       | `shadow-md`        |\r\n| `shadow-lg`       | `shadow-lg`       | `shadow-lg`        |\r\n| `shadow-xl`       | `shadow-xl`       | `shadow-xl`        |\r\n| _N/A_ | `inset-shadow-xs` | `inset-shadow-2xs` |\r\n| _N/A_ | `inset-shadow-sm` | `inset-shadow-xs`  |\r\n| `shadow-inner`    | `inset-shadow`    | `inset-shadow-sm`     |\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this change is just to make the scale more predictable ‚Äî it's never been intuitive to me that `shadow` sits in between `shadow-sm` and `shadow-md`.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't remove the ability to create classes like `shadow` and `inset-shadow` by adding bare `--shadow` and `--inset-shadow` theme variables, but does remove them from the default theme.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\nWe'll include a codemod for this in our upgrade tool to automate this change for people upgrading from v3 to v4, but this is still sort of an annoying breaking change admittedly and will make lots of educational resources, example components, and LLM tools out of date for v4 üòï At the same time I don't want to feel like we can never correct regrettable legacy decisions just to preserve backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nWe made a similar change like this when we went from the v0.x color palette to the v1.x color palette changing names like `bg-red` to `bg-red-500` and that proved to definitely be the right decision long term, so want to rip the band-aid off here too if we can.\r\n\r\nPlanning to make the same change for `rounded`, `drop-shadow`, and `blur` as well ‚Äî maybe in separate PRs but maybe just all in this one as well since I don't think we want to do one and not all.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14849","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Adjust shadow scales to remove `shadow` and `inset-shadow` utilities\"

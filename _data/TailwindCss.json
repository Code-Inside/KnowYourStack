However, our code that handles hoisting pseudo elements outside of `:is(‚Ä¶)` doesn't handle this properly when using `@apply`.\r\n\r\nGiven the following code:\r\n```css\r\n::-webkit-scrollbar-track {\r\n  @apply dark:bg-black;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou would end up with something like this:\r\n```css\r\n:is(.dark )::-webkit-scrollbar-track {\r\n  --tw-bg-opacity: 1;\r\n  background-color: rgb(0 0 0 / var(--tw-bg-opacity));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe selector above is is equivalent to `.dark::-webkit-scrollbar-track` which is incorrect. We want a selector that is equivalent to `.dark ::-webkit-scrollbar-track`.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the selector we define for dark mode to `&:is(.dark *)`. This is functionally equivalent to the previous selector and means we don't have to make any fixes inside `@apply`'s selector handling. As a result you'll end up with this CSS:\r\n```css\r\n:is(.dark *)::-webkit-scrollbar-track {\r\n  --tw-bg-opacity: 1;\r\n  background-color: rgb(0 0 0 / var(--tw-bg-opacity));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is equivalent to `.dark ::-webkit-scrollbar-track` and thus works as expected.\r\n\r\nFixes #13037\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/13379","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Change dark selector so `@apply` works correctly with pseudo elements\" (#13379)"},{"Id":"2210800074","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-27T13:30:36","Actor":"devcaeg","Number":"13378","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] TailwindCSS error in Vite: i?.waitForRequestsIdle is not a function","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

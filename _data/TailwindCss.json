And, when we encounter an arbitrary property we register it _at that time_ so that's the order it'll take when sorting. In most cases this is fine because we sort up front, however, in the Prettier plugin we don't know all classes up front — each individual class list is sorted separately but uses the same internal context for performance reasons. This means that we need to do some extra bookkeeping to ensure they're sorted consistently regardless of the order of individual class lists or files scanned.\r\n\r\nThis PR does this bookkeeping and will sort classes to ensure that the arbitrary properties are always alphabetical when handled by the prettier plugin even scross separate class lists or files.\r\n\r\nNow given these two files, a.jsx and b.jsx:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n// a.jsx\r\nexport default function ComponentA() {\r\n  return <div className=\"[--fg:#fff]\" />\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n// b.jsx\r\nexport default function ComponentB() {\r\n  return <div className=\"[--bg:#111] [--bg_hover:#000] [--fg:#fff]\" />\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you format each individual one with prettier or format all of them at one time the order of the properties will no longer flip-flop between these two lists:\r\n```\r\n[--bg:#111] [--bg_hover:#000] [--fg:#fff]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n[--fg:#fff] [--bg:#111] [--bg_hover:#000]\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/12911","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Sort arbitrary properties alphabetically across multiple class lists\" (#12911)"},{"Id":"2126885188","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-09T11:20:57","Actor":"pbrzosko","Number":"12908","RawContent":null,"Title":"No error when non existing class is used in Vue template","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

According to the Tailwind CSS documentation on [Configuration - Selector Strategy](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration#selector-strategy), I set a custom selector in my Tailwind configuration as follows:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  // Other configurations...\r\n  important: '#app',\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when attempting to apply styling based on sibling state as described in the documentation section on [Styling Based on Sibling State](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#styling-based-on-sibling-state), using the `peer` class does not work as expected.\r\n\r\n### Example HTML structure\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"app\">\r\n  <input type=\"text\" class=\"peer\">\r\n  <p class=\"hidden peer-focus:block\">I am visible if input gets focus</p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe paragraph (`<p>`) tag should become visible when the `<input>` element (marked with the `peer` class) receives focus, as per the Tailwind CSS `peer-focus` utility.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe `peer-focus` utility does not apply, and the paragraph remains hidden regardless of the `<input>` element's focus state.\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Set a custom selector in the Tailwind CSS configuration using the `important` property.\r\n2. Apply the `peer` class to an input element and the `peer-focus:block` utility to a sibling element.\r\n3. Focus on the input element and observe that the sibling element's visibility does not change as expected.\r\n\r\nThis issue suggests that there might be a conflict or a bug when using a custom selector in combination with the `peer` utility for styling based on sibling state.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/12907","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Bug with Custom Selector and Styling Based on Sibling State Using peer Not Working\" (#12907)"},{"Id":"2126597085","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-09T07:16:24","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"12906","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update rollup 4.9.5 → 4.9.6 (patch)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

While this approach offers certain advantages, it has limited browser compatibility, particularly on iPhone devices before September 2020. This can cause layout and rendering problems for users on these browsers.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution:**\r\n\r\nI propose replacing the `:where` selector with the `[dir=\"ltr\"]` selector. This alternative:\r\n\r\n- Offers broader browser compatibility, ensuring that the plugin functions correctly on all major browsers and devices, including older iPhones.\r\n- Maintains the desired functionality of providing LTR/RTL support.\r\n- Is generally considered a more widely supported and reliable approach for achieving bidirectionality.\r\n\r\n**Benefits:**\r\n\r\nBy adopting this change, we can:\r\n\r\n- **Improve user experience** for a wider range of users by ensuring consistent plugin functionality across different browsers and devices.\r\n- **Reduce potential bugs and support issues** related to browser compatibility.\r\n- **Align with standard practices** for achieving bidirectionality in CSS.\r\n\r\n**Testing:**\r\n\r\nI have thoroughly tested this change on various browsers and devices.  \r\nThese tests confirm that the `[dir=\"rtl\"]` selector functions as expected and addresses the compatibility issues associated with `:where`.\r\n\r\n**Request:**\r\n\r\nI kindly request that you review my proposed change and consider merging this pull request to improve the plugin's compatibility and user experience. I am confident that this modification will have a positive impact on the project and its users.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and consideration.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/12895","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix(corePlugins): more browser compatibility for rtl/ltr\" (#12895)"},{"Id":"2117336782","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-04T23:22:01","Actor":"Jonhyfun","Number":"12876","RawContent":null,"Title":"Group hover leaks when applying to SVG defs","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

[Prettier Plugin]","State":"open","Body":"### Discussed in https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/12804\r\n\r\n<div type='discussions-op-text'>\r\n\r\n<sup>Originally posted by **asimpletune** January 22, 2024</sup>\r\nOriginally I was going to write this in [the PR](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/pull/1362) for biomejs, but then I figured it's actually a tailwind-wide question.\r\n\r\nAs I understand, the [sort order](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier#how-classes-are-sorted) is based on the order of how class are generated  in the resulting CSS. I think this is a very good start, and handles most of what one wants. However with variants I don't think that is the case, and I'd like to explain why. \r\n\r\nThe best possible outcome of this discussion is I just realize  that I'm wrong (extremely likely possibility) and that's 100% ok with me, even preferred. If I'm wrong, then we can all sleep at night knowing we already do things the best we know how. However, there is the possibility that we do not currently have the best way of sorting classes, in which case there is room for improvement. So let's hope I'm wrong, as that is certainly easier, but not shy away from the discussion.\r\n\r\nOk, here goes. \r\n\r\n## The rules behind Tailwind's class ordering\r\n\r\nSo the plugin's ordering works by the order of the generated CSS. This is mostly very good. \r\n\r\nFirst, definitely, it is important to have classes that modify/override the same rules be sorted by specificity, so it's clear which takes precedence. The example from the docs of `p-4 pt-2` makes the case crystal clear, since `pt-2` is _more specific_ than `p-4`. The specific case _should_ override the generic case. \r\n\r\nBy that same logic, another way of expressing this rule is that **\"like goes with like\"**, and ties go to whichever is more specific. After all, what could be more alike than two classes modifying the same rule?\r\n\r\nAdditionally,  in the tailwind docs there is mention of a high level goal for the ordering as well:\r\n\r\n> The actual order of the different utilities is loosely based on the box model, and tries to put high impact classes that affect the layout at the beginning and decorative classes at the end, while also trying to keep related utilities together:\r\n\r\nThis also makes sense, with the most impactful, layout rules coming first, decorative ones coming last.\r\n\r\nThere's a third goal, which I'm just mentioning for completeness, that user defined classes come first. \r\n\r\nTherefore, according to the docs, we have 3 sorting rules: \r\n\r\n1. user defined classes\r\n2. layout first, then decoration\r\n3. like with like, with the more specific coming later\r\n\r\nOn all accounts, I am 100% in agreement and I think it all makes perfect sense. However, there is another rule, regarding modifiers that basically conflicts with the first 3! It's a complete contradiction. \r\n\r\n## The issue comes with modifiers \r\n\r\n> Modifiers like hover: and focus: are grouped together and sorted after any plain utilities\r\n\r\nThe problem is this violates the rules above. It basically, logically, means 'order by impact, ties are broken by specificity, ... but modifiers are immune from all of this and are tacked on in the end'. Why? \r\n\r\nLike I said, please don't mistake my meaning. This is better than nothing, but having the modifiers come at the end is honestly not useful. \r\n\r\nI understand that modifiers need to be distinguished from regular utility classes, that is clear, but it doesn't need to happen with sorting! I know something is a modifier by virtue of it having a modifier in the name. So, from this view, we're duplicating the benefits that we already get, which _on its own_ isn't harmful but it does beg the question:\r\n\r\n**Are there actively negative affects of distinguishing modifiers from utility classes by sorting?**\r\n\r\nThe downside of having it this way is we undo all the good we accomplished with our 3 sorting rules from above, because now I must read all of my styles to understand what they do. By this logic, we gain a benefit that we already had, but it comes at the price of losing other benefits, so by this view it's a net loss. I will try to make this last point more clear, before explaining how this 'net loss' is totally avoidable.\r\n\r\nSince modifiers come last, and a modifier can precede any utility class, that implies that I have to read _all_ of my code to understand the layout aspects, because they're no longer sorted earlier. Further more, I can no longer rely on the  \"like matches like\" rule, because there may be more \"alike\" that are hidden somewhere in whatever modifiers I have. \r\n\r\nEven worse, this is for every modifier as well too! It's not like there's an invisible line where  on one side is all the non-modifier stuff is sorted, and then on the other the modifier stuff is sorted. It's more like on the modifier side of the line, the 3 rules are respected but for each modifier! This means I MUST read every modifier to make sure nothing important was missed. In other words, I can't scan my code and rely upon the ordering to tell me what I need to know, because things aren't sorted anymore by impact or like with like.\r\n\r\nHowever, this problem is only important if you have a lot of modifiers. Most people probably don't, which is why I want to give a real, non-contrived example of what I think is a reasonable thing to make, that at times has unnecessary friction because of this:\r\n\r\n## 'Tabbed Window' example\r\n\r\nI made a  Mac-style [tabbed window](https://spenc.es/writing/how-to-create-toggle-menus-with-tailwindcss/#step-1-menu-layout-tabs) for displaying code that's all related in different tabs. I try to make everything I write work without requiring JS to function correctly, and I also optimize for browser reader modes. This means my markup is going to be a little bit more complicated than I'd like, and  I have to therefore use modifiers a lot. The end result is really cool, I think, and I love that in reader mode they're just normal document sections, complete with their tab's title being the section title. Here are some screenshots:\r\n\r\nNormal mode:\r\n<img width=\"825\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-22 at 3 40 22 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/2670813/14a772af-6099-403b-98c8-ee6c80a1172d\">\r\n\r\nAfter clicking the green button:\r\n<img width=\"1404\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-22 at 3 40 49 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/2670813/03dc1e86-0c9a-4a89-8cbd-d2aec550f9af\">\r\n\r\nAfter clicking the yellow button:\r\n<img width=\"892\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-22 at 3 41 04 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/2670813/09a939b6-43f3-4e4d-a0ff-60322f9d98bc\">\r\n\r\nThe end result is it basically works how you expect, but the logic is complicated. \r\n\r\nThe most important of that logic comes down to layout, as I want to expand the window if they press the expand button, or shrink if they want to minimize that example. This alone would be fine, because the layout isn't _that_ complicated after all, however I also have to handle the styling of the different tabs. \r\n\r\nWhen one tab is selected, I use a document fragment link (to that tab) in combination with some tailwind modifiers to make sure the expected thing happens with the tabs's styling. The default tab though has no document fragment link in the browser so it may not use any modifier at all. And things quickly become sort of a mess, as I'm sure you can understand. There's making sure the tabs background is lighter, its text is lighter, but the non-selected ones are respectively darker, and that when you hover over a tab it becomes medium levels of light. \r\n\r\nHaving a default that only applies to one tab, plus decoration that happens when one tab is selected, and separate decoration for everything if a tab is not selected, which the default tab must also adopt because it's not the default case any more is... very complicated. \r\n\r\nOk, so it's complicated, but my point is that the modifier sort order does not help. I have peers, I have groups, I have all sorts of stuff going on there. They all handle layout and decoration, but then those things also exist in the non-modifier area of the class list. I still think this is a cool thing to make, and I think it's not some extreme example of having crazy amounts of modifiers. The code still consists of totally readable, semantic HTML, and I barely had to write any CSS. \r\n\r\n## We already have the better way\r\n\r\nI want to thank whoever read all this way, and I don't want to end this without highlighting what I think would be a better way to do this. Therefore, I think the first 3 rules actually are great, and modifiers should just be forced to respect them.\r\n\r\n1. user defined classes\r\n2. layout first, then decoration (even if preceded by a modifier)\r\n3. like with like, with the more specific coming later (even if preceded by a modifier)\r\n\r\nThis actually makes a lot more sense to with how they work, since modifiers will already override competing rules of less specific stuff. I think the difficulty would be that it is just more complicated to implement, but that's a separate discussion. I'd like to know what other users and maintainers think. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading.</div>","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/12821","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Can we talk about the class sort order?

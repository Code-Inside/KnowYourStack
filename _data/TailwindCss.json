However, I've encountered an issue when using `next-pwa`—or more specifically, service workers—along with the new Tailwind setup.  \n\nWhen I export my Next.js configuration with `next-pwa`, it results in an infinite compilation loop, as shown below:  \n\n```\n✓ Compiled in 613ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 210ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 224ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 225ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 213ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 240ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 215ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 212ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 212ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 205ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 206ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 210ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 205ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 206ms (1705 modules)  \n...\n... and so on.\n```  \n\nHowever, if I export my Next.js config **without** `next-pwa` and do not register any service worker, everything works fine.  \n\nI dug deeper into this issue and found that when the service worker is enabled, removing the `global.css` file (which contains all the new Tailwind `@theme` directives and imports) from the root layout eliminates the problem. This suggests that there might be a conflict between service workers and the Tailwind PostCSS plugin when used together.  \n\n**Additional Notes:**  \n- I have tested this scenario with both `next-pwa` and `@serwist`, and the issue does not seem to be related to the tool used for generating the service worker.  \n\nAny insights or potential fixes would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16763","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Infinite Compile Loop When Using `next-pwa` (service worker) with TailwindCSS v4\" (#16763)"},{"Id":"2872939353","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-24T14:42:13","Actor":"jobcespedes","Number":"16752","RawContent":null,"Title":"Theme font-weight is lost if font-family is set","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

In non-shadow this is a non-issue since `@property` provides default values. However in shadow-dom `@property` does nothing, so ironically, in shadow-dom you will have no shadows on your dom.\n\nEssentially it seems there should be suitable fallbacks for any utils that currently rely on `@property` since it doesn't work in shadow-dom land.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16729","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[bug] box-shadow doesn't work in shadow-dom due to reliance on @property\" (#16729)"},{"Id":"2871309012","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-24T10:28:44","Actor":"tsboh","Number":"16748","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] space-{x,y}-* doesn't work (anymore) in combination with -m-0.5","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\nin v4.0.8 it doesn't work (anymore)\nin v3.4.17 does work\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\n\"dependencies\": {\n    \"@tailwindcss/vite\": \"^4.0.7\",\n    \"class-variance-authority\": \"^0.7.1\",\n    \"clsx\": \"^2.1.1\",\n    \"lucide-vue-next\": \"^0.475.0\",\n    \"radix-vue\": \"^1.9.15\",\n    \"reka-ui\": \"^2.0.0\",\n    \"tailwind-merge\": \"^3.0.1\",\n    \"tailwindcss-animate\": \"^1.0.7\",\n    \"vue\": \"^3.5.13\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@types/node\": \"^22.13.4\",\n    \"@vitejs/plugin-vue\": \"^5.2.1\",\n    \"@vue/tsconfig\": \"^0.7.0\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.20\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^4.0.7\",\n    \"typescript\": \"~5.7.2\",\n    \"vite\": \"^6.1.0\",\n    \"vue-tsc\": \"^2.2.0\"\n  }\n\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nv22.14.0\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nChrome: Version 133.0.6943.99 (Official Build) (x86_64)\nBrave: Version 1.75.178 Chromium: 133.0.6943.98 (Official Build) (x86_64)\nSafari: Version 18.3 (20620.2.4.11.5)\nFirefox: 135.0 (64-bit)\n\nin all these browsers, the issue shows up the same way\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nmacOS Sequoia 15.3.1\nIntel Core i9\n\n**Reproduction URL**\nhttps://play.tailwindcss.com/yTHsE1Wbew\n\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nAs you can see here in the preview pane, space-x-1 produces the proper white space between the items/blue circles:\n<img width=\"1164\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e449faa9-0595-4f3f-8a8e-3c573851d34b\" />\n\nAs you can see here in the preview pane, space-x-1 **does not** produces the proper white space between the items/blue circles anymore in tailwind v4:\n<img width=\"1167\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/808f7d5e-985b-4d42-8b76-e77282ad5b49\" />\n\nTo be clear: I just switched from version v3.4.17 to v4.0.8 in the dropdown, did nothing else\n\nThank you, and Cheers ","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16748","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[v4] space-{x,y}-* doesn't work (anymore) in combination with -m-0.5\" (#16748)"},{"Id":"2874310303","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-24T10:09:41","Actor":"syahz","Number":"16767","RawContent":null,"Title":"issues with Tailwind CSS Spacing in Next.js 15 (Missing Classes in globals.css)","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

(But not relevant.)\n- tailwind has been set up per instructions for ViteJS and main.css file has been included in the index.html file.\n- I modified the theme with custom background images.\n- Started a layout component for the tanstack root.\n- Started a menu component the default layout component with a `module.css` file.\n- I throw `@apply gap-2 p-2` from the default template into the primary class in the `PrimaryMenu.module.css` file and it errors.\n\nDebugging steps:\n- Verified that main.css file is included in the index.html file.\n- Tried excluding `.git` from my `.gitignore` file as recommend in #16669. This did not solve the issue.  \n- Tried hoisting node_modules and direct `@source` directives in the main.css file according to #16038.\n- Tried `@import 'tailwindcss';` in the `module.css` file. While this did load the general tailwind css set, it did not load a custom theme override.\n- Tried `@import 'tailwindcss' source('<path to src directory>');` in the `module.css` file. This did not work with the custom theme override.\n- Finally, `@import '../../../main.css';` solved the issue.\n\nI figured I'd make a separate issue because there didn't seem to be overlap.\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16728","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[bug] TW4 breaks module.css files\" (#16728)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-02-25T03:30:23.6440903Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":455}

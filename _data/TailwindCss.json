If the reason to use `box-shadow` instead of `outline` for the `ring` utility was the missing support for rounded elements, Tailwind could go back to `outline` because rounded elements are now supported.\n\n2.

Create a new Vite project: `pnpm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts`\n2. `cd my-app`\n3. Install Tailwind CSS and related dependencies: `pnpm add -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite`\n4. Initialize Tailwind CSS: `npx tailwindcss init` (this creates `tailwind.config.js`)\n5. Configure `tailwind.config.js`:\n   ```javascript\n   /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\n   export default {\n     content: [\n       \"./index.html\",\n       \"./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}\",\n     ],\n     theme: {\n       extend: {},\n     },\n     plugins: [],\n   }\n\n6. Update vite.config.ts to include the Tailwind CSS plugin:\n```javascript\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite'\nimport react from '@vitejs/plugin-react-swc'\nimport tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite' // Import the plugin\n\n// https://vite.dev/config/\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()], // Add the plugin\n})\n```\n7. Update `src/index.css` to include the Tailwind directive:\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n```\n8. Ensure src/main.tsx imports src/index.css.\n```javascript\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react'\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'\nimport './index.css'\nimport App from './App.tsx'\n\ncreateRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(\n  <StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </StrictMode>,\n)\n```\n9. Run the development server: `pnpm run dev --profile (or vite --profile)`\n[vite-profile-0.cpuprofile](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20116174/vite-profile-0.cpuprofile)\n10. Observe the long startup time.\n\n**Expected behavior** The Vite development server should start within a few seconds for a minimal starter project.\n\n**Actual behavior** The cold start takes 40+ seconds.\n\n**Environment:**\n\nOS: Linux (Debian GNU/Linux 12 bookworm in a dev container)\nNode.js version: v22.15.0\npnpm version: 10.10.0\nVite version: 6.3.5\n@tailwindcss/vite version: 4.1.5\ntailwindcss version: 4.1.5\n@vitejs/plugin-react-swc version: 3.9.0\n\n**Relevant Configuration Files:**\n\n[package.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20116184/package.json)\n\n**vite.config.ts:**\n```typescript\nimport tailwindcss from \"@tailwindcss/vite\";\nimport react from \"@vitejs/plugin-react-swc\";\n\nimport { defineConfig } from \"vite\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  server: {\n    host: true,\n  },\n  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],\n});\n```\n**tailwind.config.js**\n```javascript\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\nmodule.exports = {\n  content: [\n    './index.html', // For your root index.html\n    './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n  ],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {},\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n};\n```\n\n**Additional context** The project is running inside a dev container.

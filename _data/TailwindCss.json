The issue occurs with custom variants (like my implementation of `focus-visible`) as well as built-in variants like `hover:`.\n\n\nIntelliSense's hover preview does get it right though:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8ecb265-c5ff-46c7-95c6-7ad6d4fac34e)\n\n## Expected behavior\nBoth ordering approaches should work and apply the styles correctly, regardless of whether the variant is placed before or after the arbitrary selector.\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18387","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Modifier order issue: variants before arbitrary not selectors fail to apply styles\" (#18387)"},{"Id":"3171399247","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-24T16:50:31","Actor":"ekko2665","Number":"18379","RawContent":null,"Title":"tailwindCSS not being  work in some android mobile","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

While we understand these are precompiled performance tools, some transparency or build options would help dev teams avoid security flagging on production servers.\n\nWhen deploying a Laravel 11 project using Tailwind CSS (via @tailwindcss/oxide) on a production server running ImunifyAV malware scanning, several files in the node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-* directories are repeatedly flagged as malware.\n\nThe affected files are native .node binaries such as: \n\n```node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu/oxide.linux-x64-gnu.node```\n```node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-musl/oxide.linux-x64-musl.node```\n\n---\n\n ```httpdocs/node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-musl/tailwindcss-oxide.linux-x64-musl.node```\n ```httpdocs/node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu/tailwindcss-oxide.linux-x64-gnu.node```\n```httpdocs/node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu/oxide.linux-x64-gnu.node```\n```httpdocs/node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-musl/oxide.linux-x64-musl.node```\n```httpdocs/node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-musl/tailwindcss-oxide.linux-x64-musl.node```\n```httpdocs/node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu/tailwindcss-oxide.linux-x64-gnu.node```\n```httpdocs/node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-musl/oxide.linux-x64-musl.node```\n\n---\n\n🧨 Problem Summary\n\nThis isn’t just an issue with Tailwind’s JIT binaries (oxide). Rollup — the JavaScript bundler that many frontend frameworks use (including Vite, which Laravel 11 defaults to) — is also shipping native .node binaries that are being flagged as malware by ImunifyAV.\n\n---\n\n**My Concerns**\n\nDoes this make any websites that use this tailwind library to become vulnerable?  ImunifyAV is saying they contain malware. Is it a false positive? On my side I ran the scan about 8 times and it came back with the same thing each time. I have always used tailwind and it would be ashame to have to move away from it due to these security issues. \n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18366","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"According to imunifyAV this may contain malware\" (#18366)"},{"Id":"3164470054","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-21T19:40:11","Actor":"kilavvy","Number":"18361","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix: Correct typo in comment","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request contains a couple of minor documentation fixes.\r\n\r\n- Corrected a typo from `predicable` to `predictable` in a comment for `DarkModeStrategy`.\r\n- Applied minor formatting to a comment in a test file.\r\n\r\nThese changes help improve code clarity and maintainability.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18361","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix: Correct typo in comment\" (#18361)"},{"Id":"3165166324","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-21T15:37:51","Actor":"danielehrhardt","Number":"18363","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support Angular Scss with Tailwind 4","State":"closed","Body":"Support Angular Scss with Tailwind 4","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18363","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Support Angular Scss with Tailwind 4\" (#18363)"},{"Id":"3164028882","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-20T18:03:07","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"18360","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update eslint 9.27.0 → 9.29.0 (minor)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

For developers needing larger text sizes (e.g., in hero sections or landing pages), this required:\r\n\r\nUsing arbitrary values like text-[10rem], or Extending the Tailwind theme manually.\r\n\r\n### Change Introduced:\r\nI extended the default fontSize scale by adding new named utilities:\r\ntext-10xl through text-20xl, with increasing rem values (10rem to 20rem).\r\n\r\n- This allows users to scale typography in a consistent and semantic way without relying on custom values.\r\n- Removes the need to use arbitrary utilities or manually extend the theme.\r\n- Keeps the utility-first philosophy intact.\r\n- Makes Tailwind more robust and production-ready for large text use cases such as:\r\n\r\n-           Hero headlines\r\n-           Promo banners\r\n-           Display typography in dashboards\r\n\r\nNow developers can simply write text-12xl or text-16xl directly in their markup, without touching tailwind.config.js.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\n### 🧪 How I Tested the Changes\r\nMade the Changes in defaultTheme.js\r\nI added the following entries:\r\n\r\njs\r\n\r\n      '10xl': '10rem',\r\n      '11xl': '11rem',\r\n      '12xl': '12rem',\r\n      '13xl': '13rem',\r\n      '14xl': '14rem',\r\n      '15xl': '15rem',\r\n      '16xl': '16rem',\r\n      '17xl': '17rem',\r\n      '18xl': '18rem',\r\n      '19xl': '19rem',\r\n      '20xl': '20rem',\r\nBuilt the Package\r\nInside the root of the Tailwind repo:\r\n\r\nbash\r\n\r\n      pnpm build\r\n\r\nLinked Locally for Testing\r\n\r\nI linked the local build to a test React project using:\r\n\r\n\r\n      pnpm link --global\r\n# Then inside the test project:\r\n      pnpm link tailwindcss\r\nTested in a React App\r\nIn the test app, I added:\r\n\r\n\r\n      <h1 class=\"text-14xl font-bold text-blue-600\">Massive Text</h1>\r\n✅ Verified that the class was generated correctly in the compiled CSS and rendered properly in the browser.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18351","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Added text-10xl to text-20xl Font Size Utilities\" (#18351)"},{"Id":"3161317927","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-19T21:13:21","Actor":"JoannaBraccini","Number":"18349","RawContent":null,"Title":"Tailwind CSS executable missing on Windows 11 for versions above 3.4.17","State":"closed","Body":"**Description:**\nI'm experiencing an issue with Tailwind CSS versions above 3.4.17 on Windows 11.

The strategy is this:\r\n- Strings begin with a `\"` and ends with an unescaped `\"`. Consume everything between these delimiters (existing case).\r\n- Keywords begin with `:`, and end with whitespace, or one out of a small set of specific reserved characters. Everything else is a valid character in a keyword. Consume everything between these delimiters, and apply the class splitting previously contained in the outer loop.

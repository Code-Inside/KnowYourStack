To make this work, I also had to move things around a bit (so you might want to check this PR commit by commit). I also solved an issue by restructuring the code.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nFor starters, we barely applied any caching when migrating candidates from α to β. The problem with this is that in big projects the same candidates will appear _everywhere_, so caching is going to be useful here.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why we didn't do any caching is that some migrations were checking if a migration is actually safe to do. To do this, we were checking the `location` (the location of the candidate in the template). Since this location is unique for each template, caching was not possible.\r\n\r\nSo the first order of business was to hoist the `isSafeMigration` check up as the very first thing we do in the migration.\r\n\r\nIf we do this first, then the only remaining code relies on the `DesignSystem`, `UserConfig` and `rawCandidate`. \r\n\r\nIn a project, the `DesignSystem` and `UserConfig` will be the same during the migration, only the `rawCandidate` will be different which means that we can move all this logic in a good old `DefaultMap` and cache the heck out of it. \r\n\r\nRunning the numbers on our Tailwind Plus repo, this results in:\r\n```\r\n    Total seen candidates: 2 211 844\r\nTotal migrated candidates: 7 775 \r\n               Cache hits: 1 575 700\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's a lot of work we _don't_ have to do. Looking at the timings, the template migration step goes from ~45s to ~10s because of this.\r\n\r\nAnother big benefit of this is that this makes migrations _actually_ safe. Before we were checking if a migration was safe to do in specific migrations. But other migrations were still printing the candidate which could still result in an unsafe migration.\r\n\r\nFor example when migrating the `blur` and the `shadow` classes, the `isSafeMigration` was used. But if the input was `!flex` then the safety check wasn't even checked in this specific migration.\r\n\r\n### Safe migrations\r\n\r\nAlso made some changes to the `isSafeMigration` logic itself. We used to start by checking the location, but thinking about the problem again, the actual big problem we were running into is classes that are short like `blur`, and `shadow` because they could be used in other contexts than a Tailwind CSS class.\r\n\r\nInverting this logic means that more specific Tailwind CSS classes will very likely _not_ cause any issues at all. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n- If you have variants: `hover:focus:flex`\r\n- If you have arbitrary properties: `[color:red]`\r\n- If you have arbitrary values: `bg-[red]`\r\n- If you have a modifier: `bg-red-500/50`\r\n- If you have a `-` in the name: `bg-red-500`\r\n\r\nEven better if we can't parse a candidate at all, we can skip the migrations all together.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the issue in #17974, one of the issues was already solved by just hoisting the `isSafeMigration`. But to make the issue was completely solved I also made sure that in Vue attributes like `:active=\"…\"` are also considered unsafe (note: `:class` is allowed).\r\n\r\nLast but not least, in case of the `!duration` that got replaced with `duration!` was solved by verifying that the candidate actually produces valid CSS. We can compute the signature for this class.\r\n\r\nThe reason this wasn't thrown away earlier is because we can correctly parse `duration` but `duration` on its own doesn't exist, `duration-<number>` does exist as a functional utility which is why it parsed in the first place.\r\n\r\nFixes: #17974\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\n1. Ran the tool on our Tailwind UI Templates repo to compare the new output with the \"old\" behavior and there were no differences in output.\r\n2. Ran the tool on our Tailwind Plus repo, and the template migration step went from ~45s to ~10s.\r\n3. Added additional tests to verify the issues in #17974 are fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[ci-all] let's run this on all CI platforms...","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18025","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Make candidate template migrations faster\" (#18025)"},{"Id":"3065851880","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-15T11:16:03","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"18037","RawContent":null,"Title":"Upgrade lightningcss to `1.30.1`","State":"closed","Body":"Changelog: https://github.com/parcel-bundler/lightningcss/releases/tag/v1.30.1","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18037","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Upgrade lightningcss to `1.30.1`\" (#18037)"},{"Id":"3063228667","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-15T11:00:00","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"18020","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ignore custom variants with `:merge(…)` selectors","State":"closed","Body":"Closes #15617\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR ignores `addVariant(…)` legacy JS plugin calls for variants that are using the [`:merge(…)` selector](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins#parent-and-sibling-states) for parent and sibling states.

If there’s a space between the property name and value inline, it doesn’t work, but in `@theme`, it’s fine either way. It’s been pretty confusing.\n\nFor example, in the following code:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"[--gap:40px] flex flex-col gap-[--gap]\">\n  <div class=\"size-5 bg-red-500\"></div>\n  <div class=\"size-5 bg-green-500\"></div>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe above works as expected. However, introducing a space in the declaration, like so:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"[--gap: 40px] flex flex-col gap-[--gap]\">\n```\n\ncauses the variable to no longer be recognized.\n\nThis behavior is inconsistent with `@theme` declarations, where both of the following work identically:\n\n```css\n@theme {\n  --gap:40px;\n}\n\n@theme {\n  --gap: 40px;\n}\n```\n\nIt would be helpful if the space between the property name and value in the inline context is made insignificant to align with the standard CSS variable syntax and avoid potential confusion.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18032","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Space sensitivity in inline variable declarations\" (#18032)"},{"Id":"3064941413","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-15T07:08:00","Actor":"djlguzman","Number":"18028","RawContent":null,"Title":"nested list marker: specificity is not followed properly","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

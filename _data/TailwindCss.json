This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as cropped descenders when using `truncate`.\r\n\r\nThis issue is present on macOS with `text-5xl` and larger, while on Windows, it happens at text sizes `text-3xl` and larger. The reason for this, as far as I can tell, is the difference in the default font on the platforms, where Segoe UI requires a bigger line height than SF NS. In my case, I was able to fix this issue with using `leading-normal` (`line-height: 1.5`), but I assume there is a good reason it's set to `1` on the larger font sizes and the rem sizes for the smaller ones.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13293","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"System fonts at bigger sizes have too narrow line heights\" (#13293)"},{"Id":"2198269322","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-20T20:40:50","Actor":"KrisBraun","Number":"13291","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use Vite waitForRequestsIdle","State":"closed","Body":"Use Vite [waitForRequestIdle](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/commit/9888843) instead of our custom `setTimeout` back.

This way you always get the arbitrary values as-is without anything else.\r\n\r\nWe also move the `skewX` and `skewY` functions into the `--tw-skew-x` and `--tw-skew-y` variables themselves, because otherwise it could happen that the variable is not defined and then we use `skewX(--variable-that-is-not-defined)`.\r\n\r\nBy doing that, we also updated the `transform-cpu` and `transform-gpu` to use the `--tw-skew-x` and `--tw-skew-y` variables that already include the `skewX` and `skewY` functions. We also use the `var(--tw-skew-x,)` value (with the dangling comma) to ensure the full `transform` property is valid. \r\n\r\nNotice how the `,` is important:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/1834413/01895880-427b-407f-9e11-6765f6ca8dbf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nüëã Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

The CSS variables used in `transform`, `translate` and so forth are partially undefined in Firefox, rendering the entire rule without effect.\r\n\r\nIn the example above, the `<p>` should be translated by 2rem to the right, using `transform translate-x-8`. This works in Chrome and Safari as previously in < 4.0.0, because `translate-x-*` expands to two rules, one for setting `--tw-translate-x` and one for rendering\r\n\r\n```css\r\ntransform: translate(var(--tw-translate-x),var(--tw-translate-y)) rotate(var(--tw-rotate)) skewX(var(--tw-skew-x)) skewY(var(--tw-skew-y)) scaleX(var(--tw-scale-x)) scaleY(var(--tw-scale-y));\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the rest of the variables are defaulted from the preflight settings.\r\n\r\nIn v4, these are set via CSS's `@property` rules with appropriate defaults, but those at-rules are not yet supported in mainline Firefox. `translate-x-*` is also expanded into a singular rule, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.translate-x-8 {\r\n    --tw-translate-x: 3rem;\r\n    translate: var(--tw-translate-x) var(--tw-translate-y);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the undefinedness of --tw-translate-y breaks the property's effect. You can quickly fix this by adding\r\n\r\n```css\r\n--tw-translate-x: 0;\r\n--tw-translate-y: 0;\r\n--tw-rotate: 0;\r\n--tw-skew-x: 0;\r\n--tw-skew-y: 0;\r\n--tw-scale-x: 1;\r\n--tw-scale-y: 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nto your `@theme` block to default them at the root.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13268","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[v4] `transform` utilities not working in Firefox due to no support for `@property`\" (#13268)"},{"Id":"2190657699","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-17T13:00:43","Actor":"zoomoid","Number":"13267","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] `max-w-screen-*` utilities are not provided by default","State":"open","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\nv4.0.0-alpha.9\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\n@tailwindcss/postcss 4.0.0-alpha.9, Next.js 14.1.3\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\nv20.11.0\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\n\r\nChrome, Firefox, Safari\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\n\r\nmacOS\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\n\r\nClone the NextJS repo at <https://github.com/zoomoid/tailwindcss-4-experiments> and run the project in `missing-screen-widths`.

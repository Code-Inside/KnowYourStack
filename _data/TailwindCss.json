However, they can _also_ use CSS custom properties that point to another dashed ident.\n\nE.g.:\n\n```css\n.foo {\n  --target: --sidebar;\n  anchor-name: var(--target);\n}\n```\n\nA workaround that some people used is adding a `_` in front of the variable: `mt-[_--my-thing]` this way we don't automatically inject the `var(…)` around it. This is a workaround and gross.\n\nWhile the idea of automatic var injection is neat, this causes more trouble than it's worth. Adding `var(…)` explicitly is better.\n\nA side effect of this is that we can simplify the internals for the `candidate` data structure because we don't need to track `dashedIdent` separately anymore.\n\n\n<!--\n\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

E.g.:\r\n```css\r\n.foo {\r\n  anchor-name: --foo, --bar;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf they were separated by a space, then `[anchor-name:--foo_--bar]` would be a problem because it could both mean:\r\n- `--foo --bar`\r\n- `--foo_--bar`\r\n\r\n... because `_` values are valid in dashed idents.\r\n\r\nIf this ever becomes a problem, then we could special case `_--` to equal ` --` (notice the space). But that in turn would convert legitimate values that look like `--foo_--bar`. Not sure if this is a real problem, because properties such as `anchor-name` are comma-separated right now.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

However, once a number is reached the numbers are compared as actual numbers instead of their string representation.\r\n\r\nBefore this change, `p-1 p-2 p-10 p-20` would be sorted as `p-1 p-10 p-2 p-20`. After this change, the order is `p-1 p-2 p-10 p-20`.\r\n\r\nThis makes the suggestions in the vscode extension more logical.\r\n\r\nThe implementation compares two strings, and as long as the strings don't contain any numbers, it compares them as strings. This way we don't pay a performance penalty for comparing strings that don't contain numbers.\r\n\r\nTesting this change on the `tailwindcss.com` codebase where we have to store `~3200` unique classes the time spend on sorting the classes went from `~2.35ms` to ~~`~3.29ms`~~`~3.10ms`. This means that there is about a ~~`~1ms`~~`~0.75ms` performance penalty for sorting this.\r\n\r\nAnother thing we could have done is to compare using the `localeCompare` method:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction compare(a, b) {\r\n  return a.localeCompare(b, undefined, { numeric: true });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this is an order of magnitude slower than the current implementation, and sorting takes around `~30ms` instead.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOutstanding questions:\r\n\r\n1. ~~We could _only_ do this for the VS Code extension and Prettier plugin because then we wouldn't have to pay the performance penalty of ~~`~1ms`~~`~0.75ms`. This however means that the order in the extension or the Prettier plugin would be different compared to the order in the generated CSS. Should we only do it there or everywhere and pay the ~~`~1ms`~~`~0.75ms` penalty in favor of nicer consistency?~~ The performance is below ~1ms so good to include everywhere 👍 \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

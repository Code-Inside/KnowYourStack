Start the CLI, using the command line above (or tw.bat on Windows) \r\n2. Observe that the output file `twout.css` contains just two rules (after the boilerplate):\r\n```\r\n.ml-2 {\r\n  margin-left: 0.5rem !important\r\n}\r\n.ml-4 {\r\n  margin-left: 1rem !important\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Modify the index.html file so that the `ml-4` selector on the second div becomes `ml-6` and save the file\r\n4. Verify that the CLI regenerates the output file `twout.css`\r\n\r\nThe output file now contains\r\n```\r\n.ml-2 {\r\n  margin-left: 0.5rem !important\r\n}\r\n.ml-4 {\r\n  margin-left: 1rem !important\r\n}\r\n.ml-2 {\r\n  margin-left: 0.5rem !important\r\n}\r\n.ml-6 {\r\n  margin-left: 1.5rem !important\r\n}\r\n```\r\ni.e. the `.ml-2` rule has been duplicated.\r\n\r\nThis will happen each time a modification to the source file is made - there will be an additional `.ml-2` rule generated.\r\n\r\n**Some commentary:**\r\n\r\nI have spent some time trying to understand this, and I think there may be two separate problems, though I'm not a JS developer by trade, and I don't really understand TW's architecture, so please forgive me if I'm completely wrong here.\r\n\r\n**Possible Issue 1** -  Each time a file is modified, TW adds duplicates of all the rules related to that specific file to `context.stylesheetCache`.  This is nothing to do with whether the `important` configuration option is set or not.   However, this does not normally cause duplication in the output, because the code which later converts the list of rules into css code elides all the duplicates.   This may however be a part of the slow-down/leak problem in #7449.\r\n\r\n**Possible Issue 2**- The code which converts the rules list into CSS (is this Postcss?) is apparently able to elide duplicate rules, and that normally deals with the duplicates which build-up in the cache.   However, this elision features partly breaks (not completely - some rules get repeated 'n' times, whereas some only see one duplicate) when the `important` option is set.\r\n\r\nIf issue 1 is dealt with then issue 2 possibly wouldn't matter.  In #9203 I posted some very crude work-around code which stops the duplicates in the cache.\r\n\r\nEdit: This issue doesn't seem to repro in https://play.tailwindcss.com/\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/9205","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Using important: true leads to duplicate rules in output\" (#9205)"},{"Id":"1354665122","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-29T18:13:32","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"9208","RawContent":null,"Title":"Re-use existing entries in the rule cache","State":"closed","Body":"We didn't re-use existing entries in the rule cache when adding new candidates. This means the rule cache, when introducing new classes, grew by a much larger amount than it should have. In some cases even doubling in size. Over time this results in a pretty significant slow down. When this happens repeatedly it can cause rebuilds to go from ~20ms to over 650ms for a large number of classes.\r\n\r\nAlso, because of our not reusing entries from this cache, we would duplicate rules when changing from classes with the same high level sort order. E.g. `ml-2 ml-4` to `ml-2 ml-6` (on separate elements but appearing in this order in the source). \r\n\r\nI added two changeling entries for this because this change happens to fix two very different acting bugs so it seems reasonable to add more than one entry to the changeling.\r\n\r\nFixes #7449\r\nFixes #9205","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/9208","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Re-use existing entries in the rule cache\" (#9208)"},{"Id":"1354607996","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-29T17:06:10","Actor":"acalvino4","Number":"9206","RawContent":null,"Title":"Could not find a declaration file for module '@tailwindcss/<plugin>'.","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

However I'm going to describe it in the hope that it might be diagnosable by someone familiar with the code.  Please don't summarily execute my morning's worth of work on this bug report because of the lack of a URL - I will work with you guys to track this down.\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nEach time a new selector is found and added to the output on an update, at least one existing selector is also duplicated.\r\n\r\n* The starting point was a large output file, which already contain a `.ml-2` selector along with many many other selectors, including other `.ml-xx` values.  This is attached in zip file tailwind_orig.css.\r\n\r\n* I added a selector `ml-[96px]` to a div class property, TW did an update and inserted the following into the output file:\r\n```\r\n .ml-2 {\r\n  margin-left: 0.5rem !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.ml-\\[96px\\] {\r\n  margin-left: 96px !important;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe first selector is a duplicate of one which is already in the file, the ml-[96] is the correct new one.\r\nThere were also several other duplicates, scattered through the file.  The result is tailwind_diff1.css,, in zip.\r\n\r\n* Then I edited the source file to change the `ml-[96px]` into `ml-[94px]`,   Again, TW correctly detects the change, but adds the following to the output:\r\n```\r\n .ml-2 {\r\n  margin-left: 0.5rem !important;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.ml-\\[94px\\] {\r\n  margin-left: 94px !important;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThere are now three copies of the ml-2 selector: the original and two duplicates.\r\nThe other duplicates do not seem to have been repeated.\r\nThe result of this is tailwind_diff2.css\r\n\r\n* The process can be repeated indefinitely - each time the `ml-[??px]` selector is changed, TW adds the correct new code but also adds a duplicate of the `ml-2` selector.\r\n\r\nThe content spec from the config is:\r\n```\r\n    content: [\r\n        \"./Views/**/*.cshtml\",\r\n        \"./Views/**/*.razor\",\r\n        \"./Pages/**/*.cshtml\",\r\n        \"./Components/**/*.razor\"\r\n    ],\r\n```\r\nIt doesn't make any different whether I'm modifying the  file from Visual Studio or Notepad - i.e. it doesn't seem to be some safe-save race type problem.   We often notice other duplicates in the file, not just `ml` - a restart of the CLI cleans them up\r\n\r\n[TW_Dups.zip](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/files/9439649/TW_Dups.zip)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/9203","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"CLI duplicate selectors in output after updates when important: true\" (#9203)"},{"Id":"1353106477","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-28T17:00:23","Actor":"acalvino4","Number":"9200","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix safelist variant key required by typings","State":"closed","Body":"The typescript typings were requiring a `variant` key on the `safelist` object in the config.

[Preflight](https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@3.1.8/src/css/preflight.css) contains the following:\r\n```css\r\n/*\r\n1. Make replaced elements `display: block` by default. (https://github.com/mozdevs/cssremedy/issues/14)\r\n2. Add `vertical-align: middle` to align replaced elements more sensibly by default.

Browsers implement `hidden` with `display: none`, but the Tailwind preflight class has a higher specificity and so overrides it.\r\n\r\nI was wondering about the safest way to fix this without increasing specificity in a way that could break things. What's Tailwind's browser support policy say about using `:where()` for this kind of thing? I'm thinking that using the following structure would be ideal, but it wouldn't work on [older browsers that lack support](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_selectors_where).\r\n\r\n```css\r\niframe:not(:where([hidden])) {\r\n  display:block;\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/9165","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Preflight display declaration for iframe, img, etc. overrides the hidden attribute\" (#9165)"},{"Id":"1350012411","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-24T21:05:44","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"9174","RawContent":null,"Title":"Honor the `hidden` attribute on elements in preflight","State":"closed","Body":"You‚Äôll still be able to override this with utilities but this ensures that things like `<iframe hidden>` work as expected.\r\n\r\nFixes #9165","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/9174","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Honor the `hidden` attribute on elements in preflight\" (#9174)"},{"Id":"1349851703","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-24T18:47:59","Actor":"greatislander","Number":"9172","RawContent":null,"Title":"divide utility doesn't work properly when there's a <template> tag in the markup","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\nTailwind v2.2.19\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\npostcss v8.4.14, vite v2.9.13\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\nNode v16.15.1\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\n\r\nSafari 15.6.1, Firefox 104.0\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\n\r\nmacOS 12.5.1\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\n\r\nhttps://codepen.io/greatislander/pen/VwXNqxK\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nThe `divide` utility uses the general sibling combinator with `:not([hidden])` to ensure that borders are only inserted between visible elements.

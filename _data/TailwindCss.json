This PR fixes those 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n### Scenario 1\r\n\r\nWhen you have an arbitrary opacity modifier that doesn't use `%`, but is just a number typically between `0` and `1` then this was not converted to the bare value equivalent before.\r\n\r\nE.g.:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"bg-[#f00]/[0.16]\"></dv>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill now be converted to:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"bg-[#f00]/16\"></dv>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Scenario 2\r\n\r\nFixes a bug when a CSS function was used in a fallback value in the CSS variable shorthand syntax. In that case we didn't migrate the class to the new syntax.\r\n\r\nThis was because we assumed that a `(` was found, that we are dealing with a CSS function. \r\n\r\nE.g.: \r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"w-[--spacing(1)]\"></div>\r\n                        ^  This indicates a CSS function, we should not be \r\n                           converting this to `w-(--spacing(1))`\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if a function was used as a fallback value, for example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"bg-[--my-color,theme(colors.red.500)]\"></dv>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we also didn't migrate it, but since the function call is in the fallback, we can still migrate it.\r\n\r\nWill now properly be converted to:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"bg-(--my-color,var(--color-red-500))\"></dv>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\n1. Added a test for the first case\r\n2. Added a test for the second case\r\n3. Also added an integration-like test that runs all the migration steps to make sure that the `theme(…)` in the fallback also gets updated to `var(…)`. This one caught an issue because the `var(…)` wasn't handling prefixes correctly.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18184","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Improve upgrade migrations\" (#18184)"},{"Id":"3102823617","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-30T10:50:12","Actor":"drago1520","Number":"18183","RawContent":null,"Title":"Box shadow is broken","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

Alternatively, please could you provide and document a way for users to revert to the browser default behaviour for underlining links?\n\nAt the moment, the [only documentation I can find](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight#extending-preflight) seems to lead users to do the following:\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n@layer base {\n  a {\n    text-decoration-line: underline;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n...but this does not result in browser default behaviour, which is to underline anchors with an href and  to __not underline ones without an href__. This is a useful and intentional feature.\n\nUnfortunately in modern web dev, a common antipattern is to render an anchor with an onclick handler but no href.  __A link without an href is not focusable__ so the browser default styles help to discourage this.\n\nBy encouraging users to write CSS that does not distinguish between anchors with and without an href, I think Tailwind encourages this inaccessible antipattern.\n\nThis could be case of adding something like this (note use of :any-link) to the docs:\n\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n@layer base {\n  a:any-link {\n    text-decoration-line: underline;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThough for better browser compatibility, perhaps a way to remove the lines from preflight would be better.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18165","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Revert to browser behaviour for underlined links\" (#18165)"},{"Id":"3094789208","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-28T15:01:27","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"18164","RawContent":null,"Title":"Release v4.1.8","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18164","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Release v4.1.8\" (#18164)"},{"Id":"3089956558","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-27T17:02:11","Actor":"faner11","Number":"18148","RawContent":null,"Title":"@tailwindcss/vite 4.1.7 slows down Vite builds significantly in Jenkins","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\nV4.1.7\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nVite 6.3.5\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nV22.16.0\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\n-\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nLinux Jenkins\n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\nhttps://github.com/faner11/react-antd/tree/jenkins-demo\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nUsing the latest version of @tailwindcss/vite (V4.1.7) will slow down the build speed in Jenkins.

Then I noticed an odd migration...\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where the upgrade tool accidentally migrated classes such as `mt-[0px]` to `-mt-[0px]`. The reason for this is because we are trying to find a replacement, and the computed signature for both of them are exactly the same.\r\n\r\n- `mt-[0px]` translates to:\r\n\r\n   ```css\r\n   .x {\r\n     margin-top: 0px;\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n- `-mt-[0px]` translates to:\r\n\r\n   ```css\r\n   .x {\r\n     margin-top: calc(0px * -1);\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   Which in turn translates to\r\n\r\n   ```css\r\n   .x {\r\n     margin-top: 0px;\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   Notice that this is `0px`, not `-0px`.\r\n\r\nInternally we use the roots of functional utilities to find replacements. For intellisense purposes we typically show negative versions before positive versions. This then means that we will try `-mt-*` before `mt-*`. Because of the signature above, the `mt-[0px]` was translated into `-mt-[0px]`.\r\n\r\nWe could solve this in a few ways. The first thing we can try is to make sure that the signature is not the same and that `-mt-[0px]` actually translates into `-0px` not `0px`.\r\n\r\nThis would solve our problem of the accidental migration. However, if we _just_ sort the functional utilities roots such that the positive versions exist before negative version and rely on the fact that `-mt-[0px]` has the same signature. Then it also means that by doing that we can migrate `-mt-[0px]` into `mt-[0px]` which is even better because it's the same result and shorter.\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\n1. Added a test to verify that `mt-[0px]` does not get migrated to `-mt-[0px]`.\r\n2.

It might not be easy to spot but the easy is the additional `)` after the `90`.\r\n\r\nThe reason this crashes is because we parse the value `var(--color-maroon)/90)` and when we see `)` we assume it's the end of a \"function\" which also assumes it was preceded by a `(`. This is not the case and we crash.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that by not assuming the parsed object is available and uses `?` to be safe and only access `nodes` if it's available.\r\n\r\nI'm actually not 100% sure what the best solution is in this scenario because these candidates could (and will) be returned from Oxide so even if we throw a more descriptive error, it will still crash the build and you might not even have control over the candidate.\r\n\r\nThis candidate will now eventually generate the following CSS:\r\n```css\r\n.\\[--btn-border\\:var\\(--color-maroon\\)\\/90\\)\\] {\r\n  --btn-border: var(--color-maroon) / ;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich still looks odd, but even Lightning CSS doesn't throw an error in this case (because it's a CSS variable definition), so I think it's the best we can do. If you open your devtools you will see the weird values, so it's still debug-able.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"359\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2eb48662-64de-4417-a2da-1577bf9075b5\" />\r\n\r\nFixes: #17064\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\nManually tested the candidate that crashed it, and after the change generated the above CSS.

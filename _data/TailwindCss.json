We're a small team and without all of this information it's not possible for us to help and your bug report will be closed. -->\n\n**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\nv4.0.6 (the version used on the Tailwind CSS documentation site)\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nNext.js 15.3.4 (as indicated in the terminal output when running the site locally)\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nv20.0.0\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nChrome with Axe DevTools extension for accessibility testing\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nWindows\n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\nhttps://tailwindcss.com/ (The issue appears on the official documentation site itself)\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nThe Tailwind CSS documentation site has multiple color contrast issues that fail WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards as detected by the Axe DevTools browser extension. Specifically:\n\n1. The utility class indicators throughout the homepage (elements with `aria-hidden=\"true\"` showing Tailwind class names) have insufficient color contrast:\n   - In light mode: Using `text-black/20` (black at 20% opacity) which has a contrast ratio of approximately 2:1\n   - In dark mode: Using `dark:text-white/25` (white at 25% opacity) which has a contrast ratio of approximately 3:1\n\nBoth fail the WCAG AA standard requiring a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text (or 3:1 for large text).\n\nWhile these elements are correctly marked with `aria-hidden=\"true\"` to hide them from screen readers, they are still visible to users with low vision or color vision deficiencies who aren't using screen readers. Therefore, they should still meet contrast requirements.\n\nIn total, Axe reports 26 failing contrast elements in dark mode and 30 in light mode, mostly related to these utility class indicators.\n\n**Example from `hero.tsx`:**\n```tsx\n<div\n  aria-hidden=\"true\"\n  className=\"flex h-16 items-end px-2 font-mono text-xs/6 whitespace-pre text-black/20 max-sm:px-4 sm:h-24 dark:text-white/25\"\n>\n  <span className=\"hidden max-sm:inline\">text-4xl </span>\n  <span className=\"hidden sm:max-md:inline\">text-5xl </span>\n  <span className=\"hidden lg:max-xl:inline\">text-6xl </span>\n  <span className=\"hidden xl:inline\">text-8xl </span>\n  <span className=\"inline dark:hidden\">text-gray-950 </span>\n  <span className=\"hidden dark:inline\">text-white </span>tracking-tighter{\" \"}\n  <span className=\"max-sm:hidden\">text-balance</span>\n</div>\n\nSuggested fix: Increase the opacity of these indicator elements to meet WCAG AA standards:\n\nFor light mode: Change text-black/20 to text-black/55 (contrast ratio ~4.5:1)\nFor dark mode: Change dark:text-white/25 to dark:text-white/50 (contrast ratio ~5.3:1)\nThis would ensure the site is accessible to users with visual impairments while still maintaining the subtle, secondary visual nature of these indicators.\n\nNote: The fact that these elements have aria-hidden=\"true\" only addresses screen reader accessibility but doesn't exempt them from visual accessibility requirements like color contrast.\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18858","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"tailwindcss.com homepage fails WCAG for color contrasts\" (#18858)"},{"Id":"3374701393","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-02T09:29:50","Actor":"Faraz1995","Number":"18854","RawContent":null,"Title":"Tailwind CSS v4 styles not applied in Android 10/11","State":"closed","Body":"hi\ni am using tailwind 4 , vite, tanstack router, i am making a webview loading a url, url looks fine on chrome, but on android device with version 10/11 , the whole style did not load, but when i roll back to tailwind 3, everything is fine!\n\nExpected behavior:\nTailwind v4 should be able to generate compatible CSS when targeting older browsers (e.g., Android 10/11 WebView) using Browserslist.\n\nstyles.css\n`\n@supports not (color: rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5)) {\n  body {\n    background: black !important;\n  }\n}\n\n@import 'tailwindcss';\n\n`\n\npackage.json\n\n`\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^4.0.6\",\n    \"@tailwindcss/vite\": \"^4.0.6\",\n    \"@tailwindcss/postcss\": \"^4.1.12\",\n    \"vite\": \"^6.1.0\"\n  },\n  \"browserslist\": [\n    \"defaults\",\n    \"Android >= 5\",\n    \"iOS >= 12\"\n  ]\n}\n`\n\nvite.config.js\n\n`import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'\nimport viteReact from '@vitejs/plugin-react'\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite'\nimport autoprefixer from 'autoprefixer'\nimport postcssPresetEnv from 'postcss-preset-env'\nimport tanstackRouter from '@tanstack/router-plugin/vite'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  css: {\n    postcss: {\n      plugins: [\n        autoprefixer(),\n        postcssPresetEnv({\n          stage: 2,\n          browsers: ['Android >= 8'],\n          features: {\n            'custom-properties': true,\n          },\n        }),\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    tanstackRouter({ target: 'react', autoCodeSplitting: true }),\n    viteReact(),\n    tailwindcss(),\n  ],\n})\n`\n\nand .broswerslistrc\n\n`defaults\nAndroid >= 5\niOS >= 12\n`\n\npostcss.config.mjs\n`export default {\n  plugins: {\n    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},\n  },\n}\n`\n\nany idea or solution except rolling back to v3?\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18854","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Tailwind CSS v4 styles not applied in Android 10/11\" (#18854)"},{"Id":"3374738143","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-02T09:26:06","Actor":"mischnic","Number":"18855","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add '.vercel' to ignored content directories","State":"closed","Body":"Just like `.next` is ignored, ignore `.vercel` as well.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18855","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add '.vercel' to ignored content directories\" (#18855)"},{"Id":"3374641639","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-02T08:13:15","Actor":"hustrust","Number":"18853","RawContent":null,"Title":"chore: remove redundant words","State":"closed","Body":"<!--\r\n\r\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

To achieve the necessary mappings, I have to generate the Tailwind config using a custom code-generation script, which is both ugly and hard to maintain. I'm forced to essentially re-implement or reverse-engineer how Tailwind generates spacing and utility classes, which feels fragile and not in the intended spirit of the framework.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n1. Attempt to map a complex design system (with domain-focused color and spacing tokens) to Tailwind utility domains using only the new CSS DSL config syntax.\n2. Notice that there is no first-class way to control or limit how each design token maps to only certain Tailwind utility domains or property groups (e.g., ensuring a color token appears only as a background, not a border, or mapping spacing tokens only to padding/gap).\n3. As a workaround, generate the config with your own code, essentially duplicating the logic that Tailwind itself uses internally.\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\nI'd expect to be able to use Tailwind's config and generator in a \"semantic\" or \"domain-aware\" manner, mapping complex design system tokens to only the relevant utility groups, while still taking full advantage of Tailwind's underlying generator and conventions—without having to write custom code-generation tooling. This would make working with complex/enterprise-level design systems much more maintainable and would reinforce Tailwind's place as a flexible foundation for modern web UI work.\n\n<img width=\"490\" height=\"490\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7865e959-9c1a-4ac6-a9d6-4f81125c0f01\" />\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18841","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Mapping complex design systems to tailwind utilities broken in v4 CSS config DSL\" (#18841)"},{"Id":"3368984600","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-30T13:24:58","Actor":"alaindeurveilher","Number":"18836","RawContent":null,"Title":"cannot install @tailwindcss/postcss on Stackblitz with v4.1.12","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

I thought about special casing these but we already have an optimization pass where we perform a full walk of the AST, flattening some rules (with the `&` selector), analyzing declarations, etc… We can utilize that existing spot in core to analyze and remove duplicate declarations within rules across the AST.\r\n\r\nThe implementation does this by keeping track of declarations within a style rule and keeps the last one for any *exact duplicate* which is a tuple of `(property, value, important)`. This does require some additional loops but preseving the *last* declaration is important for correctness with regards to CSS nesting.\r\n\r\nFor example take this nested CSS:\r\n```css\r\n.foo {\r\n  color: red;\r\n  & .bar {\r\n    color: green;\r\n  }\r\n  color: red;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt expands to this:\r\n```css\r\n.foo {\r\n  color: red;\r\n}\r\n.foo.bar {\r\n  color: green;\r\n}\r\n.foo {\r\n  color: red;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you remove the *last* rule then a `<div class=\"foo bar\">…</div>` will have green text when its supposed to be red. Since that would affect behavior we have to always preserve the last declaration for a given property.\r\n\r\nWe could go further and eliminate multiple declarations for the same property *but* this presents a problem: every property and value must be understood and combined with browser targets to understand whether or not that property may act as a \"fallback\" or whether definitely overwrites its previous value in all cases. This is a much more complicated task that is much more suited to something light Lighting CSS.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18809","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Drop exact duplicate declarations from output CSS within a style rule\" (#18809)"},{"Id":"3361027109","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-29T15:01:21","Actor":"benface","Number":"18812","RawContent":null,"Title":"IntelliSense suggests weird `__CSS_VALUES__` value","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\nv4.1.12, and actually even the most recent insiders version (`0.0.0-insiders.8165e04`)\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nNone, just `tailwindcss` and `@tailwindcss/cli`\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nv24.5.0\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nN/A\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nmacOS\n\n**Reproduction ~~URL~~ steps / Describe your issue**\n\nIn a legacy `@plugin`:\n```js\nmatchUtilities(\n  {\n    foo: (value) => ({\n      \"--foo\": value,\n    }),\n  },\n  {\n    values: theme(\"colors\"),\n  }\n);\n```\n\nIn the HTML:\n```html\n<div class=\"foo-\n               ^\n               First IntelliSense suggestion:\n               - foo-__CSS_VALUES__\n```","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18812","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"IntelliSense suggests weird `__CSS_VALUES__` value\" (#18812)"},{"Id":"3363696439","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-29T15:01:20","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"18820","RawContent":null,"Title":"Hide internal fields from completions in `matchUtilities`","State":"closed","Body":"The `__CSS_VALUES__` field is an internal field we use to transport data about theme options from CSS throug hte JS plugin API.

This makes it impossible to run any npx tailwindcss commands, as the executable cannot be found.\n\nThis issue was confirmed through an extensive troubleshooting process with the following key findings:\n\nThe bug has been replicated on two different Windows laptops, confirming it is not a unique machine configuration issue.\n\nInstalling an older version, specifically tailwindcss@3.3.0, works correctly and the .bin executable is created as expected.\n\nInstalling other packages with executables (e.g., npm install -D vite) also works correctly, which proves that the npm client and the underlying system are functioning properly.\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests a bug exists in recent versions of the tailwindcss package that prevents the bin script from being properly linked during installation on Windows.\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18806","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Bug in latest release of Tailwind CSS\" (#18806)"},{"Id":"3357127532","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-27T14:32:25","Actor":"KipzonderKop101","Number":"18802","RawContent":null,"Title":"@tailwindcss/vite plugin: issue with Vite and plugin typing","State":"closed","Body":"Hi all,\n\n**TailwindCSS version**: 4.1.12\n**TailwindCSS plugin version**: 4.1.12\n\n**SolidStart version**: 1.1.0\n**Solid version**: 1.9.5\n**Vinxi**: 0.5.7\n\n**Node version**: 22.13.1\n**NPM version**: 11.5.2\n\nBrowser version seems irrelevant, as error happens before anything is shown at all.\n\n**OS**: Windows 11\n\n**Reproduction URL**: https://github.com/KipzonderKop101/tailwindcss-typing-issue-reproduction\n\n\nLet's start off by thanking the team for the plugin in the first place. It's been a breath of fresh air. \n\nHowever, I had an issue with my new SolidStart application. While configuring my `app.config.ts` I got a typing error. I've had this issue before and got around it by using Tailwind's CLI, which meant I lost HRM updates. Because of this, I looked into it, and configured the plugins such as [SolidStart describes](https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-start/reference/config/define-config), which left me with the following configuration. \n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig } from \"@solidjs/start/config\";\nimport tailwindcss from \"@tailwindcss/vite\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  vite: {\n    plugins: [tailwindcss()],\n  },\n});\n```\n\nThis configuration should be perfect on paper, but it gave me the following error. Which of course is the typing error I described.\n\n```\nType 'Plugin$1<any>[]' is not assignable to type 'PluginOption'.\n  Type 'Plugin$1<any>[]' is not assignable to type 'PluginOption[]'.\n    Type 'Plugin$1<any>' is not assignable to type 'PluginOption'.\n      Type 'Plugin$1<any>' is not assignable to type 'Plugin<any>'.\n        Types of property 'hotUpdate' are incompatible.\n          Type 'ObjectHook<(this: MinimalPluginContext & { environment: DevEnvironment; }, options: HotUpdateOptions) => void | EnvironmentModuleNode[] | Promise<...>> | undefined' is not assignable to type 'ObjectHook<(this: HotUpdatePluginContext, options: HotUpdateOptions) => void | EnvironmentModuleNode[] | Promise<void | EnvironmentModuleNode[]>> | undefined'.\n            Type '(this: MinimalPluginContext & { environment: DevEnvironment; }, options: HotUpdateOptions) => void | EnvironmentModuleNode[] | Promise<...>' is not assignable to type 'ObjectHook<(this: HotUpdatePluginContext, options: HotUpdateOptions) => void | EnvironmentModuleNode[] | Promise<void | EnvironmentModuleNode[]>> | undefined'.\n              Type '(this: MinimalPluginContext & { environment: DevEnvironment; }, options: HotUpdateOptions) => void | EnvironmentModuleNode[] | Promise<...>' is not assignable to type '(this: HotUpdatePluginContext, options: HotUpdateOptions) => void | EnvironmentModuleNode[] | Promise<void | EnvironmentModuleNode[]>'.\n                The 'this' types of each signature are incompatible.\n                  Type 'HotUpdatePluginContext' is not assignable to type 'MinimalPluginContext & { environment: DevEnvironment; }'.\n                    Type 'HotUpdatePluginContext' is missing the following properties from type 'MinimalPluginContext': debug, error, info, meta, warnts(2322)\n```\n\nSo as to reproduce, create a new project with SolidStart and install the latest version of the TailwindCSS Vite plugin. After the configuration mentioned earlier you should get the error.\n\nAs to solve the error for now, you can cast the plugin as an any type, which of course is suboptimal.\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig } from \"@solidjs/start/config\";\nimport tailwindcss from \"@tailwindcss/vite\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  vite: {\n    // Cast as any untill Tailwindcss is updated to use Vite 6\n    plugins: [tailwindcss() as any],\n  },\n});\n\n```\n\nHope this helps!\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18802","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"@tailwindcss/vite plugin: issue with Vite and plugin typing\" (#18802)"},{"Id":"3358636416","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-27T11:02:36","Actor":"nathanael-ruf","Number":"18804","RawContent":null,"Title":"Poor performance of space-* classes (:where(& > :not(:last-child)))","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\n4.1.12\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nVite 6.3.5\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\n22.15.0\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nChrome\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nmacOS\n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\nI tried to reproduce in Tailwind Play, but it seems like that it not actually using tailwind v4 if v4 is selected.

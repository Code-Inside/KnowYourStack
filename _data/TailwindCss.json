The phoenix tailwind plugin uses the tailwind-cli binary from this repo directly.\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\n\r\nLinux\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nI believe this issue was originally fixed by Jose Valim's [PR](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/4997/files) which added a listener on stdin. If stdin was closed, it was deemed that the parent process must have died, so tailwind process should clean itself up.\r\n\r\nHowever following a [reported issue in turborepo](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/8517), @thecrypticace added [a fix](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/8523/files) that only watches stdin closing when __on__ TTY, citing esbuild's solution as inspiration. However, the [esbuild solution](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/1449/commits/2c4077fecee076253443528a30546b6134c6ca05#diff-05b75125242d4be652d3c0da7fee672c4b8cdad213b064ca4583aec231b774bcR272) was to listen to stdin closing when __NOT__ on TTY because that's how frameworks like Phoenix spawns background processes like esbuild or tailwind, which sounds sensible to me. In any case, I believe this fix has now caused a [regression](https://github.com/phoenixframework/tailwind/issues/46) in Phoenix.\r\n\r\nWhile I think esbuild's solution of stdin listening when *not* on TTY is the correct approach and will fix this issue for Phoenix (though I haven't tested it), unfortunately I don't know what that will mean for turborepo.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/9264","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Dangling tailwind-cli process when using Phoenix Framework\" (#9264)"},{"Id":"1373469769","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-14T20:06:34","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"9331","RawContent":null,"Title":"Revert \"Only listen for stdin close on TTYs (#8523)\"","State":"closed","Body":"This reverts commit 14f6574318b66f7df4d8767c2c70ecb73c4ee26d.\r\n\r\nThis was originally done to fix issues with Turborepo but it had some unforeseen side effects that would leave dangling processes. For things that use Erlang (for example Phoenix) this is a problem because Erlang does not have the necessary APIs to send signals to processes — instead relying only on stdin closing behavior or wrapper scripts to work around this.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus it seems that Turborepo has updated their official tailwind example to use `concurrently` which sidesteps this problem entirely because it acts as the wrapper in this case and handles stdin for child processes appropriately.\r\n\r\nFixes #9264","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/9331","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Revert \"Only listen for stdin close on TTYs (#8523)\"\" (#9331)"},{"Id":"1370580146","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-14T19:29:58","Actor":"yaronuliel","Number":"9316","RawContent":null,"Title":"Exception thrown when a plugin defined with `plugin.withOptions` is being used without options","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\nv3.1.8\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\nvite 3.1.0, postcss 8.4.16\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\nv18.7.0\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\nNot Relevant\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\nmacOS 12.5 \r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\nhttps://play.tailwindcss.com/RJUiGy8hnJ\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\nAccording to the [documentation](https://play.tailwindcss.com/RJUiGy8hnJ), plugins defined with `plugin.withOptions` should work as callable function with `options` object, or by just passing them to the `plugins` array without invoking the function\r\n\r\nFor example, these 2 snippets should do the same thing:\r\n```js\r\nconst customPlugin1 = plugin.withOptions(...)\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n   ...,\r\n   plugins: [customPlugin1]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst customPlugin2 = plugin.withOptions(...)\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n   ...,\r\n   plugins: [customPlugin2({})]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, the first snippet, passes `undefined` instead of `{}` for the `options` argument - causing direct access to properties on the `options` argument (as depicted in the docs) to throw the following exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCannot read properties of undefined (reading '[WHATEVER]')\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd either expect the docs to be corrected [here](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/blob/master/src/pages/docs/plugins.mdx?plain=1#L539) and [here](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/blob/master/src/pages/docs/plugins.mdx?plain=1#L573), or preferably - the library to send `{}` as the `options` argument if the plugin is registered without invoking it ","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/9316","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Exception thrown when a plugin defined with `plugin.withOptions` is being used without options\" (#9316)"},{"Id":"1371631780","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-14T17:27:03","Actor":"Odas0R","Number":"9318","RawContent":null,"Title":"Tailwind compiler crashes when you try to `[--box-shadow:theme('boxShadow.doesNotExist')]`","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\nFor example: v3.1.8\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\nFor example: vite 3.0.9, postcss 8.4.14 postcss-cli 8.3.1\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\nFor example: v16.0.0\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\n\r\nFor example: Chrome\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\n\r\nFor example: PopOS, Ubuntu\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-zy2efk?file=src/App.jsx\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nI was thinkering with tailwind to find ways of modifying css variables with classes.

This is useful when you define multiple background colors for example:\n```html\n<div class=\"bg-[rgb(0,0,0),rgb(255,255,255)]\"></div>\n```\n\nIn this case splitting by the regex would result in the proper result:\n```js\nlet result = [\n  'rgb(0,0,0)',\n  'rgb(255,255,255)'\n]\n```\n\nVisually, you can think of it like:\n```\n    ┌─[./example.html]\n    │\n∙ 1 │   <div class=\"bg-[rgb(0,0,0),rgb(255,255,255)]\"></div>\n    ·                       ──┬── ┬    ─────┬─────\n    ·                         │   │         ╰─────── Guarded by parens\n    ·                         │   ╰───────────────── We will split here\n    ·                         ╰───────────────────── Guarded by parens\n    │\n    └─\n```\n\nWe properly split by `,` not inside a `()`. However, this RegEx fails the moment you have deeply nested `,` values or an `(` is seen at the right of the current position. If you have the following example:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"bg-[rgba(0,0,0,var(--alpha))]\"></div>\n```\n\nVisually, this is what's happening:\n```\n    ┌─[./example.html]\n    │\n∙ 1 │   <div class=\"bg-[rgba(0,0,0,var(--alpha))]\"></div>\n    ·                         ┬ ┬ ┬\n    ·                         ╰─┴─┴── We accidentally split here\n    │\n    └─\n```\n\nThis is because on the right of the `,`, the first paren is an opening paren `(` instead of a closing one `)`.\n\nI'm not 100% sure how we can improve the RegEx to handle that case as well, instead I wrote a small `splitBy` function that allows you to split the string by a character (just like you could do before) but ignores the ones inside the given exceptions. This keeps track of a stack to know whether we are within parens or not.\n\nVisually, the fix looks like this:\n```\n    ┌─[./example.html]\n    │\n∙ 1 │   <div class=\"bg-[rgba(0,0,0,var(--alpha)),rgb(255,255,255,var(--alpha))]\"></div>\n    ·                         ┬ ┬ ┬             ┬       ┬   ┬   ┬\n    ·                         │ │ │             │       ╰───┴───┴── Guarded by parens\n    ·                         │ │ │             ╰────────────────── We will split here\n    ·                         ╰─┴─┴──────────────────────────────── Guarded by parens\n    │\n    └─\n```\n\n<!--\n\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

The rationale is that stdin is automatically closed by the OS when the parent process exits, so stopping watch mode when stdin is closed ensures that esbuild's watch mode doesn't keep running forever after the parent process has been closed. For example, it would be bad if you wrote a shell script that did <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild --watch &amp;</code> to run esbuild's watch mode in the background, and every time you run the script it creates a new <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild</code> process that runs forever.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">However, there are cases when it makes sense for esbuild's watch mode to never exit. One such case is within a short-lived VM where the lifetime of all processes inside the VM is expected to be the lifetime of the VM. Previously you could easily do this by piping the output of a long-lived command into esbuild's stdin such as <code class=\"notranslate\">sleep 999999999 | esbuild --watch &amp;</code>. However, this possibility often doesn't occur to people, and it also doesn't work on Windows. People also sometimes attempt to keep esbuild open by piping an infinite stream of data to esbuild such as with <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild --watch &lt;/dev/zero &amp;</code> which causes esbuild to spin at 100% CPU. So with this release, esbuild now has a <code class=\"notranslate\">--watch=forever</code> flag that will not stop watch mode when stdin is closed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Work around <code class=\"notranslate\">PATH</code> without <code class=\"notranslate\">node</code> in install script (<a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2519\">#2519</a>)</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Some people install esbuild's npm package in an environment without the <code class=\"notranslate\">node</code> command in their <code class=\"notranslate\">PATH</code>. This fails on Windows because esbuild's install script runs the <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild</code> command before exiting as a sanity check, and on Windows the <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild</code> command has to be a JavaScript file because of some internal details about how npm handles the <code class=\"notranslate\">bin</code> folder (specifically the <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild</code> command lacks the <code class=\"notranslate\">.exe</code> extension, which is required on Windows). This release attempts to work around this problem by using <code class=\"notranslate\">process.execPath</code> instead of <code class=\"notranslate\">\"node\"</code> as the command for running node. In theory this means the installer can now still function on Windows if something is wrong with <code class=\"notranslate\">PATH</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul></blockquote>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/releases/tag/v0.15.6\">0.15.6</a></h4>\n\n<blockquote><ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Lower <code class=\"notranslate\">for await</code> loops (<a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1930\">#1930</a>)</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This release lowers <code class=\"notranslate\">for await</code> loops to the equivalent <code class=\"notranslate\">for</code> loop containing <code class=\"notranslate\">await</code> when esbuild is configured such that <code class=\"notranslate\">for await</code> loops are unsupported.

This new transformation is mostly modeled after what the TypeScript compiler does.

This is problematic because values are supposed to be kept during the conversion but types are supposed to be removed during the conversion. Currently esbuild keeps <code class=\"notranslate\">bar</code> in the output, which is done because <code class=\"notranslate\">someNamespace.foo</code> is a property access and property accesses run code that could potentially have a side effect (although there is no side effect in this case).</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">With this release, esbuild will now consider <code class=\"notranslate\">someNamespace.foo</code> to have no side effects. This means <code class=\"notranslate\">bar</code> will now be removed when bundling and when tree shaking is enabled. Note that it will still not be removed when tree shaking is disabled. This is because in this mode, esbuild supports adding additional code to the end of the generated output that's in the same scope as the module. That code could potentially make use of <code class=\"notranslate\">bar</code>, so it would be incorrect to remove it.

This is because the process of setting up package path resolution rules requires parsing <code class=\"notranslate\">tsconfig.json</code> files (due to the <code class=\"notranslate\">baseUrl</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">paths</code> features) and resolving <code class=\"notranslate\">extends</code> to a package path requires package path resolution rules to already be set up, which is a circular dependency. This cycle is broken by using special rules for <code class=\"notranslate\">extends</code> in <code class=\"notranslate\">tsconfig.json</code> that bypasses esbuild's normal package path resolution process. This is why using <code class=\"notranslate\">extends</code> with a Yarn PnP package didn't automatically work.

The changes are as follows:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Check for platform-specific absolute paths instead of always for the <code class=\"notranslate\">/</code> prefix</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The specification previously said that Yarn Plug'n'Play path resolution rules should not apply for paths that start with <code class=\"notranslate\">/</code>. The intent was to avoid accidentally processing absolute paths. However, absolute paths on Windows such as <code class=\"notranslate\">C:\\project</code> start with drive letters instead of with <code class=\"notranslate\">/</code>. So the specification was changed to instead explicitly avoid processing absolute paths.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Make <code class=\"notranslate\">$$virtual</code> an alias for <code class=\"notranslate\">__virtual__</code></p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Supporting Yarn-style path resolution requires implementing a custom Yarn-specific path traversal scheme where certain path segments are considered no-ops. Specifically any path containing segments of the form <code class=\"notranslate\">__virtual__/&lt;whatever&gt;/&lt;n&gt;</code> where <code class=\"notranslate\">&lt;n&gt;</code> is an integer must be treated as if they were <code class=\"notranslate\">n</code> times the <code class=\"notranslate\">..</code> operator instead (the <code class=\"notranslate\">&lt;whatever&gt;</code> path segment is ignored). So <code class=\"notranslate\">/path/to/project/__virtual__/xyz/2/foo.js</code> maps to the underlying file <code class=\"notranslate\">/path/to/project/../../foo.js</code>. This scheme makes it possible for Yarn to get node (and esbuild) to load the same file multiple times (which is sometimes required for correctness) without actually duplicating the file on the file system.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">However, old versions of Yarn used to use <code class=\"notranslate\">$$virtual</code> instead of <code class=\"notranslate\">__virtual__</code>. This was changed because <code class=\"notranslate\">$$virtual</code> was error-prone due to the use of the <code class=\"notranslate\">$</code> character, which can cause bugs when it's not correctly escaped within regular expressions. Now that esbuild makes <code class=\"notranslate\">$$virtual</code> an alias for <code class=\"notranslate\">__virtual__</code>, esbuild should now work with manifests from these old Yarn versions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Ignore PnP manifests in virtual directories</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The specification describes the algorithm for how to find the Plug'n'Play manifest when starting from a certain point in the file system: search through all parent directories in reverse order until the manifest is found. However, this interacts poorly with virtual paths since it can end up finding a virtual copy of the manifest instead of the original. To avoid this, esbuild now ignores manifests in virtual directories so that the search for the manifest will continue and find the original manifest in another parent directory later on.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">These fixes mean that esbuild's implementation of Plug'n'Play now matches Yarn's implementation more closely, and esbuild can now correctly build more projects that use Plug'n'Play.</p>\n</li>\n</ul></blockquote>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/releases/tag/v0.15.0\">0.15.0</a></h4>\n\n<blockquote><p dir=\"auto\"><strong>This release contains backwards-incompatible changes.</strong> Since esbuild is before version 1.0.0, these changes have been released as a new minor version to reflect this (as <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/\">recommended by npm</a>).

Node and esbuild both come with built-in rules for resolving import paths to packages within <code class=\"notranslate\">node_modules</code>, so packages installed via npm work automatically without any configuration. However, many people use an alternative package manager called <a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/\">Yarn</a>. While Yarn can install packages using <code class=\"notranslate\">node_modules</code>, it also offers a different package installation strategy called <a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/features/pnp/\">Plug'n'Play</a>, which is often shortened to \"PnP\" (not to be confused with <a href=\"https://pnpm.io/\">pnpm</a>, which is an entirely different unrelated package manager).</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Plug'n'Play installs packages as <code class=\"notranslate\">.zip</code> files on your file system. The packages are never actually unzipped. Since Node doesn't know anything about Yarn's package installation strategy, this means you can no longer run your code with Node as it won't be able to find your packages. Instead, you need to run your code with Yarn, which applies patches to Node's file system APIs before running your code. These patches attempt to make zip files seem like normal directories. When running under Yarn, using Node's file system API to read <code class=\"notranslate\">./some.zip/lib/file.js</code> actually automatically extracts <code class=\"notranslate\">lib/file.js</code> from <code class=\"notranslate\">./some.zip</code> at run-time as if it was a normal file. Other file system APIs behave similarly. However, these patches don't work with esbuild because esbuild is not written in JavaScript; it's a native binary executable that interacts with the file system directly through the operating system.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Previously the workaround for using esbuild with Plug'n'Play was to use the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yarnpkg/esbuild-plugin-pnp\"><code class=\"notranslate\">@yarnpkg/esbuild-plugin-pnp</code></a> plugin with esbuild's JavaScript API. However, this wasn't great because the plugin needed to potentially intercept every single import path and file load to check whether it was a Plug'n'Play package, which has an unusually high performance cost. It also meant that certain subtleties of path resolution rules within a <code class=\"notranslate\">.zip</code> file could differ slightly from the way esbuild normally works since path resolution inside <code class=\"notranslate\">.zip</code> files was implemented by Yarn, not by esbuild (which is due to a limitation of esbuild's plugin API).</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">With this release, esbuild now contains an independent implementation of Yarn's Plug'n'Play algorithm (which is used when esbuild finds a <code class=\"notranslate\">.pnp.js</code>, <code class=\"notranslate\">.pnp.cjs</code>, or <code class=\"notranslate\">.pnp.data.json</code> file in the directory tree). Creating additional implementations of this algorithm recently became possible because Yarn's package manifest format was recently documented: <a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnp-spec/\">https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/pnp-spec/</a>. This should mean that you can now use esbuild to bundle Plug'n'Play projects without any additional configuration (so you shouldn't need <code class=\"notranslate\">@yarnpkg/esbuild-plugin-pnp</code> anymore). Bundling these projects should now happen much faster as Yarn no longer even needs to be run at all. Bundling the Yarn codebase itself with esbuild before and after this change seems to demonstrate over a 10x speedup (3.4s to 0.24s). And path resolution rules within Yarn packages should now be consistent with how esbuild handles regular Node packages. For example, fields such as <code class=\"notranslate\">module</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">browser</code> in <code class=\"notranslate\">package.json</code> files within <code class=\"notranslate\">.zip</code> files should now be respected.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Keep in mind that this is brand new code and there may be some initial issues to work through before esbuild's implementation is solid. Yarn's Plug'n'Play specification is also brand new and may need some follow-up edits to guide new implementations to match Yarn's exact behavior. If you try this out, make sure to test it before committing to using it, and let me know if anything isn't working as expected. Should you need to debug esbuild's path resolution, you may find <code class=\"notranslate\">--log-level=verbose</code> helpful.</p>\n</li>\n</ul></blockquote>\n<p><em>Does any of this look wrong? <a href=\"https://depfu.com/packages/npm/esbuild/feedback\">Please let us know.</a></em></p>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/04ef75fd7ff534a636962f14e11d224c84aa2020...c0b8a538c2bf5106977895535010ec402cae75f8\">See the full diff on Github</a>.

This resulted in a problem where we'd produce something like the following for `peer-checked:bar`:\r\n```css\r\n.foo.peer:checked ~ .peer-checked\\:bar {\r\n    /* ... */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is obviously a mistake as it completely mangles the original meaning of the selector. This PR fixes this.\r\n\r\nFixes #9056\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis, however, opens an interesting question:\r\n\r\nWhen given a utility like `.foo .bar` the replacement is fairly simple for either `hover:foo` or `hover:bar`. But what about `group-hover:foo`, `peer-checked:foo`, `group-hover:bar`, and `peer-checked:bar`?\r\n\r\nWith this there are obvious interpretations for `foo` but not necessarily so for `bar`:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/* Given the utility */\r\n.foo .bar { color: red; }\r\n\r\n/* obvious interpretations for `foo` */\r\n.group:hover .group-hover\\:foo .bar { color: green; }\r\n.peer:checked ~ .peer-checked\\:foo .bar { color: green; }\r\n\r\n/* ambiguous interpretations for `bar` */\r\n.group:hover .foo .group-hover\\:bar { color: green; }\r\n.foo .group:hover .group-hover\\:bar { color: green; }\r\n\r\n.peer:checked ~ .foo .peer-checked\\:bar { color: green; }\r\n.foo .peer:checked ~ .peer-checked\\:bar { color: green; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe've decided that, while it may not suit all use cases, the best way to approach this is to slot in the entire variant selector in the spot where the class candidate is. As such the variants for foo and bar above will produce the following:\r\n```css\r\n.group:hover .group-hover\\:foo .bar { color: green; }\r\n.peer:checked ~ .peer-checked\\:foo .bar { color: green; }\r\n.foo .group:hover .group-hover\\:bar { color: green; }\r\n.foo .peer:checked ~ .peer-checked\\:bar { color: green; }\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/9262","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Handle variants on complex selectors\" (#9262)"},{"Id":"1363553633","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-06T16:47:24","Actor":"n1k1c4","Number":"9275","RawContent":null,"Title":"Arbitrary properties mask-image and clip-path conflicting","State":"closed","Body":"I am using `tailwindcss: 3.1.8` and `eslint-plugin-tailwindcss: 3.6.1`.\r\n\r\nI'm doing this thing:\r\n<img width=\"70\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8379098/188685130-d23c9cf5-085f-47d7-b4a2-91cd16aa3046.png\">\r\n\r\nIn `classNames` I write this:\r\n```jsx\r\n<div\r\n  className={clsx(\r\n    \"[clip-path:circle(100%_at_center)]\",\r\n    \"[mask-image:radial-gradient(circle_at_center,transparent_51%,black_54.8%)]\",\r\n    \"bg-[conic-gradient(transparent,#9e9ab1)]\",\r\n    \"pointer-events-none h-6 w-6 animate-spin rounded-full\"\r\n  )}\r\n/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nEverything is displayed as it should.

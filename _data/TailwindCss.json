Eg. \r\n\r\n## CSS properties missing\r\nCurrent\r\n```css\r\n.transition {\r\n    transition-property: color, background-color, border-color, text-decoration-color, fill, stroke, opacity, box-shadow, transform, translate, scale, rotate, filter, -webkit-backdrop-filter, backdrop-filter;\r\n    transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);\r\n    transition-duration: 150ms;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nShloud be\r\n```css\r\n.transition {\r\n    transition-property: color, background-color, border-color, text-decoration-color, fill, stroke, opacity, box-shadow, transform, translate, scale, rotate, filter, -webkit-backdrop-filter, backdrop-filter;\r\n    transition-timing-function: var(--transition-timing-function-in-out, cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1));\r\n    transition-duration: var(--default-transition-duration, 150ms);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## transition-property\r\nAlso the same should be applied to `transition-property`, but I didn't find how this can be changed.

The default color for `shadow-xl` for instance is `rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1)`, and the only way to get that color back after changing it is to know that value and explicitly bring it back:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"shadow-lg shadow-red-500 hover:shadow-xl hover:shadow-black/10\">\r\n  <!-- … -->\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo make things more difficult, the default shadow color is not the same across shadow sizes. For `shadow-sm` it's `black/5`, and for `shadow-2xl` it's `black/25`.\r\n\r\nIn practice though you basically never need to bring back the default shadow color, so I'm reconsidering this trade-off in v4, and think I prefer this new behavior where the color is preserved but you have to bring back the default color if you actually need it.\r\n\r\nA simple workaround if you don't know the color is to reset the `--tw-shadow-color` variable like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"shadow-lg shadow-red-500 hover:shadow-xl hover:[--tw-shadow-color:initial]\">\r\n  <!-- … -->\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis relies on semi-private internals though, so perhaps we can introduce a utility for this, like `shadow-default` or `shadow-initial` that just unsets the shadow color.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14458","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Preserve shadow color when overriding shadow size\" (#14458)"},{"Id":"2535775768","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-19T09:19:57","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"14459","RawContent":null,"Title":"Experiment with ReFS","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14459","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Experiment with ReFS\" (#14459)"},{"Id":"2534185687","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-18T16:27:30","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"14457","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update typescript 5.5.4 → 5.6.2 (minor)","State":"open","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

To correctly migrate this to `@utility` directives, we have to register each class in the selector and generate `n` utilities.\n\nWe can use nesting syntax, and replace the current class with `&` to ensure that the final result behaves the same.\n\nInput:\n```css\n@layer utilities {\n  .foo .bar .baz {\n    color: red;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n```css\n@utility foo {\n  & .bar .baz {\n    color: red;\n  }\n}\n\n@utility bar {\n  .foo & .baz {\n    color: red;\n  }\n}\n\n@utility .baz {\n  .foo .bar & {\n    color: red;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, it could be that you know that some of them will never be used as a utility (e.g.: `hover:bar`), but then you can safely remove them.\n\n---\n\nEven classes inside of `:has(…)` will become a utility. The only exception to the rule is that we don't do it for `:not(…)`.\n\nInput:\n```css\n@layer utilities {\n  .foo .bar:not(.qux):has(.baz) {\n    display: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n```css\n@utility foo {\n  & .bar:not(.qux):has(.baz) {\n    display: none;\n  }\n}\n\n@utility bar {\n  .foo &:not(.qux):has(.baz) {\n    display: none;\n  }\n}\n\n@utility baz {\n  .foo .bar:not(.qux):has(&) {\n    display: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNotice that there is no `@utility qux` because it was used inside of `:not(…)`.\n\n---\n\nWhen classes are nested inside at-rules, then these classes will also become utilities. However, the `@utility <name>` will be at the top and the at-rules will live inside of it. If there are multiple classes inside a shared at-rule, then the at-rule will be duplicated for each class.\n\nLet's look at an example to make it more clear:\n\nInput:\n```css\n@layer utilities {\n  @media (min-width: 640px) {\n    .foo {\n      color: red;\n    }\n\n    .bar {\n      color: blue;\n    }\n\n    @media (min-width: 1024px) {\n      .baz {\n        color: green;\n      }\n\n      @media (min-width: 1280px) {\n        .qux {\n          color: yellow;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n```css\n@utility foo {\n  @media (min-width: 640px) {\n    color: red;\n  }\n}\n\n@utility bar {\n  @media (min-width: 640px) {\n    color: blue;\n  }\n}\n\n@utility baz {\n  @media (min-width: 640px) {\n    @media (min-width: 1024px) {\n      color: green;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n@utility qux {\n  @media (min-width: 640px) {\n    @media (min-width: 1024px) {\n      @media (min-width: 1280px) {\n        color: yellow;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nWhen classes result in multiple `@utility` directives with the same name, then the definitions will be merged together.\n\nInput:\n```css\n@layer utilities {\n  .no-scrollbar::-webkit-scrollbar {\n    display: none;\n  }\n\n  .no-scrollbar {\n    -ms-overflow-style: none;\n    scrollbar-width: none;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIntermediate representation:\n```css\n@utility no-scrollbar {\n  &::-webkit-scrollbar {\n    display: none;\n  }\n}\n\n@utility no-scrollbar {\n  -ms-overflow-style: none;\n  scrollbar-width: none;\n}\n```\n\nOutput:\n```css\n@utility no-scrollbar {\n  &::-webkit-scrollbar {\n    display: none;\n  }\n  -ms-overflow-style: none;\n  scrollbar-width: none\n}\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14455","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add CSS codemods for migrating `@layer utilities`\" (#14455)"},{"Id":"2531351415","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-18T12:59:39","Actor":"adamwathan","Number":"14447","RawContent":null,"Title":"Explicitly ignore `--inset-shadow` and `--inset-ring` variables in `inset` handler","State":"closed","Body":"Resolves #14440.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where registering a custom `inset-shadow-*` utility value in your theme like this:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@theme {\r\n  --inset-shadow-potato: inset 0px 2px 6px #7a4724;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n…mistakenly generates both an `inset-shadow-*` and `inset-*` utility with that value:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.inset-shadow-potato {\r\n  inset: inset 0px 2px 6px #7a4724;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.inset-shadow-potato {\r\n  box-shadow: inset 0px 2px 6px #7a4724;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis replaces #14445 which turns out to not be the ideal solution.\r\n\r\nNow we just explicitly ignore variables like `--inset-shadow-*` and `--inset-ring-*` in the `inset` handler.

This means that our clients (PostCSS, Vite, and CLI) no longer need to depend on `postcss` and `postcss-import` to resolve `@import`. Furthermore this simplifies the handling of relative paths for `@source`, `@plugin`, or `@config` in transitive CSS files (where the relative root should always be relative to the CSS file that contains the directive). This PR also fixes a plugin resolution bug where non-relative imports (e.g. directly importing node modules like `@plugin '@tailwindcss/typography';`) would not work in CSS files that are based in a different npm package.\r\n\r\n### Resolving `@import`\r\n\r\nThe core of the `@import` resolution is inside `packages/tailwindcss/src/at-import.ts`. There, to keep things performant, we do a two-step process to resolve imports. Imagine the following input CSS file:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@import \"tailwindcss/theme.css\";\r\n@import \"tailwindcss/utilities.css\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince our AST walks are synchronous, we will do a first traversal where we start a loading request for each `@import` directive. Once all loads are started, we will await the promise and do a second walk where we actually replace the AST nodes with their resolved stylesheets. All of this is recursive, so that `@import`-ed files can again `@import` other files. \r\n\r\nThe core `@import` resolver also includes extensive test cases for [various combinations of media query and supports conditionals as well als layered imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@import).\r\n\r\nWhen the same file is imported multiple times, the AST nodes are duplicated but duplicate I/O is avoided on a per-file basis, so this will only load one file, but include the `@theme` rules twice:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@import \"tailwindcss/theme.css\";\r\n@import \"tailwindcss/theme.css\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Adding a new `context` node to the AST\r\n\r\nOne limitation we had when working with the `postcss-import` plugin was the need to do an additional traversal to rewrite relative `@source`, `@plugin`, and `@config` directives. This was needed because we want these paths to be relative to the CSS file that defines the directive but when flattening a CSS file, this information is no longer part of the stringifed CSS representation. We worked around this by rewriting the content of these directives to be relative to the input CSS file, which resulted in added complexity and caused a lot of issues with Windows paths in the beginning.\r\n\r\nNow that we are doing the `@import` resolution in core, we can use a different data structure to persist this information. This PR adds a new `context` node so that we can store arbitrary context like this inside the Ast directly. This allows us to share information with the sub tree _while doing the Ast walk_.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of how the new `context` node can be used to share information with subtrees:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst ast = [\r\n  rule('.foo', [decl('color', 'red')]),\r\n  context({ value: 'a' }, [\r\n    rule('.bar', [\r\n      decl('color', 'blue'),\r\n      context({ value: 'b' }, [\r\n        rule('.baz', [decl('color', 'green')]),\r\n      ]),\r\n    ]),\r\n  ]),\r\n]\r\n\r\nwalk(ast, (node, { context }) => {\r\n  if (node.kind !== 'declaration') return\r\n  switch (node.value) {\r\n    case 'red':   assert(context.value === undefined)\r\n    case 'blue':  assert(context.value === 'a')\r\n    case 'green': assert(context.value === 'b')\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn core, we use this new Ast node specifically to persist the `base` path of the current CSS file. We put the input CSS file `base` at the root of the Ast and then overwrite the `base` on every `@import` substitution. \r\n\r\n### Removing the dependency on `postcss-import`\r\n\r\nNow that we support `@import` resolution in core, our clients no longer need a dependency on `postcss-import`. Furthermore, most dependencies also don't need to know about `postcss` at all anymore (except the PostCSS client, of course!).\r\n\r\nThis also means that our workaround for rewriting `@source`, the `postcss-fix-relative-paths` plugin, can now go away as a shared dependency between all of our clients. Note that we still have it for the PostCSS plugin only, where it's possible that users already have `postcss-import` running _before_ the `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of the changes to the dependencies for our Vite client ✨ :\r\n\r\n<img width=\"854\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 16 59 45\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae1f9d5f-d93a-4de9-9244-61af3aff1237\">\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\nSince our Vite and CLI clients now no longer need to use `postcss` at all, we have also measured a significant improvement to the initial build times. For a small test setup that contains only a hand full of files (nothing super-complex), we measured an improvement in the **3.5x** range:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1334\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-09-19 at 14 52 49\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06071fb0-7f2a-4de6-8ec8-f202d2cc78e5\">\r\n\r\nThe code for this is in the commit history if you want to reproduce the results. The test was based on the Vite client.\r\n\r\n### Caveats\r\n\r\nOne thing to note is that we previously relied on finding specific symbols in the input CSS to _bail out of Tailwind processing completely_. E.g. if a file does not contain a `@tailwind` or `@apply` directive, it can never be a Tailwind file. \r\n\r\nSince we no longer have a string representation of the flattened CSS file, we can no longer do this check. However, the current implementation was already inconsistent with differences on the allowed symbol list between our clients. Ideally, Tailwind CSS should figure out wether a CSS file is a Tailwind CSS file. This, however, is left as an improvement for a future API since it goes hand-in-hand with our planned API changes for the core `tailwindcss` package.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14446","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Resolve `@import` in core\" (#14446)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2024-09-21T03:30:25.0083638Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":526}

The issue occurred after migrating the [Valibot docs](https://valibot.dev/) [in this PR](https://github.com/fabian-hiller/valibot/pull/1248) to Tailwind v4. \n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nI am using `@custom-variant dark (&:where(.dark, .dark *))` to overwrite the default `prefers-color-scheme` behavior, but Tailwind loads inconsistent CSS code in dev mode. It loads an `index.css` file from the Tailwind `node_modules` folder, as well as my own custom `root.css` file, which includes `@import 'tailwindcss'`. My CSS file includes the correct dark mode declarations, but the `index.css` file does not, which mixes up the declarations if you choose a color mode that is not the current `prefers-color-scheme`.\n\n<img width=\"1922\" height=\"940\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf04da75-2b34-4a8c-ab87-30577539a51e\" />\n\nSo I ended up with two versions of Tailwind  v4.1.11, each with CSS declarations that contradict each other.\n\n<img width=\"1682\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7600609-fa18-4a8a-885e-ec417c7669b2\" />\n\nI have already tried various methods of debugging and fixing it, but with no success.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18539","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Problem with dark mode because Tailwind v4 loads two CSS versions in dev mode\" (#18539)"},{"Id":"3229150681","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-14T15:59:51","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"18535","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update @emnapi/core 1.4.3 → 1.4.4 (patch)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

This breaks the CSS and results in styles not rendering properly on the page.\n\nI'm using the latest version of `tailwind` in a `sveltekit` project with the default configuration. I also tested this in the official `tw` playground and I see the same behavior. Screenshots are attached so you can immediately see that something's wrong.\n\n<img width=\"375\" height=\"165\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e57fd84-205a-4972-b4b2-4985582f8faf\" />\n\n<img width=\"946\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e8270f5-f457-4ca4-90d6-aebc825f7742\" />\n\n<img width=\"347\" height=\"155\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cebcd21f-f6f8-4b8a-9738-0ef031dd9ef0\" />\n\n[Playground link](https://play.tailwindcss.com/U04WjTgJzA?file=css)\n\nI spent more than half an hour trying to find the problem. After renaming the custom variable, everything worked fine again. I believe this should be addressed, since CSS variables `--custom-name` and `tw` utilities `.custom-name` are diffirent concepts and shouldn't interfere with each other.\n\nI'm running into this because I want to define a custom utils and vars for variable font in the `@theme` config:\n\n```css\n@theme {\n  --font-400: 'wght' 400;\n  --font-ss-3: 'ss03' 1;\n}\n```\n\nSo I can use it later with custom util:\n\n```css\n@utility font-400 {\n  font-variation-settings: var(--font-400);\n}\n\n@utility font-ss-3 {\n  font-feature-settings: var(--font-ss-3);\n}\n```\n\nor via custom css directly if needed:\n\n```css\np {\n  font-variation-settings: var(--font-600);\n  font-feature-settings: var(--font-ss-3);\n}\n```\n\nThese variable names should remain isolated, custom properties under `@theme` shouldn’t conflict with custom `@utilities`.\n\n**In short**: everything works as expected unless a custom `@theme` variable shares its name with a custom `@utility`, in that case, CSS breaks due to conflicting class generation.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18529","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Unexpected behavior when custom `@theme` vars and `@utility` share same names\" (#18529)"},{"Id":"3223761839","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-14T14:06:09","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"18513","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update eslint 9.29.0 → 9.30.1 (minor)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

This pattern worked in Tailwind CSS v3 but appears broken in v4.\n\nIn particular, combining `@apply` with responsive and pseudo-class utilities inside Angular's SCSS context (`::ng-deep`) no longer compiles or applies styles as it used to.\n\n---\n\n### Example SCSS Code Illustrating the Problem:\n\n```scss\n@use '@angular/material' as mat;\n@reference 'tailwindcss';\n\n:host {\n  ::ng-deep {\n    .task-list {\n      @include mat.form-field-density(-1);\n\n      @apply hover:md:bg-red-500; // ❌ Not working in v4, worked in v3\n\n      &:hover {\n        @apply md:bg-red-500; // ❌ Not working in v4, worked in v3\n      }\n\n      .mdc-label {\n        @apply font-medium text-red-500; // ✅ Still works\n      }\n\n      .mat-mdc-checkbox-checked {\n        @apply pointer-events-none opacity-50;\n\n        .mdc-label {\n          @apply line-through!; // ✅ Still works\n        }\n      }\n\n      .action-trigger {\n        @apply md:opacity-0; // ❌ Not working as it did in v3 — no longer hidden on large screens\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThese patterns are used widely across our large Angular application, and after the v4 upgrade, many component styles have silently broken. While base utilities like `@apply text-red-500` still function, any usage of `@apply` with media queries or pseudo-classes(hover,placeholder...) appears to be ignored or stripped during build.\n\n### Impact\nThis is a critical issue for us:\n- We have a large codebase heavily reliant on these patterns.\n- Refactoring hundreds of components manually would be a major setback.\n- There was no mention of this change in the upgrade guide as of now.\n\n### Please confirm:\n\n- Is this behavior expected in Tailwind CSS v4?\n- Was support for `@apply + media/pseudo` utilities removed by design?\n- If so, is there a workaround or plugin we can adopt short-term?\n\nAny guidance or fix would be hugely appreciated. We're happy to provide further context or contribute to a fix if this is unintended.\n\nThank you!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18519","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[v4] Regression: Media queries inside @apply not working as expected compared to v3\" (#18519)"},{"Id":"3225388864","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-12T17:40:26","Actor":"mwnciau","Number":"18516","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unable to set property value to \"inherit\" in the CSS config","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\nv4.0.9\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nElixir Phoenix using the Tailwind 0.3.1 elixir package, built using the esbuild 0.9.0 elixir package, which is using esbuild 0.17.11\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nv22.16.0\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nFirefox\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nUbuntu\n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\nhttps://play.tailwindcss.com/vJ8zniNWjT\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nIt is impossible to set a custom theme variable to \"inherit\" using a CSS config.

While both the original hex value (e.g., #fb2c3600) and the color-mix output are fully transparent, they are not identical.\n\nThis bug can lead to unexpected behavior because #fb2c3600 is not the same as #0000, which is the effective result of the color-mix fallback.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**\n\n```\n@theme {\n  --color-red-a0: --alpha(var(--color-red-500) / 0%);\n  --color-red-a50: --alpha(var(--color-red-500) / 50%);\n}\n```\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\n```\n@layer theme {\n  :root,\n  :host {\n  --color-red-a0: #fb2c3600;\n  --color-red-a50: #fb2c3680;\n\n  @supports (color: lab(0% 0 0)) {\n    --color-red-a0: lab(55.4814% 75.0732 48.8528 / 0%);\n    --color-red-a50: lab(55.4814% 75.0732 48.8528 / 50%);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Actual behavior**\n\n```\n@layer theme {\n  :root,\n  :host {\n  --color-red-a0: #0000;\n  --color-red-a50: #fb2c3680;\n\n  @supports (color: color-mix(in lab, red, red)) {\n    :root,\n    :host {\n      --color-red-a0: color-mix(in oklab, var(--color-red-500) 0%, transparent);\n      --color-red-a50: color-mix(in oklab, var(--color-red-500) 50%, transparent);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nwhere --color-red-a50 are the same in both cases, but --color-red-a0 are not. \n\n**Why this matters**\n\nWhile both colors #fb2c3600 and #0000 are fully transparent, the loss of the original components can lead to incorrect rendering in specific scenarios where the browser relies on the underlying color values. For example, in CSS Gradients: when creating a gradient that fades to transparency (e.g., linear-gradient(#fb2c36, #fb2c3600)), the browser smoothly transitions from the solid color to a transparent version of the same color. However, with the bug, the gradient would transition to transparent black, which can create an unintended visual shift toward black before fading out.\n\nThis behavior violates the principle of least astonishment by discarding explicit user data and is a critical flaw for projects relying on precise color management.\n\n**Playground link**\n[https://play.tailwindcss.com/Xjil35jX2I](https://play.tailwindcss.com/Xjil35jX2I)","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18508","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"--alpha function loses base color for fully transparent hex values\" (#18508)"},{"Id":"3220240794","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-10T18:58:29","Actor":"TruffleClock","Number":"18503","RawContent":null,"Title":"`shadow-md` is broken on iOS 26","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

The new engine and the dedicated Vite plugin are exciting developments.\n\nI was recently setting up a new project to try out `@tailwindcss/vite` as an all-in-one replacement for the older PostCSS setup. My mental model, based on past experience, was that the plugin would automatically find my `tailwind.config.js` at the project root and use it to configure everything. During this process, I ran into some interesting behavior that I wanted to share.\n\nTo understand it better, I created a minimal reproduction repository, which can be found here:\n➡️ https://github.com/philippedev101/tailwind-vite-bug-repro\n\nTo trace the issue, I also cloned the `tailwindcss` and `vite` repositories locally and used `pnpm overrides` to point the MRE to my local builds. I then instrumented several files with extensive logging. (As a side note, I did have to patch the `exports` map in `tailwindcss/package.json` to get the local package to import correctly in my project, changing the `\"import\"` field from `src/index.ts` to `dist/lib.mjs`.)\n\nThe minimal repo uses a standard setup, but with one key feature: the main CSS file is in a subdirectory (`src/client/main.css`). The `pnpm overrides` can be removed and the issue still persists with the official npm packages.\n\n### The Core Observation\n\nWhen I run the MRE, I see very specific and seemingly contradictory behavior:\n*   Classes from the `safelist` in my `tailwind.config.js` (like `.rotate-12`) are correctly generated in the final CSS.\n*   Utility classes used in my `content` files (like `.text-blue-500` in `index.html`) are not detected and are missing from the final CSS.\n\nThis suggests that the config file is being found and read, but that the `content` property is being handled differently or ignored by the content scanning pipeline.\n\n### The Debugging Trace\n\nMy logging within the local builds revealed a very specific chain of events that seems to cause this:\n\n1.  Incorrect `base` path calculation in the Vite Plugin.\n    In `packages/@tailwindcss-vite/src/index.ts`, the `Root.generate()` method calculates a base path from the directory of the CSS file being processed, not the Vite project root.\n    *   It correctly has `this.base = \"/path/to/repro\"`.\n    *   But it calculates and uses `inputBase = \"/path/to/repro/src/client\"`.\n    *   It then calls the core `compile` function with this incorrect `inputBase`.\n\n2.  The `compat` Layer Receives the Wrong Path.\n    The core engine's `parseCss` function (in `packages/tailwindcss/src/index.ts`) receives this incorrect `base` path and passes it down to `applyCompatibilityHooks` in `packages/tailwindcss/src/compat/apply-compat-hooks.ts`.\n\n3.  Config Resolution Fails to Process User `content`.\n    The `applyCompatibilityHooks` function is responsible for finding and merging configs.\n    *   Because our CSS doesn't use an explicit `@config` directive, the function enters a path to find an implicit `tailwind.config.js`.\n    *   However, its call to `upgradeToFullPluginSupport` and the subsequent calls to `resolveConfig` (in `packages/tailwindcss/src/compat/config/resolve-config.ts`) end up processing only the built-in default theme config.\n    *   Crucially, the user's `tailwind.config.js` is never added to the list of `files` for the `resolveConfig` function to process for its `content` key.\n\n4.  An Empty `content` Array is Returned.\n    Because the user's config was never processed for its `content` key in this pipeline, the `resolveConfig` function returns a final, merged config where `content.files` is an empty array.\n\n5.  The `vite` Plugin's Fallback is Triggered.\n    The `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin receives this resolved config with no content sources. It then activates its own fallback logic, setting the scanner to watch `/*` in the project root. This is a very broad pattern that doesn't respect the specific, more efficient globs defined in our actual `tailwind.config.js`.\n\nSummary of Findings:\n\nIt appears there are two separate config-loading mechanisms at play. One process seems to correctly find `tailwind.config.js` and process the `safelist`, but a second, more complex process, initiated by the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin, fails. This second process fails because the plugin passes an incorrect base path to the core engine's compatibility layer, which then doesn't correctly load the `content` property from the user's config file, causing the JIT scanner to not work as intended.\n\n### A Few Questions\n\nThis deep dive left me with a few questions about the intended design, which would be super helpful to understand:\n\n1.  Is it the intended behavior for the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin to use the CSS file's directory as the `base` for config resolution, instead of the Vite project root?\n2.  The `compat` layer's `resolveConfig` doesn't seem to perform an upward search for a config file. Is that the expected logic for that part of the system?\n3.  Most importantly, what is the recommended way to set up a project like the MRE? It would be incredibly helpful to see a reference example of `@tailwindcss/vite` being used without a PostCSS pipeline where the CSS entry point is in a subdirectory.\n\nThank you again for your time and for looking into this. I'm really excited about where the project is headed!\n\n### Environment\n\n-   OS: Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS\n-   Node.js: v22.17.0\n-   pnpm: 10.12.4\n-   Rust: rustc 1.88.0 (6b00bc388 2025-06-23)\n-   Shell: zsh 5.9\n-   Tailwind CSS Commit: `b24457a9f4101f20a3c3ab8df39debe87564fe8a`\n-   Vite Commit: `2e8050e4cd8835673baf07375b7db35128144222`","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18468","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Investigating Inconsistent Config Loading with @tailwindcss/vite\" (#18468)"},{"Id":"3206866542","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-06T18:28:56","Actor":"HappyLDE","Number":"18466","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] @tailwindcss/postcss Fails to Generate Utility Classes for In-Memory Content","State":"closed","Body":"# [v4] @tailwindcss/postcss Fails to Generate Utility Classes for In-Memory Content\n\n## Describe the bug\nWhen using `@tailwindcss/postcss@4.1.11` with PostCSS to process in-memory content, Tailwind fails to generate utility classes (e.g., `bg-blue-500`). The output only contains the banner (`/*! tailwindcss v4.x.x | MIT License | https://tailwindcss.com */`). No errors or warnings are reported. File-based content scanning also fails with the same issue. This does not occur with Tailwind v3.4.14 in the same setup.\n\n## To Reproduce\n1. Create `test-in-memory.js`:\n   ```javascript\n   const postcss = require(\"postcss\");\n   const tailwindcss = require(\"@tailwindcss/postcss\");\n\n   const html = '<div class=\"bg-blue-500\">Hello</div>';\n   const config = {\n     content: [{ raw: html }],\n   };\n\n   const cssInput = `\n   @tailwind utilities;\n   `;\n\n   console.log(\"Input HTML:\", html);\n   console.log(\"Tailwind plugin loaded:\", !!tailwindcss);\n   console.log(\"Node.js version:\", process.version);\n   console.log(\"Processing with config:\", JSON.stringify(config, null, 2));\n\n   const processor = postcss([tailwindcss(config)]);\n   console.log(\"PostCSS plugins:\", processor.plugins.map(p => p.postcssPlugin));\n\n   processor\n     .process(cssInput, { from: undefined, to: undefined })\n     .then((result) => {\n       console.log(\"Generated CSS:\", result.css);\n       console.log(\"CSS length:\", result.css.length);\n       console.log(\"Warnings:\", result.warnings().map(w => w.text));\n       if (!result.css.includes(\"bg-blue-500\")) {\n         console.warn(\"Warning: Expected class (bg-blue-500) not found in output.\");\n       } else {\n         console.log(\"Success: Expected class (bg-blue-500) found in output.\");\n       }\n     })\n     .catch((error) => {\n       console.error(\"Error processing CSS:\", error.message, error.stack);\n     });\n   ```\n2. Install dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   npm install postcss@8.5.6 @tailwindcss/postcss@4.1.11 tailwindcss@4.1.11\n   ```\n3. Run:\n   ```bash\n   node test-in-memory.js\n   ```\n\n## Expected behavior\nGenerated CSS should include:\n```css\n.bg-blue-500 {\n  background-color: #3b82f6;\n}\n```\n\n## Actual behavior\nGenerated CSS:\n```css\n/*! tailwindcss v4.0.7 | MIT License | https://tailwindcss.com */\n```\n- CSS length: 67\n- Warnings: []\n\n## Environment\n- **Node.js**: v22.12.0\n- **npm**: v10.9.0\n- **OS**: Linux 6.15.4-200.fc42.x86_64\n- **Dependencies**:\n  - `postcss@8.5.6`\n  - `@tailwindcss/postcss@4.0.7` (also tested with `@tailwindcss/postcss@4.1.11`)\n  - `@tailwindcss/node@4.0.7` (installed as a dependency)\n  - `tailwindcss@4.0.7` (installed as a dependency)\n\n## Additional context\n- File-based content (e.g., `content: [\"./test.html\"]` with `<div class=\"bg-blue-500\">Hello</div>`) produces the same result.\n- The CLI (`@tailwindcss/node@4.0.7` or `@tailwindcss/node@4.1.11`) fails due to a missing `node_modules/.bin/tailwindcss` binary.\n- Tailwind v3.4.14 works correctly with both file-based and in-memory content in the same setup.\n- PostCSS plugins reported: `['tailwindcss-postcss-fix-relative-paths', 'tailwindcss']`.\n- No errors or warnings are logged, suggesting a silent failure in content scanning.\n\n## Possible Cause\nThis may be related to compatibility issues with Node.js v22.12.0 or a bug in `@tailwindcss/postcss@4.0.7` and `@tailwindcss/postcss@4.1.11` for in-memory content scanning.

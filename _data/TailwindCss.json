The process completed without errors, but the styles are no longer applied after the migration.\r\n\r\nInitially, I suspected the issue might be related to the prefix configuration, so I created a separate branch (no-prefix) to test the migration without a prefix. Unfortunately, the result was the same.\r\n\r\nHere are the relevant branches in the reproduction repository:\r\n- main: Stable working version on Tailwind v3\r\n- tailwind-4: Migrated to Tailwind v4 (non-functional)\r\n- no-prefix: Migrated to Tailwind v4 without prefix (non-functional)\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/dcheglakov/angular-tailwind.\r\n1. Check out the tailwind-4 or no-prefix branch.\r\n1. Build and serve the Angular app.\r\n1. Notice that the styles are not applied.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nThe styles should work as they did in Tailwind CSS v3 after the migration process.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\nI followed the migration steps provided in the [Tailwind CSS upgrade guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide). Both the tailwind-4 and no-prefix branches demonstrate the issue.

The issue with this is that in a lot of cases, the CSS files aren't even related to Tailwind CSS at all.\r\n\r\nE.g.: in a Next.js project, if you use the `next/font/local` tool, then every font you used will be in a separate CSS file. This means that we run Tailwind CSS in all these files as well.\r\n\r\nThat said, running Tailwind CSS on these files isn't the end of the world because we still need to handle `@import` in case `@tailwind utilities` is being used. However, we also run the auto source detection logic for every CSS file in the system. This part is bad.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, this PR introduces an internal `features` to collect what CSS features are used throughout the system (`@import`, `@plugin`, `@apply`, `@tailwind utilities`, etc…)\r\n\r\nThe `@tailwindcss/postcss` and `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin can use that information to decide if they can take some shortcuts or not.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOverall, this means that we don't run the slow parts of Tailwind CSS if we don't need to.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/15226","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Improve performance of `@tailwindcss/postcss` and `@tailwindcss/vite`\" (#15226)"},{"Id":"2705368109","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-29T14:55:09","Actor":"spaceemotion","Number":"15241","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] Styling doesn't get applied properly to ::after elements","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

And it does, with local file imports. However, it is missing support for remote url imports. Currently, nothing happens when you import from an http url. The compiled output just leaves the import in (like the line `@import \"https://example.com/styles.css\";` is in the compiled output directly, and is not fetched and inlined in). Now that the configuration file is \"just\" a css file, it feels like this should be possible.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the desired behavior would be here. If it is intended that remote imports do not work, I think it should be documented.\r\n\r\nI do have a use case for this, where I want a \"base\" theme configuration which my custom plugins to \"inherit\" from. It would be great to have the build and intellisense work with my base theme, without copy/pasting in the \"base\" into every plugin. (note that by plugin, I do not mean a tailwind plugin, but rather a plugin for my own app which can add its own markup that may include tailwind styles which need to be compiled).","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/15231","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[v4] HTTP (remote) imports\" (#15231)"},{"Id":"2702855790","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-28T17:35:16","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"15228","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add `@import \"…\" reference`","State":"open","Body":"This PR adds a new feature, `@import \"…\" reference` that can be used to load Tailwind CSS configuration files without adding any style rules to the CSS.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that you can use this in combination with your Tailwind CSS root file when you need to have access to your full CSS config outside of the main stylesheet. A common example is for Vue, Svelte, or CSS modules:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@import \"./tailwind.css\" reference;\r\n\r\n.link {\r\n  @apply underline;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nImporting a file as a reference will convert all `@theme` block to be `reference`, so no CSS variables will be emitted. Furthermore it will strip out all custom styles from the stylesheet. Furthermore plugins registered via `@plugin` or `@config` inside reference-mode files will not add any content to the CSS file via `addBase()`.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nAdded unit test for when we handle the import resolution and when `postcss-import` does it outside of Tailwind CSS.

The problem is that lightningcss now needs to convert `oklch` colors into the `oklab` space to inline some `color-mix()` functions.\r\n\r\nThe problem, though, is that this calculation seems to have rounding differences between macOS, Linux, and Windows. Since we still want to _define the default color space in `oklch`_ and _use lightningcss as a post-processor in our unit tests so we have a better coverage of the output_, this PR attempts to fix the issue by adding a custom vitest serializer. It will find usages of the `oklab()` function with arguments that have lots of decimal places (at least 6 decimal places).

When this crafted request is sent it could coerce Next.js to cache a route that is meant to not be cached and send a <code class=\"notranslate\">Cache-Control: s-maxage=1, stale-while-revalidate</code> header which some upstream CDNs may cache as well.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">To be potentially affected all of the following must apply:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Next.js between 13.5.1 and 14.2.9</li>\n<li>Using pages router</li>\n<li>Using non-dynamic server-side rendered routes e.g. <code class=\"notranslate\">pages/dashboard.tsx</code> not <code class=\"notranslate\">pages/blog/[slug].tsx</code>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">The below configurations are unaffected:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Deployments using only app router</li>\n<li>Deployments on <a href=\"https://vercel.com/\">Vercel</a> are not affected</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Patches</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This vulnerability was resolved in Next.js v13.5.7, v14.2.10, and later. We recommend upgrading regardless of whether you can reproduce the issue or not.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Workarounds</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">There are no official or recommended workarounds for this issue, we recommend that users patch to a safe version.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"auto\">Credits</h4>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Allam Rachid (zhero_)</li>\n<li>Henry Chen</li>\n</ul></blockquote>\n<h4><a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/vercel/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-fr5h-rqp8-mj6g\">🚨 Next.js Server-Side Request Forgery in Server Actions</a></h4>\n<blockquote><h3 dir=\"auto\">Impact</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was identified in Next.js Server Actions by security researchers at Assetnote.

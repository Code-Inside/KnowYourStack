This compatibility is crucial for maintaining our project's code formatting standards and utility functionality.\r\n\r\n### Affected Plugins\r\n- `@softonus/prettier-plugin-duplicate-remover`\r\n- `@softonus/prettier-plugin-whitespace-remover`\r\n\r\n### Desired Outcome\r\nThe desired outcome is for these plugins to function correctly when placed before the Tailwind CSS plugin in the Prettier configuration file. This would allow for better flexibility in managing code formatting and style consistency.\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n- When these plugins are placed before the Tailwind plugin: They do not function as expected.\r\n- When placed after the Tailwind plugin: They lead to the Tailwind plugin being disabled.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Set up a project with Prettier and Tailwind CSS.\r\n2. Install and configure the aforementioned plugins in the `.prettierrc` file.\r\n3. Arrange the plugins before the Tailwind CSS plugin and attempt to format the files.\r\n4. Observe the lack of expected functionality from the plugins.\r\n\r\n### Suggested Solution\r\nInvestigate potential changes or enhancements in the plugin architecture or initialization sequence that would allow these plugins to operate effectively when configured before the Tailwind CSS plugin. This might involve modifications to how plugins are loaded or processed by Prettier when working with CSS frameworks like Tailwind.\r\n\r\n### Beneficial Side Effect:\r\nImplementing this change will also have the added advantage of negating the need for the Tailwind plugin to include its own duplicate and whitespace remover functionalities. This would not only streamline the Tailwind plugin but also reduce redundancy and potential conflicts between these utilities.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate your consideration and any efforts to enhance the compatibility of these tools, which are crucial for our development workflows.\r\n\r\nThey should be added to this file: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss/blob/3c9ce4e488c09851be1d5be37940b39679e10c1c/src/plugins.js#L174\r\n\r\n``` let plugins = [\r\n    '@ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports',\r\n    '@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports',\r\n    'prettier-plugin-organize-imports',\r\n    'prettier-plugin-css-order',\r\n    'prettier-plugin-import-sort',\r\n    'prettier-plugin-jsdoc',\r\n    'prettier-plugin-organize-attributes',\r\n    'prettier-plugin-style-order',\r\n    'prettier-plugin-sort-imports',\r\n    '@softonus/prettier-plugin-whitespace-remover',   // <- this one\r\n    '@softonus/prettier-plugin-duplicate-remover'   // and this one\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n</div>","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13708","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Prettier Plugin] Handle two more plugins\" (#13708)"},{"Id":"2304313768","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-18T21:45:51","Actor":"MrOxMasTer","Number":"13705","RawContent":null,"Title":"```content.transform``` doesn't work in next.js","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

The repo currently has 2 workspaces: `app` for the React app, and `preset` which exports a Tailwind preset with themes and a plugin.\r\n\r\nThe (abridged) project layout:\r\n\r\n```\r\n├── package.json\r\n├── app\r\n│   ├── package.json\r\n│   ├── postcss.config.js\r\n│   ├── tailwind.config.js\r\n│   └── vite.config.ts\r\n└── preset\r\n    ├── package.json\r\n    └── src\r\n        └── index.ts\r\n```\r\n\r\n`app/tailwind.config.js`\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport preset from \"preset\";\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  content: [\"./index.html\", \"./src/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx}\"],\r\n  presets: [preset],\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I run `vite` in dev mode, Vite server sets up \"hot module reload\" which enables automatically reloading the page on file changes.\r\n\r\nWhen I change `tailwind.config.js`, Vite HMR is able to reprocess CSS and automatically update styles. When I update styles in the `preset` workspace, Vite does not reprocess CSS, and styles are not updated, even after manually refreshing the page. The only way to force Vite to reprocess CSS is to restart the Vite server.\r\n\r\n**Intuition**\r\n\r\nIt could be that `scanDir` used [here](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/5e737d858755a7149e17b5f3feaeb0d42865354d/packages/%40tailwindcss-postcss/src/index.ts#L106-L107) is unable to scan directories outside of `base`, which doesn't let it [report those files as `dependency`](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/5e737d858755a7149e17b5f3feaeb0d42865354d/packages/%40tailwindcss-postcss/src/index.ts#L109-L130) (or `dir-dependency`) to Vite.

However, they can _also_ use CSS custom properties that point to another dashed ident.\n\nE.g.:\n\n```css\n.foo {\n  --target: --sidebar;\n  anchor-name: var(--target);\n}\n```\n\nA workaround that some people used is adding a `_` in front of the variable: `mt-[_--my-thing]` this way we don't automatically inject the `var(…)` around it. This is a workaround and gross.\n\nWhile the idea of automatic var injection is neat, this causes more trouble than it's worth. Adding `var(…)` explicitly is better.\n\nA side effect of this is that we can simplify the internals for the `candidate` data structure because we don't need to track `dashedIdent` separately anymore.\n\n\n<!--\n\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

Will share a lot more about what Oxide is and when we really want people to start playing with it when it's a bit further along over the coming weeks.\r\n\r\n## How it works\r\n\r\nGetting this to _\"just work\"_ given all of the different places people use Tailwind is a serious challenge. This first stab at the problem uses a few heuristics and assumptions that are working very well for the types of projects we've tested it in:\r\n\r\n- **Files are scanned using the current working directory** ‚Äî there's no magical way to know what the \"root\" of your project is, so Tailwind assumes that the current working directory is the root of your project. You should always run your build scripts from the root of your project to make sure the right files are scanned. This is only likely to be something you need to think about in complex monorepo-type setups, where you'll want to `cd` to the right folder in your scripts or use `npm run` with the `--prefix` option to explicitly set the CWD.\r\n- **Any gitignored paths are skipped** ‚Äî any files or folders matched by your `.gitignore` file will not be scanned for classes. This prevents giant dependency folders like `node_modules` from being scanned, as well as any directories where you are storing generated files (like compiled CSS or JS), which avoids infinite rebuild loops.\r\n- **All top-level folders are registered as content paths** ‚Äî we watch every top-level folder for changes as if you configured them yourself with globs like `./components/**/*.js` and `./pages/**/*.js`. This makes sure we notice any new files or folders you create and scan them without you needing to restart your build process.\r\n- **...except `./public`** ‚Äî we explicitly don't watch `./public/**/*.{whatever}` because it's common to store generated assets like compiled CSS and JS in the `./public` folder which can cause infinite rebuild loops, particularly in webpack where we can't actually register globs to watch and can only register directories. Instead, we explicitly watch each individual file in `./public` that could contain classes, like an `index.html` file for instance.\r\n- **Top-level files are watched individually** ‚Äî we can't watch `./**/*` because webpack doesn't support globs which means we'd end up watching `./node_modules`, so instead we watch every top-level file that might contain classes individually. This means creating a new top-level file currently requires restarting your build process. In practice though it's extremely rare to create new top-level files that contain classes.\r\n- **All binary file extensions are skipped** ‚Äî we don't scan files that obviously won't contain classes, like images, videos, zip files, etc.\r\n- **Stylesheet files are skipped** ‚Äî we don't look for classes in `css`, `scss`, `sass`, `less`, or `styl` files.\r\n- **Common generated files are skipped** ‚Äî we explicitly don't scan known generated files like `package-lock.json`.\r\n- **Tailwind configuration files are skipped** ‚Äî your `tailwind.config.js` file is never going to be a source of classes to include in the final CSS so we don't scan it.\r\n- **Classes are detected using a known list of file extensions** ‚Äî we automatically watch for a long list of common file types that could contain Tailwind classes, like `.js`, `.html`, `.php`, even `.json`. This way you don't need to restart your dev server the first time you create one of these files in an existing project.\r\n- **Additional template extensions are detected based on your specific project** ‚Äî when we scan your project for classes, we keep track of every file extension we see and add them to our master list of extensions to watch for your project. So if you are using some obscure templating language I've never heard of that uses the `*.potato` extension, we'll watch `*.potato` files in all folders as long as we see at least one `*.potato` file when the build process starts.\r\n\r\nIn our testing these heuristics work great, and we've been able to remove the `content` configuration from every one of our own projects that we've tried it in.\r\n\r\nIf for whatever reason these heuristics don't work properly for your project, you can explicitly configure `content` just like you were doing before, and Tailwind will respect that configuration and not try to do any automatic content detection at all. This way you always have the option of full control over which files are scanned for classes.\r\n\r\n## Known limitations\r\n\r\nHow things work currently isn't perfect, and there are a few known limitations you might run into depending on how your project is structured.\r\n\r\n- **Creating a new file with an unseen extension that isn't in our safelist requires restarting your build process** ‚Äî if your build process is already running and you try to create your very first `*.piledriver` file, Tailwind won't notice it and you'll need to restart your script.\r\n- **Running your build command from a different directory will scan the wrong paths** ‚Äî because we treat the current working directory as your project root, you need to run your build script from the right place or Tailwind will scan the wrong files. In practice you probably will never notice this ‚Äî you are already doing this if you use `npm run {command}` because that's how `npm run` already works.\r\n- **You can't force specific gitignored files to be scanned while automatically detecting every other file** ‚Äî if you have some specific files you need to scan that live in `node_modules` but you want to ignore everything else in `node_modules`, you currently need to opt-out of automatic content detection and go back to explicitly configuring your content paths.\r\n- **Creating a new top-level folder that includes files that need to be scanned requires restarting your build process** ‚Äî since we only watch top-level folders for new file events and not the entire project root, creating new top-level folders requires restarting your build process. A common example of where you might run into this is creating a `./components` folder for the first time in a Next.js project while your dev server is already running.\r\n- **The only way to explicitly prevent scanning a path is to gitignore it** ‚Äî you can't tell Tailwind not to scan a folder for classes without also gitignoring that folder. If you need more control, you need to opt-out of automatic content detection and configure `content` explicitly.\r\n\r\nDespite these limitations, we're still finding automatic content detection to be miles ahead of explicit content configuration in terms of developer experience, and for projects that are structured in a conventional way you pretty much don't ever see or feel these limitations at all.\r\n\r\n## Planned improvements\r\n\r\nWhile we're ready to start shipping support for this in our `oxide-insiders` builds as-is, we do have some improvements we plan to explore that will hopefully make the experience even better:\r\n\r\n- **Skipping gitignored folders within top-level folders** ‚Äî because of limitations with webpack's dependency tracking APIs our current implementation doesn't skip gitignored folders unless they are top-level. So if you have something like `./src/node_modules`, we still scan that folder. We should be able to solve this though, maybe even before we merge this PR.\r\n- **Support for scanning specific paths in addition to automatically detected paths** ‚Äî using something like a new `@source \"./node_modules/my-library/dist/**/*.js\"` directive in your CSS, we hope to make it possible to scan paths that live within ignored directories without opting out of automatic content detection. This will also make it possible to scan for classes in parent/sibling directories, which some people might need in certain monorepo setups.\r\n- **Configure content paths more intelligently based on the running build tool** ‚Äî not all build tools offer the same amount of control when it comes to registering paths we need to watch for changes, with webpack being the most limited. Currently we are solving for the lowest common denominator, but that's where limitations like \"can't notice newly created top-level folders\" come from. We can technically solve that in tools like Vite that offer more control, but to do that we need to detect the build tool you're using and intelligently register different dependency paths. We plan to explore this and see what we can come up with.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nReally excited about this one, I think it's the biggest step-function improvement to the developer experience in Tailwind since the JIT engine. Looking forward to getting everyone playing with it so we can refine our heuristics and get things feeling as rock-solid as possible.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/11173","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[Oxide] Automatic content detection\" (#11173)"},{"Id":"1692523664","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-07T01:23:53","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"11142","RawContent":null,"Title":"WIP: [oxide] Auto content","State":"closed","Body":"This PR adds a new auto content feature.\n\n<!-- Will improve this description once we finalize this PR a bit more with all the exact features. -->\n<!-- Dropping this message in here such that you know I didn't forget about this üòâ -->\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/11142","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"WIP: [oxide] Auto content\" (#11142)"},{"Id":"1698641945","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-06T14:00:45","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"11168","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update postcss-selector-parser: 6.0.11 ‚Üí 6.0.12 (patch)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

Since it prevents specific items from being selected, it is known as the negation pseudo-class.\r\n\r\n## Some of use cases\r\nI use it alot. But The most important use case i use it in form validation. like this:\r\n```<input <!-- ... --> class=\"[&:not(:placeholder-shown):invalid]:ring-pink-400\" />```. \r\nWhat does that mean? It blocks the input validition until input has a value.\r\n\r\nI walk around it by the example above but if `tailwindcss` has class for it `not:placeholder-shown:isvalid` will be well.</div>","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/11128","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Add :not() the negation pseudo-class.\" (#11128)"},{"Id":"1689221516","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-29T02:35:32","Actor":"ARiyou2000","Number":"11123","RawContent":null,"Title":"Next.JS/React.JS - Style not apply if using variable as class name outside of component file","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

This means a touch device with trackpad connected (eg. iPad with Magic Keyboard) doesn‚Äôt show any hovers when using the trackpad when this flag is enabled.\r\n\r\nUsing [any-hover](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/any-hover) and [any-pointer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/any-pointer) should solve that issue, however simply changing the value might not be the best option, as some people could want the current behaviour. There also might be some edge cases I‚Äôm not seeing right now ‚Äî likely some hybrid device which does some weird stuff in tablet vs laptop mode, etc. which could result in sticky hovers even with the flag enabled‚Ä¶\r\n\r\nA viable option might be to have control over which property is used, eg.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfuture: {\r\n  hoverOnlyWhenSupported: \"primary\" | \"any\" | false,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is reproducible in XCode Simulator (click the \"Capture pointer\" button in top right) using the play link above. Here‚Äôs also a great page which shows the difference between the selectors and shows you what media your device currently matches:\r\nhttps://patrickhlauke.github.io/touch/pointer-hover-any-pointer-any-hover/\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI tried to solve this locally by first disabling the `hover` core plugin and wasn‚Äôt able to:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ncorePlugins: {\r\n  hover: false,\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooks like it‚Äôs not even specified in `CorePluginList` type. But then I tried simply adding a new custom `hover` variant and it allows me to override the core plugin, css output looks üëå too ‚Äî https://play.tailwindcss.com/TT1IC2V7xN\r\n\r\nSeems like this could be a viable short term solution for me, but it just doesn‚Äôt feel right‚Ä¶\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nplugins: [\r\n  function ({ addVariant }) {\r\n    addVariant('hover', '@media (any-hover: hover) and (any-pointer: fine) { &:hover }')\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/11109","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`hoverOnlyWhenSupported` doesn‚Äôt work with iPad trackpad\" (#11109)"},{"Id":"1685839392","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-27T09:41:24","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"11104","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update lightningcss: 1.18.0 ‚Üí 1.20.0 (minor)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

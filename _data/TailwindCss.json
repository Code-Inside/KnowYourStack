We recently upgraded to v2.2 from v2.1 (yes, we're very behind... ðŸ˜…) and encountered this issue that is also present in the latest release.\r\n\r\nAt least in v2.2.19 and v3.4.1 the `animation-name` property is being incorrectly parsed, resulting in the matching `keyframes` being excluded from the CSS output.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be parseAnimationValue, which is confusing a `var(...)` for the animation name. Then the JIT presumably excludes the \"unused\" keyframes.\r\n\r\nIt's straightforward to verify that that the output is incorrect (this is v2.2, but the same is true for v3):\r\n\r\n```\r\nnode -p \"require('tailwindcss/lib/util/parseAnimationValue').default('slide-x var(--slide-duration) linear 0s 1 forwards')\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1052\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/90831/d8eeff41-e366-46a8-8407-0eaf7be0123e\">\r\n\r\n(`name` is incorrect)\r\n\r\nNote that a real browser / CSS parser has no trouble discerning which of the values is actually the name, as shown by this JSFiddle! https://jsfiddle.net/kirbysayshi/6nkpe8yw/\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to put the animation name last, but this goes against the guidelines from MDN (which I'm sure everyone's aware of, given some comments I see in parseAnimationValue tests!):\r\n\r\n> If a value in the animation shorthand can be parsed as a value for an animation property other than animation-name, then the value will be applied to that property first and not to animation-name. For this reason, the recommended practice is to specify a value for animation-name as _the last value in a list of values_ when using the animation shorthand; \r\n\r\n(emphasis mine) from : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation#description\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\n- https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/4737\r\n- https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/5602\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13208","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"animation property using `var()` has the wrong name, keyframes are excluded and animation is broken\" (#13208)"},{"Id":"2177723711","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-11T20:58:56","Actor":"coolemur","Number":"13185","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] pseudo element content is applied on hover when it shouldn't ","State":"closed","Body":"https://play.tailwindcss.com/GdvdL0CtyR\r\n\r\nIn v3 this doesn't have after:content when hovered\r\nIn v4 this does have after:content when hovered\r\n\r\n<img width=\"369\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 14 34 27\" src=\"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/29693103/359bc38e-ea8c-4a22-b754-287f230fc875\">\r\n\r\nAnd this element doesn't even have something like `after:content-['']` applied at all, so after pseudo element isn't expected to be visible at all.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13185","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[v4] pseudo element content is applied on hover when it shouldn't \" (#13185)"},{"Id":"2179808148","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-11T19:31:47","Actor":"antonijo01","Number":"13202","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unknown at rule @theme in style.css","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\nv4-alpha\r\n\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\n\r\nVSCode\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\nNode v21.0.0.\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\n\r\nChrome\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\n\r\nlocalhost\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nAfter installing via CLI, I tried to add @theme to style.css and got an error.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/107608985/f9cbc3d4-b14d-4a6e-8f85-3da5163d9de0)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13202","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Unknown at rule @theme in style.css\" (#13202)"},{"Id":"2179997243","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-11T19:10:22","Actor":"adamwathan","Number":"13203","RawContent":null,"Title":"Prepare alpha.8 release","State":"closed","Body":"Updates versions and changelog for alpha.8 release.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/13203","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Prepare alpha.8 release\" (#13203)"},{"Id":"2177817512","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-11T18:17:19","Actor":"adamwathan","Number":"13189","RawContent":null,"Title":"Reset borders, padding, and margin universally","State":"closed","Body":"Noticed iframes have a default border we weren't resetting, feels safest to just remove borders across the board and reintroduce them for form controls.\r\n\r\nWe were also resetting padding on an element by element basis but I can't think of any elements we are actually trying to avoid resetting padding on, so just reset it everywhere.\r\n\r\nThis also removes the left margin on file buttons that separates the button from the meta data about the currently selected file but I think this is fine, let the user decide how much space to put there intentionally like we do with other things.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/13189","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Reset borders, padding, and margin universally\" (#13189)"},{"Id":"2177738051","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-11T18:09:50","Actor":"adamwathan","Number":"13187","RawContent":null,"Title":"Prevent `content-none` from being overridden when conditionally styling `::before`/`::after`","State":"closed","Body":"Prior to this PR, `content-none` wasn't setting the `--tw-content` variable which meant that utilities like `after:underline` or similar would reset `content` back to `var(--tw-content)`.

If CSS files are created that include `@tailwind` and later deleted, remove them from the list of files checked. This could theoretically happen if some process created CSS files with `@tailwind` with different names on each build. \r\n\r\nThanks to @timneutkens for highlighting this issue.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/13197","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Vite plugin: stop checking CSS files that no longer exist\" (#13197)"},{"Id":"2179485120","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-11T16:34:01","Actor":"n0ah01","Number":"13198","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] Gradients not working in Firefox","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\ntailwindcss v4.0.0-alpha.7\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\n@tailwindcss/cli@4.0.0-alpha.7\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\nnode v21.6.2\r\nnpm 10.2.4\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\n\r\nFirefox: 123.0.1\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\n\r\nUbuntu 22.04.4 LTS\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\n\r\n[https://play.tailwindcss.com/1E6nLOSBdR](https://play.tailwindcss.com/1E6nLOSBdR)\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"grid gap-2\">\r\n\t<div class=\"rounded h-16 border-solid border-slate-500 border bg-gradient-to-r from-cyan-500 to-blue-500\"></div>\r\n\t<div class=\"rounded h-16 border-solid border-slate-500 border bg-gradient-to-r [--tw-gradient-stops:#f00,#0f0]\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nCreating a normal gradient with default Tailwind classes like `bg-gradient-to-r from-cyan-500 to-blue-500` does not produce working CSS for Firefox, works normali in Brave/Chrome.

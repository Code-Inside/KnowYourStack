However, the `color-mix(…)` polyfill has since then made changes to the declaration so it can't find it's position correctly anymore and will thus instead delete the last declaration of the node (this caused unrelated CSS variables to be eliminated while the ones with `color-mix(…)` were unexpectedly kept).\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we decided to apply the polyfills after any eventual deletions. This also ensures that no `@supports` query for the variables are created and simplifies the code a bit since all polyfills are now colocated.\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\n- Added a unit test for the example we discovered in #17553\r\n- Luckily the conditions of this seemed rare enough so that it doesn't cause any other of our tests to update.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17555","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix  polyfill in combination with unused CSS variable removal\" (#17555)"},{"Id":"2972004782","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-04T12:58:50","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"17554","RawContent":null,"Title":"PostCSS: Fix Turbopack 'one-revision-behind' bug","State":"closed","Body":"Closes #17508\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes another issue we found that caused dev builds with Next.js and Turbopack to resolve the CSS file that was saved one revision before the latest update.\r\n\r\nWhen debugging this we noticed that the PostCSS entry is called twice for every one update when changing the input CSS file directly. That was caused by the input file itself being added as a _dependency_ so you would first get the callback that a _dependency_ has updated (at which point we look at the file system and figure out we need a full-rebuild because the input.css file has changed) and then another callback for when the _input file_ has updated. The problem with the second callback was that the file-system was already scanned for updates and since this includes the `mtimes` for the input file, we seemingly thought that the input file did not change. However, the issue is that the first callback actually came with an outdated PostCSS input AST...\r\n\r\nWe found that this problem arises when you register the input CSS as a dependency of itself. This is not expected and we actually guard against this in the PostCSS client. However, we found that the input `from` argument is _a relative path when using Next.js with Turbopack_ so that check was not working as expected. \r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\nAdded the change to the repro from #17508 and it seems to work fine now.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2acb0078-f961-4498-be1a-b1c72d5ceda1\r\n\r\nAlso added a unit test to ensure we document that the input file path can be a relative path.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17554","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"PostCSS: Fix Turbopack 'one-revision-behind' bug\" (#17554)"},{"Id":"2971920023","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-04T12:45:56","Actor":"Jordan-Hall","Number":"17551","RawContent":null,"Title":"RSLib with postcss tailwind adding a space on emitted css when calling tailwind function  `theme(spacing.

Clone the reproduction repository: `git clone https://github.com/geomaster/vite-tailwind-v4-svg-delete-repro`\n2.  Install dependencies: `pnpm install`\n3.  Start the Vite dev server: `pnpm dev`\n4.  In **another terminal**, run the following command while the dev server is running:\n    ```bash\n    sed -i '/import iconUrl from/d' src/App.tsx && sed -i '/<img src={iconUrl}/d' src/App.tsx && rm src/assets/icon.svg && echo \"Triggered bug sequence.\"\n    ```\n    *(This removes the JS import, the usage in JSX, and then deletes the SVG file)*\n5.  Observe the terminal running `pnpm dev`.\n\n**Observed Behavior:**\n\nThe Vite dev server crashes with an `ENOENT: no such file or directory` error trying to open the deleted SVG file. The error trace points to the `vite:css-analysis` plugin and mentions the `src/index.css` file, even though `src/index.css` does not directly reference the SVG via `url()`:\n\n```\n[plugin:vite:css-analysis] ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/home/geomaster/Projects/test/vite-tailwind4-asset-delete-repro/src/assets/icon.svg'\n\n/home/geomaster/Projects/test/vite-tailwind4-asset-delete-repro/src/index.css\n\n    at async open (node:internal/fs/promises:638:25)\n    at async Object.readFile (node:internal/fs/promises:1242:14)\n    at async fileToDevUrl (file:///home/geomaster/Projects/test/vite-tailwind4-asset-delete-repro/node_modules/.pnpm/vite@6.2.5_jiti@2.4.2_lightningcss@1.29.2/node_modules/vite/dist/node/chunks/dep-Pj_jxEzN.js:13597:21)\n    at async TransformPluginContext.transform (file:///home/geomaster/Projects/test/vite-tailwind4-asset-delete-repro/node_modules/.pnpm/vite@6.2.5_jiti@2.4.2_lightningcss@1.29.2/node_modules/vite/dist/node/chunks/dep-Pj_jxEzN.js:48876:27)\n    at async EnvironmentPluginContainer.transform (file:///home/geomaster/Projects/test/vite-tailwind4-asset-delete-repro/node_modules/.pnpm/vite@6.2.5_jiti@2.4.2_lightningcss@1.29.2/node_modules/vite/dist/node/chunks/dep-Pj_jxEzN.js:47680:18)\n    at async loadAndTransform (file:///home/geomaster/Projects/test/vite-tailwind4-asset-delete-repro/node_modules/.pnpm/vite@6.2.5_jiti@2.4.2_lightningcss@1.29.2/node_modules/vite/dist/node/chunks/dep-Pj_jxEzN.js:41327:27)\n    at async viteTransformMiddleware (file:///home/geomaster/Projects/test/vite-tailwind4-asset-delete-repro/node_modules/.pnpm/vite@6.2.5_jiti@2.4.2_lightningcss@1.29.2/node_modules/vite/dist/node/chunks/dep-Pj_jxEzN.js:42807:24\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n\nThe Vite dev server should handle the file deletion gracefully via HMR without crashing. The component using the deleted asset should update (likely showing an error or missing image in the browser), but the server itself should remain running.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   This crash **does not** occur if the `@import \"tailwindcss\";` line is removed from `src/index.css`.\n*   This crash **does not** occur when using Tailwind CSS v3 (with `@tailwind` directives and the PostCSS plugin setup) under the same conditions.\n*   The issue seems independent of how the SVG is imported (tested with standard `?url` import here, originally found with `vite-plugin-svgr`).","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17532","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Deleting an SVG asset causes a Vite HMR crash while processing `@import \"tailwindcss\"`\" (#17532)"},{"Id":"2969951317","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-03T15:36:42","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"17530","RawContent":null,"Title":"Prepare release v4.1.2","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17530","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Prepare release v4.1.2\" (#17530)"},{"Id":"2969949000","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-03T15:24:27","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"17529","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix test that relies on mtimes","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes a timing issue added to a new unit test on `main`.

However, `lg:` media query prefixed styles work as expected when the screen size meets or exceeds the `lg` breakpoint. This issue does not occur in Firefox or Safari, where base styles are applied correctly on smaller screens.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n\n1.  Create an Astro component or page with the following code (replace `property` and `value` with your specific Tailwind utility classes):\n\n    ```html\n    <div class=\"property-value md:property-value-md lg:property-value-lg\"></div>\n    ```\n\n    For example, using background color:\n    ```html\n    <div class=\"bg-black md:bg-white lg:bg-black\"></div>\n    ```\n    Or using text color:\n    ```html\n    <div class=\"text-red-500 md:text-blue-500 lg:text-green-500\"></div>\n    ```\n\n2.  Run the Astro development server.\n3.  Open the page in Google Chrome or Arc browser.\n4.  Observe that the `md:property-value-md` style is applied, even when the browser window is smaller than the `md` breakpoint (768px by default).\n5.  Resize the browser window to be larger than the `lg` breakpoint (1024px by default).\n6.  Observe that the `lg:property-value-lg` style is correctly applied.\n7.  Open the same page in Firefox or Safari.\n8.  Observe that the `property-value` style is applied on smaller screens and `md:property-value-md` on medium screens and larger, as expected.\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n\nThe base styles (without media query prefixes) should apply on all screen sizes below the `md` breakpoint in all browsers.\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\n\nIn Chrome and Arc, the `md:` media query prefixed styles override the base styles even on smaller screens.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17517","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Tailwind CSS (@tailwindcss/vite) Base Styles Incorrectly Overridden by `md:` Media Queries in Chrome/Arc, but not Firefox/Safari\" (#17517)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-04-06T03:30:20.9872507Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":585}

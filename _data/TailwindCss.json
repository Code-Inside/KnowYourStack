When I updated tailwind, the css was no longer being applied to the html nor was even being sent to the client. When downgrading to version 3.1.8, it works as intended. This lack of css occurs in development as well as in production builds of nextjs. I have tested this in other projects, and get this bug in the repo provided above. \r\n\r\nSteps to Reproduce (more info given in github repo provided): \r\n1. Create next app\r\n2. Add dependencies:  yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer\r\n3.  Generate tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js :  npx tailwindcss init -p\r\n4. Configured paths in tailwind config\r\n5.  Add typography plugin:  yarn add -D @tailwindcss/typography\r\n6. Add typography plugin to config\r\n7. Add the Tailwind directives to CSS\r\n8.Start the dev server: yarn dev\r\n9. At this point no css is loading\r\n10. Remove .next folder to ensure no cross contamination when testing other version of tailwind\r\n11.  Change tailwind version:  yarn add -D tailwindcss@3.1.8\r\n12.  Start the dev server and see css:  yarn dev\r\n\r\n**Tailwind version 3.2.1**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1626\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-24 at 10 20 24\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58585071/197487809-54c98220-e05e-404a-bf75-1ac3413a691c.png\">\r\n\r\n**Tailwind version 3.1.8**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1071\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-24 at 10 20 56\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58585071/197487788-76736049-8053-48f6-ac9d-59aa25b3f5ac.png\">\r\n\r\n**Also discussed in Tailwind discord**\r\nhttps://discord.com/channels/486935104384532500/1033999336499060746\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/9649","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Tailwindcss 3.2.1 Not working with Nextjs\" (#9649)"},{"Id":"1420714031","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-10-24T12:06:39","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"9650","RawContent":null,"Title":"Escape special characters in resolved content base path","State":"closed","Body":"We use `fast-glob` internally and it treats a handful of characters as special.

This becomes a problem because JITI uses a version of require that we were not patching to load the built in plugins.\r\n\r\nMaking this work is a bit more complicated than it seems at first glance and relies on an internal implementation detail of JITI.

The root of our comedy of errors? Our custom responsive utility classes, which apparently have a sense of humor too, especially the negative ones. Several coffee cups and a few hours of head-scratching later, I stumbled upon the culprit.\r\n\r\nIt appears that TailwindCSS struggles with utility classes that begin with a \"-\" (minus sign) when combined with pseudo-class modifiers. While I understand that our use of responsive utilities may not align perfectly with TailwindCSS's intended use, this issue seems to be more broadly related to any custom utility class starting with a \"-\" throwing the error: \"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'raws')\".\r\n\r\n_Whilst digging around in the source code I managed to create a quick fix. It seems that the variants / screenNodes extracted from the context.stylesheetCache generate an undefined PostCSS Node. (I really tried to understand all of this and how it comes to be - but it just got too complicated at this point to debug it ^^ - hope it helps tho)_\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// lib/expandTailwindAtRules.js\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n    // We do post-filtering to not alter the emitted order of the variants\r\n    const variantNodes = Array.from(screenNodes).filter((node) => {\r\n      if (typeof node === 'undefined') return false // <- this line \"fixes\" it\r\n\r\n      const parentLayer = node.raws.tailwind?.parentLayer\r\n\r\n      if (parentLayer === 'components') {\r\n        return layerNodes.components !== null\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      if (parentLayer === 'utilities') {\r\n        return layerNodes.utilities !== null\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      return true\r\n    })\r\n\r\n...","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/12435","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Custom Utility Classes beginning with \"-\" break TailwindCSS when used in Pseudo Modifiers/Elements\" (#12435)"},{"Id":"2018934053","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-01T15:22:45","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"12514","RawContent":null,"Title":"Don't crash when given applying a variant to a negated version of a simple utility","State":"closed","Body":"Given a simple utility like the following:\r\n```\r\naddUtilities({\r\n  '.top-lg': {\r\n    top: '6rem',\r\n  },\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we encountered `hover:-top-lg` we didn't handle candidate elimination properly and an `undefined` utility snuck in causing a crash.

The example shows the correct output.\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nI have a React element with the content of the reproduction URL. When I try to render the line `before:[content:'\\00a0\\00a0\\00a0']` I get the React error: `  × Legacy octal escape is not permitted in strict mode`\r\n\r\nTherefore, I change the line into `before:[content:'\\\\00a0\\\\00a0\\\\00a0']`, which renders the line as `before:[content:'\\00a0\\00a0\\00a0']` but the TailwindCSS parser does not seem to catch the escape and does not create the appropriate class name to render the spaces.\r\n\r\nMaybe there is a hack which I'm not aware about, sorry if that is the case. Otherwise it would be great if this issue could be solved.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/12476","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Before content with space cannot be parsed within React system\" (#12476)"},{"Id":"2015417024","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-29T13:39:34","Actor":"v-kryvenda","Number":"12495","RawContent":null,"Title":"Doesnt work with CRA, or CRA + Craco","State":"closed","Body":"I upload archive with example.\r\n[front-end.zip](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/files/13493901/front-end.zip)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/12495","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Doesnt work with CRA, or CRA + Craco\" (#12495)"},{"Id":"2013435131","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-28T01:54:01","Actor":"eduardvercaemer","Number":"12493","RawContent":null,"Title":"`not-prose` does not revert `prose` max-width setting","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\n3.3.3\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\nvite: 4.4.11\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\nv21.2.0\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\n\r\nTested on Chrome / Firefox Nightly\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\n\r\nLinux\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\n\r\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/daisyui-qwik-n2xlvc?file=src%2Froutes%2Findex.tsx\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nWhen using `not-prose` to override the prose behaviour on some styled component, I expect it to retain its max-width behaviour, but it still gets an inherited max-width property from prose:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/40474768/3d4b0e7d-a8a9-4aae-adc1-87c54ff2303d)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/12493","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"`not-prose` does not revert `prose` max-width setting\" (#12493)"},{"Id":"2009922800","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-27T14:12:58","Actor":"datlechin","Number":"12480","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add logical properties support for float and clear","State":"closed","Body":"This update introduces support for logical properties related to floating and clearing elements in TailwindCSS.

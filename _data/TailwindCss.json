With this release, esbuild's serve mode will also respond to HTTP <code class=\"notranslate\">HEAD</code> requests, which are just like HTTP <code class=\"notranslate\">GET</code> requests except that the body of the response is omitted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Permit top-level await in dead code branches (<a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2853\">#2853</a>)</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Adding top-level await to a file has a few consequences with esbuild:</p>\n<ol dir=\"auto\">\n<li>It causes esbuild to assume that the input module format is ESM, since top-level await is only syntactically valid in ESM. That prevents you from using <code class=\"notranslate\">module</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">exports</code> for exports and also enables strict mode, which disables certain syntax and changes how function hoisting works (among other things).</li>\n<li>This will cause esbuild to fail the build if either top-level await isn't supported by your language target (e.g. it's not supported in ES2021) or if top-level await isn't supported by the chosen output format (e.g. it's not supported with CommonJS).</li>\n<li>Doing this will prevent you from using <code class=\"notranslate\">require()</code> on this file or on any file that imports this file (even indirectly), since the <code class=\"notranslate\">require()</code> function doesn't return a promise and so can't represent top-level await.</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This release relaxes these rules slightly: rules 2 and 3 will now no longer apply when esbuild has identified the code branch as dead code, such as when it's behind an <code class=\"notranslate\">if (false)</code> check. This should make it possible to use esbuild to convert code into different output formats that only uses top-level await conditionally. This release does not relax rule 1. Top-level await will still cause esbuild to unconditionally consider the input module format to be ESM, even when the top-level <code class=\"notranslate\">await</code> is in a dead code branch. This is necessary because whether the input format is ESM or not affects the whole file, not just the dead code branch.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Fix entry points where the entire file name is the extension (<a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2861\">#2861</a>)</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Previously if you passed esbuild an entry point where the file extension is the entire file name, esbuild would use the parent directory name to derive the name of the output file. For example, if you passed esbuild a file <code class=\"notranslate\">./src/.ts</code> then the output name would be <code class=\"notranslate\">src.js</code>. This bug happened because esbuild first strips the file extension to get <code class=\"notranslate\">./src/</code> and then joins the path with the working directory to get the absolute path (e.g. <code class=\"notranslate\">join(\"/working/dir\", \"./src/\")</code> gives <code class=\"notranslate\">/working/dir/src</code>). However, the join operation also canonicalizes the path which strips the trailing <code class=\"notranslate\">/</code>. Later esbuild uses the \"base name\" operation to extract the name of the output file. Since there is no trailing <code class=\"notranslate\">/</code>, esbuild returns <code class=\"notranslate\">\"src\"</code> as the base name instead of <code class=\"notranslate\">\"\"</code>, which causes esbuild to incorrectly include the directory name in the output file name. This release fixes this bug by deferring the stripping of the file extension until after all path manipulations have been completed. So now the file <code class=\"notranslate\">./src/.ts</code> will generate an output file named <code class=\"notranslate\">.js</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Support replacing property access expressions with inject</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">At a high level, this change means the <code class=\"notranslate\">inject</code> feature can now replace all of the same kinds of names as the <code class=\"notranslate\">define</code> feature. So <code class=\"notranslate\">inject</code> is basically now a more powerful version of <code class=\"notranslate\">define</code>, instead of previously only being able to do some of the things that <code class=\"notranslate\">define</code> could do.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Soem background is necessary to understand this change if you aren't already familiar with the <code class=\"notranslate\">inject</code> feature. The <code class=\"notranslate\">inject</code> feature lets you replace references to global variable with a shim. It works like this:</p>\n<ol dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Put the shim in its own file</li>\n<li>Export the shim as the name of the global variable you intend to replace</li>\n<li>Pass the file to esbuild using the <code class=\"notranslate\">inject</code> feature</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"auto\">For example, if you inject the following file using <code class=\"notranslate\">--inject:./injected.js</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-js\" dir=\"auto\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><span class=\"pl-c\">// injected.js</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">let</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">processShim</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span> <span class=\"pl-en\">cwd</span>: <span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"pl-s\">'/'</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">export</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">processShim</span> <span class=\"pl-k\">as</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">process</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span></pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Then esbuild will replace all references to <code class=\"notranslate\">process</code> with the <code class=\"notranslate\">processShim</code> variable, which will cause <code class=\"notranslate\">process.cwd()</code> to return <code class=\"notranslate\">'/'</code>. This feature is sort of abusing the ESM export alias syntax to specify the mapping of global variables to shims. But esbuild works this way because using this syntax for that purpose is convenient and terse.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">However, if you wanted to replace a property access expression, the process was more complicated and not as nice. You would have to:</p>\n<ol dir=\"auto\">\n<li>Put the shim in its own file</li>\n<li>Export the shim as some random name</li>\n<li>Pass the file to esbuild using the <code class=\"notranslate\">inject</code> feature</li>\n<li>Use esbuild's <code class=\"notranslate\">define</code> feature to map the property access expression to the random name you made in step 2</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"auto\">For example, if you inject the following file using <code class=\"notranslate\">--inject:./injected2.js --define:process.cwd=someRandomName</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-js\" dir=\"auto\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><span class=\"pl-c\">// injected2.js</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">let</span> <span class=\"pl-en\">cwdShim</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"pl-s\">'/'</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">export</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span> <span class=\"pl-en\">cwdShim</span> <span class=\"pl-k\">as</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">someRandomName</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span></pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Then esbuild will replace all references to <code class=\"notranslate\">process.cwd</code> with the <code class=\"notranslate\">cwdShim</code> variable, which will also cause <code class=\"notranslate\">process.cwd()</code> to return <code class=\"notranslate\">'/'</code> (but which this time will not mess with other references to <code class=\"notranslate\">process</code>, which might be desirable).</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">With this release, using the inject feature to replace a property access expression is now as simple as using it to replace an identifier. You can now use JavaScript's <a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/2154\">\"arbitrary module namespace identifier names\"</a> feature to specify the property access expression directly using a string literal. For example, if you inject the following file using <code class=\"notranslate\">--inject:./injected3.js</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-js\" dir=\"auto\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><span class=\"pl-c\">// injected3.js</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">let</span> <span class=\"pl-en\">cwdShim</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">(</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">)</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"pl-s\">'/'</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">export</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">{</span> <span class=\"pl-en\">cwdShim</span> <span class=\"pl-k\">as</span> <span class=\"pl-s\">'process.cwd'</span> <span class=\"pl-kos\">}</span></pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Then esbuild will now replace all references to <code class=\"notranslate\">process.cwd</code> with the <code class=\"notranslate\">cwdShim</code> variable, which will also cause <code class=\"notranslate\">process.cwd()</code> to return <code class=\"notranslate\">'/'</code> (but which will also not mess with other references to <code class=\"notranslate\">process</code>).</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">In addition to inserting a shim for a global variable that doesn't exist, another use case is replacing references to static methods on global objects with cached versions to both minify them better and to make access to them potentially faster. For example:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-js\" dir=\"auto\"><pre class=\"notranslate\"><span class=\"pl-c\">// Injected file</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">let</span> <span class=\"pl-s1\">cachedMin</span> <span class=\"pl-c1\">=</span> <span class=\"pl-v\">Math</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">.</span><span class=\"pl-c1\">min</span>\n<span class=\"pl-k\">let</span> <span

I would expect to see a convention like; *\"Only alphanumeric group labels supported.\"*. Since the use case mentioned in the original issue [misunderstood the way how Tailwind works](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/10266#issuecomment-1374513943), I would expect this issue to be fixed by just fixing the compiler error rather than generating a *\"false positive\"*(?) I guess.\r\n\r\nAlso, it seems #10276 trying to __balance brackets__. In my opinion, balanced shouldn't be a must. For example, the following code is should be totally valid and generate corresponding classes if special characters are allowed in group labels, but it doesn't.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"group/{id foo\">\r\n  <div class=\"group-[.foo]/{id:bg-gray-300\">group-[.foo]/{id:bg-gray-300</div>\r\n  <!--                        ^ second bracket is removed -->\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/10402","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"can't use arbitrary group selectors with group labels that contains `$` character\" (#10402)"},{"Id":"1553369531","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-23T18:37:42","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"10400","RawContent":null,"Title":"Handle group/peer variants with quoted strings","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #10353\r\n\r\nThis fixes two issues:\r\n1.

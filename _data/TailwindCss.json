However, I've encountered an issue when using `next-pwa`—or more specifically, service workers—along with the new Tailwind setup.  \n\nWhen I export my Next.js configuration with `next-pwa`, it results in an infinite compilation loop, as shown below:  \n\n```\n✓ Compiled in 613ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 210ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 224ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 225ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 213ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 240ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 215ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 212ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 212ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 205ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 206ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 210ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 205ms (1705 modules)  \n✓ Compiled in 206ms (1705 modules)  \n...\n... and so on.\n```  \n\nHowever, if I export my Next.js config **without** `next-pwa` and do not register any service worker, everything works fine.  \n\nI dug deeper into this issue and found that when the service worker is enabled, removing the `global.css` file (which contains all the new Tailwind `@theme` directives and imports) from the root layout eliminates the problem. This suggests that there might be a conflict between service workers and the Tailwind PostCSS plugin when used together.  \n\n**Additional Notes:**  \n- I have tested this scenario with both `next-pwa` and `@serwist`, and the issue does not seem to be related to the tool used for generating the service worker.  \n\nAny insights or potential fixes would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16763","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Infinite Compile Loop When Using `next-pwa` (service worker) with TailwindCSS v4\" (#16763)"},{"Id":"2873140165","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-23T11:59:10","Actor":"Sourav9063","Number":"16760","RawContent":null,"Title":"With Tailwind v4 HMR not working in server in NuxtJs","State":"open","Body":"[issue](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/issues/31096)\n\n### Environment\n\n```\n- Operating System: `Linux`\n- Node Version:     `v22.14.0`\n- Nuxt Version:     `3.15.4`\n- CLI Version:      `3.22.2`\n- Nitro Version:    `2.10.4`\n- Package Manager:  `yarn@1.22.22`\n- Builder:          `-`\n- User Config:      `compatibilityDate`, `devtools`, `css`, `vite`\n- Runtime Modules:  `-`\n- Build Modules:    `-`\n```\n\n### Reproduction\n\n Follow the official tailwind guide [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/nuxt](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/nuxt) \n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/github-dye83azh?file=server%2Fapi%2Fhealth.js\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nWhile following this guide tailwind official guide [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/nuxt](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/nuxt)  setting up nuxt project, the client side work fine.

(But not relevant.)\n- tailwind has been set up per instructions for ViteJS and main.css file has been included in the index.html file.\n- I modified the theme with custom background images.\n- Started a layout component for the tanstack root.\n- Started a menu component the default layout component with a `module.css` file.\n- I throw `@apply gap-2 p-2` from the default template into the primary class in the `PrimaryMenu.module.css` file and it errors.\n\nDebugging steps:\n- Verified that main.css file is included in the index.html file.\n- Tried excluding `.git` from my `.gitignore` file as recommend in #16669. This did not solve the issue.  \n- Tried hoisting node_modules and direct `@source` directives in the main.css file according to #16038.\n- Tried `@import 'tailwindcss';` in the `module.css` file. While this did load the general tailwind css set, it did not load a custom theme override.\n- Tried `@import 'tailwindcss' source('<path to src directory>');` in the `module.css` file. This did not work with the custom theme override.\n- Finally, `@import '../../../main.css';` solved the issue.\n\nI figured I'd make a separate issue because there didn't seem to be overlap.\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16728","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[bug] TW4 breaks module.css files\" (#16728)"},{"Id":"2870018961","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-21T21:13:22","Actor":"snaptopixel","Number":"16729","RawContent":null,"Title":"[bug] box-shadow doesn't work in shadow-dom due to reliance on @property","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

In non-shadow this is a non-issue since `@property` provides default values. However in shadow-dom `@property` does nothing, so ironically, in shadow-dom you will have no shadows on your dom.\n\nEssentially it seems there should be suitable fallbacks for any utils that currently rely on `@property` since it doesn't work in shadow-dom land.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16729","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[bug] box-shadow doesn't work in shadow-dom due to reliance on @property\" (#16729)"},{"Id":"2869841685","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-21T20:06:10","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"16726","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update eslint 9.19.0 → 9.20.1 (minor)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

The property sort order is defined in a list we maintain.\r\n\r\nWe also have to make sure that the property count is taken into account such that if all the \"sorts\" are the same, that we fallback to the property count. Most amount of properties should be first such that we can override it with more specific utilities that have fewer properties.\r\n\r\nHowever, if a property doesn't exist, then it wouldn't be included in a list of properties therefore the total count was off. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that by counting all the used properties. If a property already exists it is counted twice. E.g.:\r\n```css\r\n.foo {\r\n  color: red;\r\n\r\n  &:hover {\r\n    color: blue;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, we have 2 properties, not 1 even though it's the same `color` property.\r\n\r\n## Test plan:\r\n\r\n1. Updated the tests that are now sorted correctly\r\n2. Added an integration test to make sure that `prose-invert` is defined after the `prose-stone` classes when using the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin where this problem originated from.\r\n\r\nNote how in this play (https://play.tailwindcss.com/wt3LYDaljN) the `prose-invert` comes _before_ the `prose-stone` which means that you can't apply the `prose-invert` classes to invert `prose-stone`.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/16715","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Use amount of properties when sorting\" (#16715)"},{"Id":"2868121847","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-21T09:12:30","Actor":"djlguzman","Number":"16707","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] custom utility class gets overridden by default utility class","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

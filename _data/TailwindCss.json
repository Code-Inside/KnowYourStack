The first assigns the class HTML attribute directly, while the latter two set the attribute to a JavaScript string. Since [JavaScript designates the backslash as an escape character](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#using_special_characters_in_strings), the double backslash is necessary for the correct output.\n\n```jsx\n<div className=\"after:content-['\\a0_·_']\"/>{/* class=\"after:content-['\\a0_·_']\" */}\n<div className={\"after:content-['\\a0_·_']\"}/>{/* class=\"after:content-['a0_·_']\" */}\n<div className={\"after:content-['\\\\a0_·_']\"}/>{/* class=\"after:content-['\\a0_·_']\" */}\n```\n\nHence, only the first and third options provide the correct output. However, the third option does not produce the correct generated CSS. Note the different CSS selector and the different `--tw-content` variable.\n\n```css\n/* Output of Option 1 */\n@layer utilities {\n  .after\\:content-\\[\\'\\\\a0_·_\\'\\] {\n    &::after {\n      --tw-content: '\\a0 · ';\n      content: var(--tw-content);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n/* Output of Option 3 */\n@layer utilities {\n  .after\\:content-\\[\\'\\\\\\\\a0_·_\\'\\] {\n    &::after {\n      --tw-content: '\\\\a0 · ';\n      content: var(--tw-content);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis issue only exists in regards to the generated CSS. If the following code is executed, the styling works as intended, though generating both CSS outputs.\n\n```jsx\n{/* <div className=\"after:content-['\\a0_·_']\" /> */}\n<div className={\"after:content-['\\\\a0_·_']\"}>Bullet point</div>\n```\n\nThe [reproduction](https://github.com/jeremy-code/tailwindcss-escape-character-css-generation-bug) uses React, Vite, and the Vite Tailwind CSS plugin, but I've found this same issue also exists as of Next 16.1.4 and React 19.2.3.\n\nWhile the last two options are a bit silly in this minimal reproduction, the issue also applies when using a JavaScript function like `classnames`, `twMerge`, `clsx`, etc.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/19589","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Tailwind CSS generates incorrect CSS for escaped characters of JavaScript strings in React `className`\" (#19589)"},{"Id":"3840324365","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-21T22:52:27","Actor":"khasinski","Number":"19588","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix: handle invalid UTF-8 in Ruby and Vue preprocessors","State":"open","Body":"## Summary\n\nThis PR fixes a panic that occurs when the Ruby or Vue preprocessors encounter files with invalid UTF-8 bytes.\n\n**The issue:**\n- `ruby.rs:37` and `vue.rs:18` used `std::str::from_utf8(content).unwrap()` \n- This panics when processing files containing invalid UTF-8 bytes\n\n**Error message:**\n```\nthread panicked at crates/oxide/src/extractor/pre_processors/ruby.rs:37:59:\ncalled `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Utf8Error { valid_up_to: 45, error_len: Some(1) }\n```\n\n**The fix:**\n- Wrap UTF-8 conversion in `if let Ok(...)` to gracefully handle invalid UTF-8\n- Skip regex-based template extraction when UTF-8 conversion fails\n- Allow byte-level processing to continue (in Ruby's case)\n\nThis can happen in Rails projects when:\n- Binary files are inadvertently scanned\n- Files contain non-UTF-8 encodings  \n- Files are truncated at multi-byte character boundaries during parallel processing\n\n## Test plan\n\n- [x] Added `test_invalid_utf8_does_not_panic` test for Ruby preprocessor\n- [x] Added `test_valid_utf8_with_multibyte_chars` test for Ruby preprocessor\n- [x] Added `test_invalid_utf8_does_not_panic` test for Vue preprocessor\n- [x] All existing tests pass (`cargo test pre_processors` - 43 tests)","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/19588","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"fix: handle invalid UTF-8 in Ruby and Vue preprocessors\" (#19588)"},{"Id":"3839106512","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-21T16:43:27","Actor":"KashviYadav09","Number":"19587","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix utility generaFix utility generation for escaped theme keystion for escaped theme keys","State":"open","Body":"### Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where utilities are not generated when theme keys contain escaped special characters (e.g. `brand\\:primary`).\r\n\r\nTailwind allows escaped characters in theme configuration keys, but named utility values were not being normalized before theme lookup, which caused matching to fail.\r\n\r\n### What’s changed\r\n\r\n- Added normalization for escaped theme keys\r\n- Ensured named utility values are unescaped before resolving against the theme\r\n- Added tests to cover escaped theme keys in configuration and utility generation\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// tailwind.config.js\r\ntheme: {\r\n  colors: {\r\n    'brand\\\\:primary': '#ff0000',\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/19587","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix utility generaFix utility generation for escaped theme keystion for escaped theme keys\" (#19587)"},{"Id":"3837964113","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-21T12:44:21","Actor":"nightGuest-ye","Number":"19584","RawContent":null,"Title":"Child selectors It works but has no style","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\nFor example: v4.1.18\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nFor example:  Vite 7.2.7\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nFor example: v22.21.0\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nFor example: Chrome 143.0.7499.170\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nFor example:  Windows 10 Version number: 1909\n\n**Describe your issue**\nAs shown in the figure, although the class name is displayed, the style that should be present is not included in the child element selector.

Open the reproduction URL above (or go to https://play.tailwindcss.com/ and manually set it up)\n2. In the **CSS** tab, add:\n   ```css\n   @import \"tailwindcss\" prefix(twd);\n   ```\n3. In the **HTML** tab, add:\n\n   ```html\n   <div\n     class=\"twd:grid twd:grid-cols-1 md:twd:grid-cols-2 lg:twd:grid-cols-3 twd:gap-4\"\n   >\n     <div class=\"twd:bg-blue-500 twd:text-white twd:p-4 twd:rounded\">\n       Item 1\n     </div>\n     <div class=\"twd:bg-green-500 twd:text-white twd:p-4 twd:rounded\">\n       Item 2\n     </div>\n     <div class=\"twd:bg-purple-500 twd:text-white twd:p-4 twd:rounded\">\n       Item 3\n     </div>\n   </div>\n\n   <!-- Comparison: This works without prefix -->\n   <div class=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4 mt-8\">\n     <div class=\"bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded\">Item 1</div>\n     <div class=\"bg-green-500 text-white p-4 rounded\">Item 2</div>\n     <div class=\"bg-purple-500 text-white p-4 rounded\">Item 3</div>\n   </div>\n   ```\n\n4. Resize the preview window or use responsive design mode\n5. Observe that the prefixed grid stays at 1 column at all breakpoints. If you delete the prefix from the css then the non-prefixed grid correctly responds to breakpoints.\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nWhen using a prefix with Tailwind CSS v4, responsive variants (e.g., `md:twd:grid-cols-2`, `lg:twd:grid-cols-3`) are not detected by the content scanner, even though the classes are present in the source files. Base utilities with the prefix work correctly, and responsive variants work correctly without the prefix.\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\n\nTailwind should generate responsive variants for prefixed utilities:\n\n```css\n@media (min-width: 48rem) {\n  .md\\:twd\\:grid-cols-2 {\n    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, minmax(0, 1fr));\n  }\n  .md\\:twd\\:grid-cols-3 {\n    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, minmax(0, 1fr));\n  }\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 64rem) {\n  .lg\\:twd\\:grid-cols-3 {\n    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, minmax(0, 1fr));\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\n\nResponsive variants are **not generated** for prefixed utilities. Only the base utility is generated:\n\n```css\n.twd\\:grid-cols-1 {\n  grid-template-columns: repeat(1, minmax(0, 1fr));\n}\n```\n\nHowever, responsive variants **do work** without the prefix:\n\n```css\n/* This works correctly */\n@media (min-width: 48rem) {\n  .md\\:grid-cols-2 {\n    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, minmax(0, 1fr));\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Verification:**\n\nI verified this is a prefix-specific issue by:\n\n1. Removing the prefix - responsive variants work correctly\n2. Base utilities with prefix work (`twd:grid-cols-1` is generated)\n3. Breakpoints are configured correctly (`.container` has responsive variants)\n4. Content paths are configured correctly (other classes are detected)\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\nThis appears to be a bug in Tailwind v4's content scanner when parsing prefixed responsive variants. The scanner correctly detects:\n\n- Base utilities with prefix (`twd:grid-cols-1`)\n- Responsive variants without prefix (`md:grid-cols-2`)\n- But fails to detect responsive variants with prefix (`md:twd:grid-cols-2`)\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/19543","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Responsive variants not generated when using prefix in Tailwind CSS v4\" (#19543)"},{"Id":"3797689314","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-09T18:51:55","Actor":"Lucifer007-max","Number":"19539","RawContent":null,"Title":"display: none !important; #19538","State":"closed","Body":"Bug  #19538 \r\n\r\nThis change keeps existing behavior intact while reducing selector impact by moving the :where() wrapper to the full selector.\r\n\r\nIt does not remove !important or change semantics, but improves composability for component libraries and advanced overrides","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/19539","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"display: none !important; #19538\" (#19539)"},{"Id":"3797468259","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-09T18:51:44","Actor":"s-kobets","Number":"19538","RawContent":null,"Title":"display: none !important;","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

The <declaration-value> production matches any sequence of one or more tokens, so long as the sequence does not contain bad-string-token, bad-url-token, unmatched )-token, ]-token, or }-token, or top-level semicolon-token tokens or delim-token tokens with a value of \"!\".\r\n\r\nExtract from: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-variables/#syntax\r\n\r\nI was only able to reproduce with **tailwindcss v4**, the previous version seems to support this. This issue is mitigated by the fact that even if you want to use a data URL in a custom property, you would need to wrap the value in a `url()` anyway:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:root { \r\n  --my-icon-url: url('data:image/svg+xml;base64,...==');\r\n}\r\n\r\n.icon {\r\n  background-image: var(--my-icon-url);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich works perfectly fine with the current/latest version (v4.1.8).\r\n\r\nThe fix suggested is to share the same code between regular property and custom property when it comes to detect that the value is a string starting with a `SINGLE_QUOTE` or  `DOUBLE_QUOTE`. I have moved the existing code in a `findEndStringIdx` which returns the position of the ending single/double quote.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18251","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"CSS Parser: Handle string with semi-colon in custom properties.\" (#18251)"},{"Id":"3126887383","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-07T11:27:53","Actor":"markgarrigan","Number":"18248","RawContent":null,"Title":"List bullets don't work with flex items","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

I'm guessing parsing `style` tags calls for parsing Tailwind entry css, which in turns requires parsing all matching source files 🔄.\r\n \r\n---\r\n\r\n```\r\n[...truncated_path...]/*.svelte svelte.preprocess depends on more than 10 external files which can cause slow builds and poor DX, try to reduce them. Found: [list_of_all_source_files_except_raster_images]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly, this is causing a lot of parsing during dev. In our real project with lots of such svelte files, the server quickly crashed with `Maximum Call Stack Size Exceeded`.\r\n\r\n## Use case\r\n\r\nHi all thanks for the good work, Tailwind 4 has been really good and I'm trying to test it out on some existing v3 projects with relatively complex setup. In our case we use tailwind as a postcss plugin because we also rely on some other postcss plugins (mixins, custom properties, custom media queries).

This caused the `-translate-x-full` and `-translate-y-full` utilities to treat `full` as a valid multiple in our spacing scale and created invalid CSS:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.-translate-x-full {\r\n  --tw-translate-x: calc(var(--spacing) * -x-full);\r\n  --tw-translate-y: calc(var(--spacing) * -x-full);\r\n  translate: var(--tw-translate-x) var(--tw-translate-y);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\nI reproduced the issue in our Vite playground and then created a failing test case. It requires a `--spacing` `@theme` variable to be defined so I've added this as a test case now in the unit tests. I also audited all places that are using `calc()` and wrapping some numbers.

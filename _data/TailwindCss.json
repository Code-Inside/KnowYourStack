I had implemented media queries nested inside of selectors which were working just fine in Chrome. However when I was testing in Safari, I realised that nesting media queries inside of selectors is technically invalid syntax, even though Chrome is able to render it.\n\nSo looking into it, I realised that postcss processes the styles into valid markup in build mode, but not in dev mode. So Safari renders it correctly in build mode but not dev mode. \n\nI'm wondering what is the suggested way to use media queries in svelte files then. (I know this is not the preferred utilities-based tailwind syntax, but I have this use-case where I don't want to inline these styles). And also wondering if there is a postcss issue on dev or the aforementioned behaviour is expected.\n\n```\n<style lang=\"postcss\">\n  @reference \"../../app.css\";\n\n  article {\n    columns: auto;\n\n    @media (width >= theme(--breakpoint-lg)) {\n      --visible-columns: 2;\n      columns: calc(min(65ch, (100cqw -

This is not true with `@tailwindcss/postcss`.\n\nThe above repos contain a minimal reproduction case, starting from a fresh React Vite project. Here are the reproduction steps below showing the bug:\n\nWith the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin:\n\n```bash\n$ bun build:client\n$ vite build --outDir build/client --manifest\nvite v6.1.0 building for production...\n✓ 29 modules transformed.\nbuild/client/.vite/manifest.json         0.38 kB │ gzip:  0.21 kB\nbuild/client/index.html                  0.39 kB │ gzip:  0.27 kB\nbuild/client/assets/App-DWNkNxeI.css     6.10 kB │ gzip:  1.79 kB\nbuild/client/assets/index-DO9bOB2u.js  185.88 kB │ gzip: 58.73 kB\n✓ built in 463ms\n\n$ bun build:server\n$ vite build --outDir build/server --ssr=src/entry-ssr.tsx\nvite v6.1.0 building SSR bundle for production...\n✓ 4 modules transformed.\nbuild/server/entry-ssr.js  0.46 kB\n✓ built in 55ms\n\n$ grep App- build/server/entry-ssr.js\nconst stylesheet = \"/assets/App-DX11wV_z.css\";\n```\n\nNote the asset path of the built `App.css` differs between the SSR and client builds (i.e. `App-BYq-i2yi.css !== App-DWNkNxeI.css`). This means that SSR rendered responses have the incorrect asset URL (which leads to a hydration error, if you are hydrating – or a missing CSS asset if you are only SSR rendering).\n\nWith the `@tailwindcss/postcss` based plugin:\n\n```bash\n$ bun build:client\n$ vite build --outDir build/client --manifest\nvite v6.1.0 building for production...\n✓ 29 modules transformed.\nbuild/client/index.html                  0.39 kB │ gzip:  0.27 kB\nbuild/client/.vite/manifest.json         0.40 kB │ gzip:  0.21 kB\nbuild/client/assets/App-BYq-i2yi.css     5.48 kB │ gzip:  1.69 kB\nbuild/client/assets/index-BjxNUz_i.js  185.88 kB │ gzip: 58.73 kB\n✓ built in 594ms\n\n$ bun build:server\n$ vite build --outDir build/server --ssr=src/entry-ssr.tsx\nvite v6.1.0 building SSR bundle for production...\n✓ 4 modules transformed.\nbuild/server/entry-ssr.js  0.46 kB\n✓ built in 193ms\n\n$ grep App- build/server/entry-ssr.js\nconst stylesheet = \"/assets/App-BYq-i2yi.css\";\n```\n\nNote the asset path of the built `App.css` matches the SSR and client builds (i.e. `App-BYq-i2yi.css === App-BYq-i2yi.css`).\n\nLet me know if I can provide any more information.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16389","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Inconsistent CSS assets between client and SSR builds with @tailwindcss/vite\" (#16389)"},{"Id":"2840746984","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-09T15:15:29","Actor":"liamduckett","Number":"16385","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] Radio button selected appearance","State":"open","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\nv4.0.5\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nTailwind Playground\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nFirefox\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nmacOS\n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\n* [v4](https://play.tailwindcss.com/DvC8yvz0vK)\n* [v3](https://play.tailwindcss.com/1rY7RpAW1Y)\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nRadio button appearance has changed upon upgrading to v4. \n\nApologies, I wasn't sure whether to report this as a [tailwindcss-forms](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-forms) issue?\n\n**Cause**\n\nPreviously:\n\n```css\n/* Assign checked background color - higher priority */\n[type=\"radio\"]:checked {\n  /* ... */\n  background-color: currentColor;\n  /* ... */\n}\n\n```css\n/* Assign custom background color - lower priority */\n.bg-gray-100 {\n  /* ... */\n  background-color: rgb(243 244 246 / var(--tw-bg-opacity, 1));\n}\n```\n\nbut now: \n\n```css\n/* Assign checked background color - lower priority */\n@layer base {\n  [type=\"checkbox\"]:checked, [type=\"radio\"]:checked {\n    /* ... */\n    background-color: currentColor;\n    /* ... */\n  }\n}\n\n/* Assign custom background color - higher priority */\n@layer utilities {\n  .bg-gray-100 {\n    background-color: var(--color-gray-100);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThanks!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16385","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[v4] Radio button selected appearance\" (#16385)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-02-12T03:30:22.8395435Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":462}

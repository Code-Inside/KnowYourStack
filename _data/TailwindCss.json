We're a small team and we can't keep up with the volume of issues we receive if we need to reproduce each issue from scratch ourselves.\n\n**Describe your issue**\nWhen using Tailwind CSS v4.1.11 with a Hugo static site and the following config:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  darkMode: 'class',\n  content: [\n    './layouts/**/*.html',\n    './content/**/*.md'\n  ],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      fontFamily: {\n        sans: ['Inter', 'Montserrat', 'sans-serif']\n      },\n      colors: {\n        primary: '#1e3a8a',\n        accent: '#38bdf8',\n        bgLight: '#f8fafc',\n        bgDark: '#181825'\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  plugins: [require('@tailwindcss/typography')],\n}\n```\n\nand running the CLI with:\n\n```\n\"tailwind\": \"tailwindcss -i ./assets/css/tailwind.css --config ./tailwind.config.js --content './layouts/**/*.html,./content/**/*.md' --minify -o static/css/output.css\"\n```\n\nso i initially created this workaround script in package.json, that worked in generating all the styles in output.css and being applied to site (except dark mode was still not working). I think it was still not reading darkMode setting from tailwind.config.js.\n```\n\"tailwind\": \"tailwindcss -i ./assets/css/tailwind.css --config $PWD/tailwind.config.js --content './layouts/**/*.html,./content/**/*.md' --minify > static/css/output.css\"\n```\n\n**Expected**:\nClass-based dark mode utilities (e.g., .dark\\:bg-gray-800) are generated, and toggling the dark class on <html> enables dark mode.\n\n**Actual**:\nOnly media-query-based dark utilities are generated (inside @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { ... }).\nToggling the dark class has no effect.\nDowngrading to Tailwind v3 (e.g., 3.4.3) with the same config and CLI command works perfectly and generates class-based dark utilities.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\nUse the config and CLI command above in a Hugo project.\nInspect the generated CSS for .dark\\:bg-gray-800 or similar class-based selectors.\nObserve that only media-query-based dark utilities are present.\n\n**Environment:**\n- Tailwind CSS v4.1.11\n- Node.js v23.5.0\n- macOS \n- Hugo v0.148.1\n\n**Repo/Minimal** (package.json):\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"modern\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"tailwind\": \"tailwindcss -i ./assets/css/tailwind.css --config $PWD/tailwind.config.js --content './layouts/**/*.html,./content/**/*.md' --minify -o static/css/output.css\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@tailwindcss/cli\": \"^4.1.11\",\n    \"@tailwindcss/typography\": \"^0.5.9\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.21\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8.5.6\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.3\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"browserslist\": \"^4.25.1\",\n    \"caniuse-lite\": \"^1.0.30001727\",\n    \"electron-to-chromium\": \"^1.5.182\",\n    \"escalade\": \"^3.2.0\",\n    \"fraction.js\": \"^4.3.7\",\n    \"nanoid\": \"^3.3.11\",\n    \"node-releases\": \"^2.0.19\",\n    \"normalize-range\": \"^0.1.2\",\n    \"picocolors\": \"^1.1.1\",\n    \"postcss-value-parser\": \"^4.2.0\",\n    \"source-map-js\": \"^1.2.1\",\n    \"update-browserslist-db\": \"^1.1.3\"\n  },\n  \"description\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\nUsing the -o flag, absolute config path, and all recommended CLI options does not resolve the issue.\nThis breaks all class-based dark mode toggling for Hugo and similar static site generators.\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18547","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"darkMode: 'class' not respected in Tailwind CSS v4 CLI with Hugo (class-based dark utilities not generated)\" (#18547)"},{"Id":"3222924520","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-15T18:41:05","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"18511","RawContent":null,"Title":"Center the dropdown icon added to an input with a paired datalist in Chrome","State":"closed","Body":"This PR tweaks the dropdown arrow added to an input by Chrome when it has a `list` attribute pointing to a `<datalist>`.\r\n\r\nRight now the arrow isn't centered vertically:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"227\" height=\"58\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-07-14 at 15 41 50\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b354a5e8-432d-432d-bfe4-f7b6f6683548\" />\r\n\r\nThe cause of this is the line height being inherited into the pseudo element which controls how the marker is positioned.

It loads an `index.css` file from the Tailwind `node_modules` folder, as well as my own custom `root.css` file, which includes `@import 'tailwindcss'`. My CSS file includes the correct dark mode declarations, but the `index.css` file does not, which mixes up the declarations if you choose a color mode that is not the current `prefers-color-scheme`.\n\n<img width=\"1922\" height=\"940\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf04da75-2b34-4a8c-ab87-30577539a51e\" />\n\nSo I ended up with two versions of Tailwind  v4.1.11, each with CSS declarations that contradict each other.\n\n<img width=\"1682\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7600609-fa18-4a8a-885e-ec417c7669b2\" />\n\nI have already tried various methods of debugging and fixing it, but with no success.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18539","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Problem with dark mode because Tailwind v4 loads two CSS versions in dev mode\" (#18539)"},{"Id":"3229150681","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-14T15:59:51","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"18535","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update @emnapi/core 1.4.3 → 1.4.4 (patch)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

This breaks the CSS and results in styles not rendering properly on the page.\n\nI'm using the latest version of `tailwind` in a `sveltekit` project with the default configuration. I also tested this in the official `tw` playground and I see the same behavior. Screenshots are attached so you can immediately see that something's wrong.\n\n<img width=\"375\" height=\"165\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e57fd84-205a-4972-b4b2-4985582f8faf\" />\n\n<img width=\"946\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e8270f5-f457-4ca4-90d6-aebc825f7742\" />\n\n<img width=\"347\" height=\"155\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cebcd21f-f6f8-4b8a-9738-0ef031dd9ef0\" />\n\n[Playground link](https://play.tailwindcss.com/U04WjTgJzA?file=css)\n\nI spent more than half an hour trying to find the problem. After renaming the custom variable, everything worked fine again. I believe this should be addressed, since CSS variables `--custom-name` and `tw` utilities `.custom-name` are diffirent concepts and shouldn't interfere with each other.\n\nI'm running into this because I want to define a custom utils and vars for variable font in the `@theme` config:\n\n```css\n@theme {\n  --font-400: 'wght' 400;\n  --font-ss-3: 'ss03' 1;\n}\n```\n\nSo I can use it later with custom util:\n\n```css\n@utility font-400 {\n  font-variation-settings: var(--font-400);\n}\n\n@utility font-ss-3 {\n  font-feature-settings: var(--font-ss-3);\n}\n```\n\nor via custom css directly if needed:\n\n```css\np {\n  font-variation-settings: var(--font-600);\n  font-feature-settings: var(--font-ss-3);\n}\n```\n\nThese variable names should remain isolated, custom properties under `@theme` shouldn’t conflict with custom `@utilities`.\n\n**In short**: everything works as expected unless a custom `@theme` variable shares its name with a custom `@utility`, in that case, CSS breaks due to conflicting class generation.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18529","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Unexpected behavior when custom `@theme` vars and `@utility` share same names\" (#18529)"},{"Id":"3223761839","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-14T14:06:09","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"18513","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update eslint 9.29.0 → 9.30.1 (minor)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

This pattern worked in Tailwind CSS v3 but appears broken in v4.\n\nIn particular, combining `@apply` with responsive and pseudo-class utilities inside Angular's SCSS context (`::ng-deep`) no longer compiles or applies styles as it used to.\n\n---\n\n### Example SCSS Code Illustrating the Problem:\n\n```scss\n@use '@angular/material' as mat;\n@reference 'tailwindcss';\n\n:host {\n  ::ng-deep {\n    .task-list {\n      @include mat.form-field-density(-1);\n\n      @apply hover:md:bg-red-500; // ❌ Not working in v4, worked in v3\n\n      &:hover {\n        @apply md:bg-red-500; // ❌ Not working in v4, worked in v3\n      }\n\n      .mdc-label {\n        @apply font-medium text-red-500; // ✅ Still works\n      }\n\n      .mat-mdc-checkbox-checked {\n        @apply pointer-events-none opacity-50;\n\n        .mdc-label {\n          @apply line-through!; // ✅ Still works\n        }\n      }\n\n      .action-trigger {\n        @apply md:opacity-0; // ❌ Not working as it did in v3 — no longer hidden on large screens\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThese patterns are used widely across our large Angular application, and after the v4 upgrade, many component styles have silently broken. While base utilities like `@apply text-red-500` still function, any usage of `@apply` with media queries or pseudo-classes(hover,placeholder...) appears to be ignored or stripped during build.\n\n### Impact\nThis is a critical issue for us:\n- We have a large codebase heavily reliant on these patterns.\n- Refactoring hundreds of components manually would be a major setback.\n- There was no mention of this change in the upgrade guide as of now.\n\n### Please confirm:\n\n- Is this behavior expected in Tailwind CSS v4?\n- Was support for `@apply + media/pseudo` utilities removed by design?\n- If so, is there a workaround or plugin we can adopt short-term?\n\nAny guidance or fix would be hugely appreciated. We're happy to provide further context or contribute to a fix if this is unintended.\n\nThank you!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18519","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[v4] Regression: Media queries inside @apply not working as expected compared to v3\" (#18519)"},{"Id":"3225388864","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-12T17:40:26","Actor":"mwnciau","Number":"18516","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unable to set property value to \"inherit\" in the CSS config","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\nv4.0.9\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nElixir Phoenix using the Tailwind 0.3.1 elixir package, built using the esbuild 0.9.0 elixir package, which is using esbuild 0.17.11\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nv22.16.0\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nFirefox\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nUbuntu\n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\nhttps://play.tailwindcss.com/vJ8zniNWjT\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nIt is impossible to set a custom theme variable to \"inherit\" using a CSS config.

While both the original hex value (e.g., #fb2c3600) and the color-mix output are fully transparent, they are not identical.\n\nThis bug can lead to unexpected behavior because #fb2c3600 is not the same as #0000, which is the effective result of the color-mix fallback.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**\n\n```\n@theme {\n  --color-red-a0: --alpha(var(--color-red-500) / 0%);\n  --color-red-a50: --alpha(var(--color-red-500) / 50%);\n}\n```\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\n```\n@layer theme {\n  :root,\n  :host {\n  --color-red-a0: #fb2c3600;\n  --color-red-a50: #fb2c3680;\n\n  @supports (color: lab(0% 0 0)) {\n    --color-red-a0: lab(55.4814% 75.0732 48.8528 / 0%);\n    --color-red-a50: lab(55.4814% 75.0732 48.8528 / 50%);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Actual behavior**\n\n```\n@layer theme {\n  :root,\n  :host {\n  --color-red-a0: #0000;\n  --color-red-a50: #fb2c3680;\n\n  @supports (color: color-mix(in lab, red, red)) {\n    :root,\n    :host {\n      --color-red-a0: color-mix(in oklab, var(--color-red-500) 0%, transparent);\n      --color-red-a50: color-mix(in oklab, var(--color-red-500) 50%, transparent);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nwhere --color-red-a50 are the same in both cases, but --color-red-a0 are not. \n\n**Why this matters**\n\nWhile both colors #fb2c3600 and #0000 are fully transparent, the loss of the original components can lead to incorrect rendering in specific scenarios where the browser relies on the underlying color values. For example, in CSS Gradients: when creating a gradient that fades to transparency (e.g., linear-gradient(#fb2c36, #fb2c3600)), the browser smoothly transitions from the solid color to a transparent version of the same color. However, with the bug, the gradient would transition to transparent black, which can create an unintended visual shift toward black before fading out.\n\nThis behavior violates the principle of least astonishment by discarding explicit user data and is a critical flaw for projects relying on precise color management.\n\n**Playground link**\n[https://play.tailwindcss.com/Xjil35jX2I](https://play.tailwindcss.com/Xjil35jX2I)","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18508","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"--alpha function loses base color for fully transparent hex values\" (#18508)"},{"Id":"3220240794","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-10T18:58:29","Actor":"TruffleClock","Number":"18503","RawContent":null,"Title":"`shadow-md` is broken on iOS 26","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

I followed the official setup steps, but when I used the latest version of Tailwind (`tailwindcss@3.4.x`), the app failed to compile. Here's the error I got:\n\nError: It looks like you're trying to use tailwindcss directly as a PostCSS plugin...\n\nAt first, I thought I had made a mistake. But after hours of debugging, I found that the issue is due to recent changes in how Tailwind's PostCSS plugin works internally. CRA doesn’t support the new setup without extra configuration or ejecting, which many beginners may not realize.\n\nEventually, I fixed the issue by downgrading to these versions:\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18481","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"TailwindCSS 3.4+ not working with Create React App (CRA) – compatibility issue not clear\" (#18481)"},{"Id":"3210721732","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-08T12:17:59","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"18477","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update @vitejs/plugin-react 4.5.2 → 4.6.0 (minor)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

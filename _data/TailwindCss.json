[Preflight](https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@3.1.8/src/css/preflight.css) contains the following:\r\n```css\r\n/*\r\n1. Make replaced elements `display: block` by default. (https://github.com/mozdevs/cssremedy/issues/14)\r\n2. Add `vertical-align: middle` to align replaced elements more sensibly by default. (https://github.com/jensimmons/cssremedy/issues/14#issuecomment-634934210)\r\n   This can trigger a poorly considered lint error in some tools but is included by design.\r\n*/\r\n\r\nimg,\r\nsvg,\r\nvideo,\r\ncanvas,\r\naudio,\r\niframe,\r\nembed,\r\nobject {\r\n  display: block; /* 1 */\r\n  vertical-align: middle; /* 2 */\r\n}\r\n```\r\nUnfortunately that doesn't work well if any of those elements have the `hidden` attribute. Browsers implement `hidden` with `display: none`, but the Tailwind preflight class has a higher specificity and so overrides it.\r\n\r\nI was wondering about the safest way to fix this without increasing specificity in a way that could break things. What's Tailwind's browser support policy say about using `:where()` for this kind of thing? I'm thinking that using the following structure would be ideal, but it wouldn't work on [older browsers that lack support](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_selectors_where).\r\n\r\n```css\r\niframe:not(:where([hidden])) {\r\n  display:block;\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/9165","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Preflight display declaration for iframe, img, etc. overrides the hidden attribute\" (#9165)"},{"Id":"1350012411","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-24T21:05:44","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"9174","RawContent":null,"Title":"Honor the `hidden` attribute on elements in preflight","State":"closed","Body":"You’ll still be able to override this with utilities but this ensures that things like `<iframe hidden>` work as expected.\r\n\r\nFixes #9165","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/9174","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Honor the `hidden` attribute on elements in preflight\" (#9174)"},{"Id":"1349851703","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-24T18:47:59","Actor":"greatislander","Number":"9172","RawContent":null,"Title":"divide utility doesn't work properly when there's a <template> tag in the markup","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\nTailwind v2.2.19\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\npostcss v8.4.14, vite v2.9.13\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\nNode v16.15.1\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\n\r\nSafari 15.6.1, Firefox 104.0\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\n\r\nmacOS 12.5.1\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\n\r\nhttps://codepen.io/greatislander/pen/VwXNqxK\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nThe `divide` utility uses the general sibling combinator with `:not([hidden])` to ensure that borders are only inserted between visible elements.

Incorrect placement of element selectors when multiple classes are joined in a selector\r\n\r\nGiven:\r\n```css\r\n.foo.bar { color: red; }\r\nsection { @apply bar; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe would naively replace the .bar portion with `section` producing `.foosection` which is obviously wrong. This did _not_ happen when applying `foo` because this simple replacement produced something that happened to be correct `section.bar`.\r\n\r\n2. ~Only replacing the first occurrence of a candidate in a selector:~ (reverted due to this not being 100% correct either)\r\n\r\nGiven:\r\n```css\r\n.foo + .foo { color: red; }\r\nsection { @apply foo; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe would produce:\r\n```css\r\nsection + .foo { color: red; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not correct because the `foo` class may not even _exist_ at all if `.foo + .foo` is defined in the `components` or `utilities` layers.\r\n\r\nFixes #9093\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/9107","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix `@apply` selector rewriting when multiple classes are involved\" (#9107)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2022-08-28T03:30:30.9355973Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":1209}

Reduce array allocations while walking to build a `path` to the current node. This re-uses the existing `path` array and pushes the current node before the recursive call and pops it afterwards. This way we don't need to allocate a new array for each recursive call. Testing this on Tailwind UI means ~14k fewer allocations.\r\n2.

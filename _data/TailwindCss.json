It works well in Firefox. When the output is built for prod, Lightning CSS flattens the output and the final version works in both browsers.

However, this causes inconsistencies because **media queries in browsers do not respect a custom `rootFontSize`**—leading to incorrect breakpoint calculations.\n\nThe Tailwind VS Code extension correctly calculates pixel equivalents based on the configured `tailwindCSS.rootFontSize`, but browsers **always interpret `1rem = 16px` in media queries, ignoring any custom font size settings**.\n\n---\n\n#### **Expected Behavior**  \nIf `tailwindCSS.rootFontSize` is set to `15px`, the VS Code extension displays:  \n\n```css\n.sm\\:bg-green-100 {\n  @media (width >= 40rem /* 600px */) {\n    background-color: var(--color-green-100);\n  }\n}\n```\n- The `40rem /* 600px */` part suggests that `1rem = 15px`, which aligns with the expected base font size.\n\n---\n\n#### **Actual Behavior**  \n- **Browsers do not respect `rootFontSize` in media queries** and always interpret `1rem = 16px`, meaning `40rem = 640px`, not 600px.  \n- This leads to a situation where using `rem` for breakpoints is **not only inconvenient but also functionally incorrect in media queries**.  \n\n---\n\n#### **Steps to Reproduce**\n1. Set the base font size to `15px` (either via `addBase` in Tailwind config or using plain CSS:  \n   ```css\n   html { font-size: 15px; }\n   ```\n2. Use a `sm:bg-green-100` class in Tailwind.\n3. Observe the Tailwind VS Code extension displaying:  \n   ```css\n   @media (width < 40rem /* 600px */) { flex-wrap: wrap; }\n   ```\n4. Check the actual media query behavior in a browser using DevTools:  \n   - The breakpoint still applies at **640px, not 600px**, proving that browsers ignore the custom font size in media queries.\n\n#### **Screenshots**\nIncorrect calculations in the VS Code extension vs. actual browser behavior:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b858cafb-0d4b-4816-b250-3d8fbac3baa1)  \n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e6cb28f-1e07-4773-93b2-2839ce0fcb62)  \n\n---\n\n### **Proposed Fix**\n- **Option A:** The VS Code extension should always assume `1rem = 16px` in media queries, regardless of `tailwindCSS.rootFontSize`, ensuring the correct pixel values (`40rem = 640px`, not 600px) are displayed.  \n- **Option B:** Revert breakpoints to use `px` instead of `rem`, as `rem` does not behave as expected in media queries.  \n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16415","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`rem`-based Media queries do not respect custom base font size in browser\" (#16415)"},{"Id":"2841930260","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-10T22:01:27","Actor":"dany68","Number":"16401","RawContent":null,"Title":"/lib/util/flattenColorPalette.js is not defined by \"exports\"","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\nTailwind v4.0.5\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nVite, nuxtjs app, @tailwindcss/vite@4.0.5\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nNode v22.12.0\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nChrome\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nmacOS\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nHi after upgrading to v4.0.5 from v4.0.3 i get the following error during npm run dev and build:\n\n```\nPre-transform error: Package subpath './lib/util/flattenColorPalette.js' is not defined by \"exports\" in /Users/daniel/Documents/Perso/site-nuxt/node_modules/tailwindcss/package.json\n  Plugin: @tailwindcss/vite:generate:serve\n  File: /Users/daniel/Documents/Perso/site-nuxt/assets/css/main.css\n```\n\nWhen i try to downgrade back to 4.0.3 i get the same error, so maybe it is related to tailwindcss/vite.\n\nHere is my nuxt config related to tailwind:\n```\ncss: [\n    '~/assets/css/main.css'\n],\n\nvite: {\n    build: {\n        cssMinify: 'lightningcss'\n    },\n    plugins: [\n        tailwindcss(),\n    ],\n},\n```\n\n<img width=\"1265\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f75ca0b6-dbe4-44d6-98c4-8a8e0b8a8317\" />\n\nEverything was working fine before the upgrade.\nThanks for your help,","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16401","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"/lib/util/flattenColorPalette.js is not defined by \"exports\"\" (#16401)"},{"Id":"2843139749","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-10T22:01:26","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"16411","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add `tailwindcss/lib/util/flattenColorPalette.js` export","State":"closed","Body":"Closes #16401\r\n\r\nThis adds a `tailwindcss/lib/util/flattenColorPalette.js` (notice the `.js` suffix) inline with our other exports.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/16411","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add `tailwindcss/lib/util/flattenColorPalette.js` export\" (#16411)"},{"Id":"2841297492","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-10T16:34:59","Actor":"sparanoid","Number":"16396","RawContent":null,"Title":"`@theme inline` does not work with variables inside `calc`","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

Open a Tailwind-powered webpage on Chrome for Android 14\n\n3. Compare the rendering of the following component:\n```\n<React.Fragment>\n   <div className=\"flex justify-center items-center gap-2 sm:m-4 flex-col sm:w-96 w-64 sm:p-6 p-3 m-0 bg-white border border-gray-200 rounded-lg shadow\">\n     <div className=\"mb-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-800\">\n       <span>{cardProps.heading}</span>\n     </div>\n     <div className=\"font-semibold text-xl text-gray-800\">\n       <span>{cardProps.total}</span>\n     </div>\n   </div>\n </React.Fragment>\n```\n\n4. Observe that one card applies styles correctly, while another does not display font-semibold text-xl text-gray-800 correctly.\n\n6. Test the same page in Firefox for Android or desktop Chrome → styles apply correctly.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16366","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Tailwind CSS Classes Not Working on Chrome for Android 14\" (#16366)"},{"Id":"2840976878","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-09T21:49:47","Actor":"maiconcarraro","Number":"16395","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] space-y-* and labels have a different behavior compared to v3 (no upgrade information)","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

This means that SSR rendered responses have the incorrect asset URL (which leads to a hydration error, if you are hydrating – or a missing CSS asset if you are only SSR rendering).\n\nWith the `@tailwindcss/postcss` based plugin:\n\n```bash\n$ bun build:client\n$ vite build --outDir build/client --manifest\nvite v6.1.0 building for production...\n✓ 29 modules transformed.\nbuild/client/index.html                  0.39 kB │ gzip:  0.27 kB\nbuild/client/.vite/manifest.json         0.40 kB │ gzip:  0.21 kB\nbuild/client/assets/App-BYq-i2yi.css     5.48 kB │ gzip:  1.69 kB\nbuild/client/assets/index-BjxNUz_i.js  185.88 kB │ gzip: 58.73 kB\n✓ built in 594ms\n\n$ bun build:server\n$ vite build --outDir build/server --ssr=src/entry-ssr.tsx\nvite v6.1.0 building SSR bundle for production...\n✓ 4 modules transformed.\nbuild/server/entry-ssr.js  0.46 kB\n✓ built in 193ms\n\n$ grep App- build/server/entry-ssr.js\nconst stylesheet = \"/assets/App-BYq-i2yi.css\";\n```\n\nNote the asset path of the built `App.css` matches the SSR and client builds (i.e. `App-BYq-i2yi.css === App-BYq-i2yi.css`).\n\nLet me know if I can provide any more information.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16389","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Inconsistent CSS assets between client and SSR builds with @tailwindcss/vite\" (#16389)"},{"Id":"2840746984","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-09T15:15:29","Actor":"liamduckett","Number":"16385","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] Radio button selected appearance","State":"open","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\nv4.0.5\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nTailwind Playground\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nFirefox\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nmacOS\n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\n* [v4](https://play.tailwindcss.com/DvC8yvz0vK)\n* [v3](https://play.tailwindcss.com/1rY7RpAW1Y)\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nRadio button appearance has changed upon upgrading to v4. \n\nApologies, I wasn't sure whether to report this as a [tailwindcss-forms](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-forms) issue?\n\n**Cause**\n\nPreviously:\n\n```css\n/* Assign checked background color - higher priority */\n[type=\"radio\"]:checked {\n  /* ... */\n  background-color: currentColor;\n  /* ... */\n}\n\n```css\n/* Assign custom background color - lower priority */\n.bg-gray-100 {\n  /* ... */\n  background-color: rgb(243 244 246 / var(--tw-bg-opacity, 1));\n}\n```\n\nbut now: \n\n```css\n/* Assign checked background color - lower priority */\n@layer base {\n  [type=\"checkbox\"]:checked, [type=\"radio\"]:checked {\n    /* ... */\n    background-color: currentColor;\n    /* ... */\n  }\n}\n\n/* Assign custom background color - higher priority */\n@layer utilities {\n  .bg-gray-100 {\n    background-color: var(--color-gray-100);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThanks!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16385","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[v4] Radio button selected appearance\" (#16385)"},{"Id":"2840300330","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-08T22:09:38","Actor":"adamwathan","Number":"16376","RawContent":null,"Title":"Preserve custom properties in keyframes","State":"open","Body":"Closes #16374\r\n\r\nEnsure we don't remove custom properties from within `@keyframe` declarations.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/16376","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Preserve custom properties in keyframes\" (#16376)"},{"Id":"2840286527","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-08T21:33:15","Actor":"ramrami","Number":"16374","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4.0.5] Used css variables are removed from @keyframes","State":"open","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\nv4.0.5\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nGulp + Postcss\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nv20\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nBrave\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nmacOS\n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\nhttps://play.tailwindcss.com/4MlgazRExq?file=css\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nGiven this setup\n```css\n@property --angle {\n  inherits: true;\n  initial-value: 0deg;\n  syntax: '<angle>';\n}\n\n@theme {\n  --animate-rotate-angle: rotate-angle 2s infinite linear;

Almost everything is working except for the \"meteors\" CSS effect at the top of the screen. During local or production builds the outputted CSS seems to be missing some chunks of some kind as the component does not render.\n\nAfter a bit of digging when making a reproduction, I discovered that it is caused by using the [`client:only` directive](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#clientonly) in Astro (Other directives could affect it, I have not tested it). When I remove that directive the local / production builds output the correct CSS needed for the \"meteors\" component to render correctly.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16371","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Astro `client:only` directive omits styles in builds\" (#16371)"},{"Id":"2839696613","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-08T08:01:10","Actor":"jordimarimon","Number":"16365","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] Angular host class binding not detected","State":"open","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\nv4.0.4\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nAngular v19 with `@tailwindcss/postcss`.\n\nI followed this guide: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/angular\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nv22.12.0\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nN/A\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nLinux\n\n**Reproduction**\n\nTo reproduce the issue:\n\n- **1.** Create a new file with the following content (in my example I name the file `foo.component.ts`):\n\n```typescript\n// Angular is not needed because I'm going to use the scanner directly for reproducing the issue\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n\n@Component({\n    selector: 'app-foo',\n    template: '',\n    host: {\n        '[class.min-h-dvh]': 'true',\n    },\n})\nexport class FooComponent {\n\n}\n```\n\n- **2.** Create a js file with the following content (in my example I name the file `scan.js`):\n\n```javascript\nimport { Scanner } from '@tailwindcss/oxide';\nimport * as fs from 'node:fs/promises';\n\n\nconst content = await fs.readFile('foo.component.ts', 'utf-8');\nconst scanner = new Scanner({});\nconst candidates = scanner.scanFiles([{content, extension: 'ts'}]);\n\nconsole.log(candidates);\n```\n\n- **3.** Execute the script in a shell:\n\n```shell\nnode scan.js\n```\n\nThis is the output I get:\n\n```text\n[\n  '@Component',      '@angular/core',\n  'app-foo',         'class',\n  'class.min-h-dvh', 'export',\n  'from',            'host',\n  'import',          'selector',\n  'template',        'true'\n]\n```\n\nI would expect to see `min-h-dvh` instead of `class.min-h-dvh`.\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nI don't know anything about rust yet so I can't help a lot but I see this line in the code:\n\nhttps://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/main/crates/oxide/src/lib.rs#L451\n\nI don't know if it should also consider typescript files for Angular projects.\n\nI don't use the scanner directly, I use the postcss tailwind plugin, I just wanted to minimiza as much as possible the reproduction of the issue so it would be easier to debug.\n\nI created this issue because when using Tailwind v4 in an Angular project any class that I define using the host class binding, is not being generated.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16365","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[v4] Angular host class binding not detected\" (#16365)"},{"Id":"2839623370","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-08T05:46:06","Actor":"johnadrian63","Number":"16364","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] Angular compilation errors in Docker are preventing TailwindCSS from working.","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

Since this is a module in Vite's module graph, this gets scanned for class candidates by Tailwind. It sees `after:content-[&#39;&#39;]` as a valid class and generates a rule for it:\n\n```css\n.after\\:content-\\[\\&\\#39\\;\\&\\#39\\;\\] {\n  &::after {\n    content: var(--tw-content);\n    --tw-content: &#39;&#39;;\n    content: var(--tw-content);\n  }\n}\n```\nAnd then when the default PostCSS pipeline in Nuxt runs on this, it errors out:\n```\n ERROR  Nuxt Build Error: [vite:css] [postcss] /path/to/project/assets/css/main.css:128:24: Unknown word                                                                                  nuxi 11:01:10 PM\nfile: /path/to/project/assets/css/main.css:128:23\n\n    file: assets/css/main.css:128:23\n    at Input.error (node_modules/postcss/lib/input.js:109:16)\n    at Parser.unknownWord (node_modules/postcss/lib/parser.js:593:22)\n    at Parser.other (node_modules/postcss/lib/parser.js:435:12)\n    at Parser.parse (node_modules/postcss/lib/parser.js:470:16)\n    at parse (node_modules/postcss/lib/parse.js:11:12)\n    at new LazyResult (node_modules/postcss/lib/lazy-result.js:133:16)\n    at Processor.process (node_modules/postcss/lib/processor.js:53:14)\n    at compileCSS (node_modules/vite/dist/node/chunks/dep-M1IYMR16.js:48784:59)\n    at async Object.transform (node_modules/vite/dist/node/chunks/dep-M1IYMR16.js:48039:11)\n    at async transform (node_modules/rollup/dist/es/shared/node-entry.js:19787:16)\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16358","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Vue static vdom stringifier breaks PostCSS in Nuxt Production build\" (#16358)"},{"Id":"2839075939","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-07T21:20:35","Actor":"mckoda09","Number":"16354","RawContent":null,"Title":"@tailwindcss/vite spamming path of css files","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\nv4.0.4\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nAstro v5.2.5\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nBun v1.2.1\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nYandex Browser\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nWindows\n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\nhttps://github.com/mckoda09/tailwind-repro\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\n![Issue](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/933e5582-3dcd-4999-92d6-26cc80073af1)","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16354","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"@tailwindcss/vite spamming path of css files\" (#16354)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-02-11T03:30:23.2076143Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":436}

This is because Vite rebuilds files when _any_ of its transitive dependencies change.\r\n\r\nFor example, given this Vue file:\r\n```vue\r\n<style>\r\n@reference \"./styles.css\";\r\n</style>\r\n<template> <!-- ... --> </template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this stylesheet:\r\n```css\r\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe dependency chain looks like this: `file.vue -> styles.css -> {all the sources in your project}`\r\n\r\nVite sees that a file (e.g. `index.html`) has changed, thus `styles.css` needs change, which means `file.vue` needs to be compiled again as well. Now in reality we depend on the _on disk_ version of styles.css not the compiled version but Vite itself doesn't know that (or have a way to indicate this afaik).\r\n\r\nComing up with a solution to that problem will have to be a separate PR — but there is a workaround:\r\n\r\n### 1. Inline the imports from `@import \"tailwindcss\";`\r\n\r\nReplace this in your main stylesheet:\r\n```css\r\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith this (this is basically what `node_modules/tailwindcss/index.css` is):\r\n```css\r\n@layer theme, base, components, utilities;\r\n\r\n@import 'tailwindcss/theme' layer(theme);\r\n@import 'tailwindcss/preflight' layer(base);\r\n@import 'tailwindcss/utilities' layer(utilities);\r\n\r\n/* the rest of your styles imports, styles, etc… */\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Split your stylesheet into \"main\" and \"theme\" parts\r\n\r\nYour \"theme\" is comprised of the `@import 'tailwindcss/theme' layer(theme);` import, any custom `@theme` blocks, any `@config` directives, and any `@plugin` directives. Move all of these into their own file.\r\n\r\nFor example, replace this with two files:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@layer theme, base, components, utilities;\r\n@import 'tailwindcss/theme' layer(theme);\r\n@import 'tailwindcss/preflight' layer(base);\r\n@import 'tailwindcss/utilities' layer(utilities);\r\n\r\n@theme {\r\n  --color-primary: #c0ffee;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@plugin \"./my-plugin.js\";\r\n\r\n/* the rest of your styles imports, styles, etc… */\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith a theme file:\r\n```css\r\n@import 'tailwindcss/theme' layer(theme);\r\n\r\n/* all your `@theme` stuff goes in this file */\r\n@theme {\r\n  --color-primary: #c0ffee;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* additionally any @config or @plugin does too */\r\n@plugin \"./my-plugin.js\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nand your main CSS file:\r\n```css\r\n@layer theme, base, components, utilities;\r\n@import './my-theme.css'; /* I replaced this import */\r\n@import 'tailwindcss/preflight' layer(base);\r\n@import 'tailwindcss/utilities' layer(utilities);\r\n\r\n/* the rest of your styles imports, styles, etc… */\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Import only your \"theme\" file in your Vue components / CSS modules / etc…\r\n\r\n```vue\r\n<style>\r\n@reference \"./my-theme.css\";\r\n</style>\r\n<template> <!-- ... --> </template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes #17693\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17836","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Ignore `@tailwind utilities` inside `@reference`\" (#17836)"},{"Id":"3039962459","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-05T15:06:25","Actor":"rettimo","Number":"17880","RawContent":null,"Title":"bg-[length:XX_XX] do not work correctly","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

But I've been thinking about a system where we can automate this process away. This PR introduces this system.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces upgrade migrations based on the internal Design System, and it mainly updates arbitrary variants, arbitrary properties and arbitrary values.\r\n\r\n## The problem\r\n\r\nWhenever we ship new utilities, or you make changes to your CSS file by introducing new `@theme` values, or adding new `@utility` rules. It could be that the rest of your codebase isn't aware of that, but you could be using these values.\r\n\r\nFor example, it could be that you have a lot of arbitrary properties in your codebase, they look something like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"[color-scheme:dark] [text-wrap:balance]\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever we introduce new features in Tailwind CSS, you probably don't keep an eye on the release notes and update all of these arbitrary properties to the newly introduced utilities.\r\n\r\nBut with this PR, we can run the upgrade tool:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nnpx -y @tailwindcss/upgrade@latest\r\n```\r\n\r\n...and it will upgrade your project to use the new utilities:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"scheme-dark text-balance\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt also works for arbitrary values, for example imagine you have classes like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Arbitrary property -->\r\n<div class=\"[max-height:1lh]\"></div>\r\n\r\n<!-- Arbitrary value -->\r\n<div class=\"max-h-[1lh]\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning the upgrade tool again:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nnpx -y @tailwindcss/upgrade@latest\r\n```\r\n\r\n... gives you the following output:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Arbitrary property -->\r\n<div class=\"max-h-lh\"></div>\r\n\r\n<!-- Arbitrary value -->\r\n<div class=\"max-h-lh\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because of the original PR I mentioned, which introduced the `max-h-lh` utilities.\r\n\r\nA nice benefit is that this output only has 1 unique class instead of 2, which also potentially reduces the size of your CSS file.\r\n\r\nIt could also be that you are using arbitrary values where you (or a team member) didn't even know an alternative solution existed.\r\n\r\nE.g.:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"w-[48rem]\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter running the upgrade tool you will get this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"w-3xl\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can go further though. Since the release of Tailwind CSS v4, we introduced the concept of \"bare values\". Essentially allowing you to type a number on utilities where it makes sense, and we produce a value based on that number.\r\n\r\nSo an input like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"border-[123px]\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill be optimized to just:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"border-123\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be very useful for complex utilities, for example, how many times have you written something like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"grid-cols-[repeat(16,minmax(0,1fr))]\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause up until Tailwind CSS v4, we only generated 12 columns by default. But since v4, we can generate any number of columns automatically.\r\n\r\nRunning the migration tool will give you this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"grid-cols-16\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### User CSS\r\n\r\nBut, what if I told you that we can keep going...\r\n\r\nIn [Catalyst](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-kit) we often use classes that look like this for accessibility reasons:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"text-[CanvasText] bg-[Highlight]\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat if you want to move the `CanvasText` and `Highlight` colors to your CSS:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@import \"tailwincdss\";\r\n\r\n@theme {\r\n  --color-canvas: CanvasText;\r\n  --color-highlight: Highlight;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you now run the upgrade tool again, this will be the result:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"text-canvas bg-highlight\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe never shipped a `text-canvas` or `bg-highlight` utility, but the upgrade tool uses your own CSS configuration to migrate your codebase.\r\n\r\nThis will keep your codebase clean, consistent and modern and you are in control.\r\n\r\nLet's look at one more example, what if you have this in a lot of places:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"[scrollbar-gutter:stable]\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you don't want to wait for the Tailwind CSS team to ship a `scrollbar-stable` (or similar) feature. You can add your own utility:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@import \"tailwincdss\";\r\n\r\n@utility scrollbar-stable {\r\n  scrollbar-gutter: stable;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"scrollbar-stable\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The solution — how it works\r\n\r\nThere are 2 big things happening here:\r\n\r\n1. Instead of us (the Tailwind CSS team) hardcoding certain migrations, we will make use of the internal `DesignSystem` which is the source of truth for all this information. This is also what Tailwind CSS itself uses to generate the CSS file.\r\n\r\n   The internal `DesignSystem` is essentially a list of all:\r\n\r\n   1. The internal utilities\r\n   2. The internal variants\r\n   3. The default theme we ship\r\n   4. The user CSS\r\n      1. With custom `@theme` values\r\n      2. With custom `@custom-variant` implementations\r\n      3. With custom `@utility` implementations\r\n2. The upgrade tool now has a concept of `signatures`\r\n\r\nThe signatures part is the most interesting one, and it allows us to be 100% sure that we can migrate your codebase without breaking anything.\r\n\r\nA signature is some unique identifier that represents a utility. But 2 utilities that do the exact same thing will have the same signature.\r\n\r\nTo make this work, we have to make sure that we normalize values. One such value is the selector. I think a little visualization will help here:\r\n\r\n| UTILITY          | GENERATED SIGNATURE     |\r\n| ---------------- | ----------------------- |\r\n| `[display:flex]` | `.x { display: flex; }` |\r\n| `flex`           | `.x { display: flex; }` |\r\n\r\nThey have the exact same signature and therefore the upgrade tool can safely migrate them to the same utility.\r\n\r\nFor this we will prefer the following order:\r\n\r\n1. Static utilities — essentially no brackets. E.g.: `flex`, `grid-cols-2`\r\n2. Arbitrary values — e.g.: `max-h-[1lh]`, `border-[2px]`\r\n3. Arbitrary properties — e.g.: `[color-scheme:dark]`, `[display:flex]`\r\n\r\nWe also have to canonicalize utilities to there minimal form. Essentially making sure we increase the chance of finding a match.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[display:_flex_] → [display:flex] → flex\r\n[display:_flex]  → [display:flex] → flex\r\n[display:flex_]  → [display:flex] → flex\r\n[display:flex]   → [display:flex] → flex\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we don't do this, then the signatures will be slightly different, due to the whitespace:\r\n\r\n| UTILITY            | GENERATED SIGNATURE       |\r\n| ------------------ | ------------------------- |\r\n| `[display:_flex_]` | `.x { display:  flex ; }` |\r\n| `[display:_flex]`  | `.x { display:  flex; }`  |\r\n| `[display:flex_]`  | `.x { display: flex ; }`  |\r\n| `[display:flex]`   | `.x { display: flex; }`   |\r\n\r\n### Other small improvements\r\n\r\nA few other improvements are for optimizing existing utilities:\r\n\r\n1. Remove unnecessary data types. E.g.:\r\n\r\n   - `bg-[color:red]` -> `bg-[red]`\r\n   - `shadow-[shadow:inset_0_1px_--theme(--color-white/15%)]` -> `shadow-[inset_0_1px_--theme(--color-white/15%)]`\r\n\r\n   This also makes use of these signatures and if dropping the data type results in the same signature then we can safely drop it.\r\n\r\n   Additionally, if a more specific utility exists, we will prefer that one. This reduced ambiguity and the need for data types.\r\n\r\n   - `bg-[position:123px]` → `bg-position-[123px]`\r\n   - `bg-[123px]` → `bg-position-[123px]`\r\n   - `bg-[size:123px]` → `bg-size-[123px]`\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Optimizing modifiers. E.g.:\r\n   - `bg-red-500/[25%]` → `bg-red-500/25`\r\n   - `bg-red-500/[100%]` → `bg-red-500`\r\n   - `bg-red-500/100` → `bg-red-500`\r\n\r\n3. Hoist `not` in arbitrary variants\r\n\r\n   - `[@media_not_(prefers-color-scheme:dark)]:flex` → `not-[@media_(prefers-color-scheme:dark)]:flex` → `not-dark:flex` (in case you are using the default `dark` mode implementation\r\n\r\n4. Optimize raw values that could be converted to bare values. This uses the `--spacing` variable to ensure it is safe.\r\n\r\n   - `w-[64rem]` → `w-256`\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17831","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR

[Slang](https://github.com/jeromegn/slang) is a template almost identical to slim written in Crystal.\n\nUsing the very same process used to extract CSS classes from slim templates will just work for slang templates, I'm creating this issue because nowadays I need to write my templates like `body class=\"min-h-screen\"` instead of just `body.min-h-screen`.\n\nThere was [an issue for slim templates](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17334) in the past, so I believe that just let this code also run to slang files (.slang extension) fixes that.\n\nIf I knew rust I would not even create this issue but just create a fork of tailwind and fix it on my fork just for myself since I know that the audience is really very little.\n\nThat being said, I understand if you guys don't want to fix that because no one uses slang templates, but if so can you guys just say where to tell tailwind to use the same slim/haml heuristics for files with .slang extension?\n\nThanks very much.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17851","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Tailwind v4 is not seeing classes in slang templates\"

gradient styles present in a page break Tailwind 3 gradient styles present in the same page (such as styles from a component library that has not yet upgraded to Tailwind 4), even when the TW3 styles have their own prefix and are loaded into the `components` layer.\n\nTailwind 4 changed the format of background gradient variables such as `--tw-gradient-from`. In Tailwind 3, these variables contained both a color and a percentage (e.g. `#6b7280 var(--tw-gradient-from-position)`), whereas in Tailwind 4, the variable with the same name now only contains a color value (e.g. `#6b7280`). Tailwind 4 also generates `@property` declarations that restrict these variables so that they are only allowed to contain a color value.\n\nAs a result, when a TW3-generated gradient is present in the same page as a TW4-generated gradient, the TW3-generated value for `--tw-gradient-from` will be discarded by the browser, because the TW4-generated `@property` declaration says that it's invalid.\n\nA fix for this could be to change the name of the variable in TW4 output (e.g. to `--tw-gradient-from-color`), so that the `@property` declarations from TW4 do not interfere with TW3 properties.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17845","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"TW4 @property breaks TW3 gradients used in the same page\" (#17845)"},{"Id":"3034718347","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-01T21:08:03","Actor":"Aurailus","Number":"17842","RawContent":null,"Title":"Migration to Tailwind V4: CSS Variables in `--animate-` theme variables do not resolve.","State":"closed","Body":"In Tailwind v3, I had a number of animations specified in the `extend.animation` config property that looked something like this, where CSS variables controlled the timing of the animation:\n\n`\"bob\": \"bob var(--speed, 1s) ease-in-out infinite forwards\"`\n\nWhen I migrated to Tailwind V4, I converted these to the `@theme` syntax like so:\n\n```\n@theme {\n  --animate-bob: bob var(--speed, 1s) ease-in-out infinite forwards;\n}\n```\n\nWhen I did this, the animation itself worked, but I was no longer able to control the animation by changing `--speed` on the elements that included the animation. I believe this is because the actual animation was being specified in the variable once at the top of the `theme` layer in the `:root`, and not in the `animate-bob` class itself as it was before in Tailwind V3.\n\nFor the time being, I've worked around this by simply converting my `animate-bob` class into a utility class as so:\n\n```\n@utility animate-bob {\n  animation: bob var(--speed, 1s) ease-in-out infinite forwards;\n}\n```\n\nThis works for my purposes, but as this was a kind of unexpected gotcha of the migration and I assume was an unintended regression, I thought I should bring it to your attention.\n\nI'm not actually sure how you would go about fixing this given the CSS-variable driven nature of tailwind v4. Perhaps by keeping the `--animation-*` variables around as reference for scripts / styles to reference, but copying the actual `animation` css into the `animate-*` classes instead of referencing it?

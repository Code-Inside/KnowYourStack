This allows us to skip a step where we convert our AST into a string, then parse it back into a PostCSS AST.\r\n\r\nThe only downside is that we still have to print the AST into a string if we want to optimize the CSS using Lightning CSS. Luckily this only happens in production (`NODE_ENV=production`).\r\n\r\nThis also introduces a new private `compileAst` API, that allows us to accept an AST as the input. This allows us to skip the PostCSS AST -> string -> parse into our own AST step.\r\n\r\nTo summarize:\r\n\r\nInstead of:\r\n- Input: `PostCSS AST` -> `.toString()` -> `CSS.parse(â€¦)` -> `Tailwind CSS AST`\r\n- Output: `Tailwind CSS AST` -> `toCSS(ast)` -> `postcss.parse(â€¦)` -> `PostCSS AST`\r\n\r\nWe will now do this instead:\r\n- Input: `PostCSS AST` -> `transform(â€¦)` -> `Tailwind CSS AST`\r\n- Output: `Tailwind CSS AST` -> `transform(â€¦)` -> `PostCSS AST`\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRunning this on Catalyst, the time spent in the `@tailwindcss/postcss` looks like this:\r\n- Before: median time per run: 19.407687 ms\r\n- After: median time per run: 11.8796455 ms\r\n\r\nThis is tested on Catalyst which roughly generates ~208kb worth of CSS in dev mode.\r\n\r\nWhile it's not a lot, skipping the stringification and parsing seems to improve this step by ~40%.\r\n\r\nNote: these times exclude scanning the actual candidates and only time the work needed for parsing/stringifying the CSS from and into ASTs. The actual numbers are a bit higher because of the Oxide scanner reading files from disk. But since that part is going to be there no matter what, it's not fair to include it in this benchmark.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/15297","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Use AST transformations in `@tailwindcss/postcss`\" (#15297)"},{"Id":"2717932558","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-04T14:35:39","Actor":"MonaAghili","Number":"15299","RawContent":null,"Title":"Range Input Accent Color with a Single Hex Value Not Switching Correctly Between Light and Dark Modes in Tailwind CSS","State":"closed","Body":"version of Tailwind CSS v3.4.3\r\nWe are using chrome and brave\r\nWe use Windows and MacOS\r\nWe are using `Phoenix LiveView` with `esbuild` for JavaScript bundling and asset management.\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**  \r\n[https://play.tailwindcss.com/DF91Zxjl2M](https://play.tailwindcss.com/DF91Zxjl2M)\r\n\r\n**The issue**  \r\nI have an `input` range field with a default `accent` color specified for both light and dark modes using the `accent-[color]` class.

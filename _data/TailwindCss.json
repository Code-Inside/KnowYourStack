We do this because otherwise we would have to parse a lot more CSS syntax and validate it even though it would be valid CSS in 99.99% of the cases.\r\n\r\nEven worse, if you want to use newer CSS syntax that Tailwind CSS doesn't validate yet, then you would get warnings for valid CSS.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why we don't do this is because the browser already does a great job at ignoring invalid CSS.\r\n\r\nSo the linked issue #15872 would still silently fail in development mode. In this case, everything would work, except the shadow with the invalid syntax.\r\n\r\nBut in production mode, you would now get a proper warning from Lightning CSS, because they try to optimize the CSS and remove invalid CSS.\r\n\r\nOne potential issue here is that we run Lightning CSS on the generated CSS, not on the input CSS. So the current output shows the warnings in the output CSS not the input CSS. Any thoughts if we would just skip the line numbers?\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\n1. Everything works as before\r\n2. In production mode, you would get warnings printed to the terminal.

This complements the existing mobile-first `--breakpoint-*` system by providing max-width media\r\nqueries.\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, Tailwind v4 only supports mobile-first breakpoints via --breakpoint-* variables, which generate min-width media queries. Many designers and teams prefer desktop-first workflows where styles are defined for larger\r\nscreens and then overridden for smaller devices.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly useful for:\r\n- Teams migrating from Webflow or other desktop-first CSS frameworks\r\n- Projects that start with desktop designs and adapt down to mobile\r\n- Situations where max-width queries provide cleaner, more intuitive CSS\r\n\r\nChanges\r\n\r\nImplementation\r\n\r\n- Added --max-breakpoint-* variant support in src/variants.ts\r\n- Creates static variants for each --max-breakpoint-* theme variable\r\n- Generates max-width media queries using the same format as existing max-* variants\r\n- Uses descending sort order (largest breakpoints first) for proper CSS cascade\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n\r\nDefine desktop-first breakpoints in your theme:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@theme {\r\n  --max-breakpoint-phone: 501px;\r\n  --max-breakpoint-tablet: 1001px;\r\n  --max-breakpoint-desktop: 1441px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse them with intuitive, semantic class names:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Desktop-first: starts as flex-row, becomes flex-col on phones -->\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-row phone:flex-col\">\r\n  <div>Content</div>\r\n  <div>Sidebar</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<!-- Mixed approach: combine with existing min-width breakpoints -->\r\n<div class=\"md:grid md:grid-cols-2 tablet:block phone:text-center\">\r\n  <!-- ... -->  \r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nGenerated CSS:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@media not all and (min-width: 1441px) {\r\n  .desktop\\:hidden { display: none; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media not all and (min-width: 1001px) {\r\n  .tablet\\:block { display: block; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media not all and (min-width: 501px) {\r\n  .phone\\:flex-col { flex-direction: column; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n\r\n- Semantic naming: Allow the use of meaningful breakpoint names like phone, tablet, desktop instead of size-based names\r\n- Desktop-first workflow: Define base styles for large screens, override for smaller devices\r\n- Seamless integration: Works alongside existing `--breakpoint-*` variables\r\n- Consistent behavior: Uses the same media query format and parsing logic as existing `@max-width` variants\r\n- Proper ordering: Automatically sorts breakpoints in descending order for optimal CSS cascade\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n\r\nAdded comprehensive test coverage including:\r\n- Basic functionality with custom breakpoint names\r\n- Breakpoint ordering (descending for max-width queries)\r\n- Mixed usage with existing min-width breakpoints\r\n- Edge cases and proper CSS generation\r\n\r\nAll existing tests continue to pass, ensuring no breaking changes.\r\n\r\nBackward Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis is a purely additive change that doesn't affect existing functionality:\r\n- Existing `--breakpoint-*` variables continue to work exactly as before\r\n- No changes to existing API or behavior\r\n- Can be used alongside existing breakpoint system\r\n\r\nExample Use Cases\r\n\r\nWebflow-style migration:\r\n```css\r\n@theme {\r\n  --max-breakpoint-tablet: 991px;\r\n  --max-breakpoint-mobile-landscape: 767px;\r\n  --max-breakpoint-mobile-portrait: 479px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nComponent-specific responsive design:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<nav class=\"desktop:flex desktop:justify-between tablet:block mobile:text-center\">\r\n<!-- Navigation that stacks on smaller screens -->\r\n</nav>\r\n\r\nMixed responsive strategies:\r\n<div class=\"lg:grid lg:grid-cols-3 tablet:grid tablet:grid-cols-2 mobile:block\">\r\n<!-- Hybrid approach using both min and max width breakpoints -->\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis feature provides developers with more flexibility in their responsive design workflows while maintaining Tailwind's utility-first philosophy and consistent API patterns.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18917","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add support for `--max-breakpoint-*` theme variables\" (#18917)"},{"Id":"3399155320","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-10T13:57:30","Actor":"aihowes","Number":"18906","RawContent":null,"Title":"Grid column start and end generating `grid-column:` css properties","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

We've got an [upstream bug report](https://github.com/phoenixframework/tailwind/issues/129#issuecomment-3272275554) that the app.css output does not change when editing the input app.css in a Phoenix project on Windows. I've tracked it down to the following:\n\nWhen spawning the Tailwind CLI from Elixir using this command\n\n```\nSystem.cmd(\"C:/path/to/tailwind-windows-x64.exe\", [\"--input=assets/css/app.css\", \"--output=priv/static/assets/css/app.css\", \"--watch\"], into: IO.stream(:stdio, :line))\n```\n\neverything is good. But when passing a working directory to execute the command under\n\n```\nSystem.cmd(\"C:/path/to/tailwind-windows-x64.exe\", [\"--input=assets/css/app.css\", \"--output=priv/static/assets/css/app.css\", \"--watch\"], cd: File.cwd!(), into: IO.stream(:stdio, :line))\n```\n\nthe output app.css does indeed not update.

While you can use `@variant` in normal CSS, you cannot inside of `@custom-variant`. Today this silently fails and emits invalid CSS.\r\n```css\r\n@custom-variant dark {\r\n  @variant data-dark {\r\n    @slot;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"dark:flex\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould result in:\r\n```css\r\n.dark\\:flex {\r\n  @variant data-dark {\r\n    display: flex;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo solve it we have 3 potential solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Consider it user error — but since it generates CSS and you don't really get an error you could be shipping broken CSS unknowingly.\r\n1. We could try and detect this and not generate CSS for this and potentially show a warning.\r\n1. We could make it work as expected — which is what this PR does.\r\n\r\nSome important notes:\r\n\r\n1. The evaluation of the `@custom-variant` only happens when you actually need it. That means that `@variant` inside `@custom-variant` will always have the implementation of the last definition of that variant.\r\n\r\n   In other words, if you use `@variant hover` inside a `@custom-variant`, and later you override the `hover` variant, the `@custom-variant` will use the new implementation.\r\n1. If you happen to introduce a circular dependency, then an error will be thrown during the build step.\r\n\r\nYou can consider it a bug fix or a new feature it's a bit of a gray area. But\r\none thing that is cool about this is that you can ship a plugin that looks like\r\nthis:\r\n```css\r\n@custom-variant hocus {\r\n  @variant hover {\r\n    @slot;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @variant focus {\r\n    @slot;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it will use the implementation of `hover` and `focus` that the user has defined. So if they have a custom `hover` or `focus` variant it will just work.\r\n\r\nBy default `hocus:underline` would generate:\r\n```css\r\n@media (hover: hover) {\r\n  .hocus\\:underline:hover {\r\n    text-decoration-line: underline;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n.hocus\\:underline:focus {\r\n  text-decoration-line: underline;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if you have a custom `hover` variant like:\r\n```css\r\n@custom-variant hover (&:hover);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen `hocus:underline` would generate:\r\n```css\r\n.hocus\\:underline:hover, .hocus\\:underline:focus {\r\n  text-decoration-line: underline;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Test plan\r\n\r\n1. Existing tests pass\r\n2. Added tests with this new functionality handled\r\n3. Made sure to add a test for circular dependencies + error message\r\n4.

For instance, when users copy content from a webpage into Microsoft Word, they may encounter unexpected visible lines—these stem from borders defined in the HTML. Specifically, some HTML-to-DOC conversion tools do not interpret a `border` with zero width and `solid` style (e.g., `border: 0 solid;`) as visually absent; instead, they render it as a visible border. While setting `border-style: none` can prevent this rendering artifact, it disrupts components relying on utility-first frameworks like Tailwind CSS, where border visibility is controlled exclusively via `border-width` utilities (which implicitly assume a default `border-style: solid`). This creates a conflict between document interoperability and component integrity.

The `bg-neutral-900` class does not have any effect (when served either via the Vite hot-reloading dev server or when compiled and viewed via the Vite static production preview server).\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53527c46-6eeb-486d-9a24-45612204bdf5)\n\n### Expected\n\nI expect that the `bg-neutral-900` class in the Pug Vue template would cause Tailwind to include CSS that gives that text a dark background, which is what happens if we go back to `tailwindcss` and `@tailwindcss/vite` at v4.0.9 :\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fc0a7c0-57b7-4f24-96b8-a00fce23a2d5)\n\n**Additional context:**\n\nI recently reported a similar bug for this environment (Vue templates using Pug) here: #17211. That was fixed by #17252, which was included in the Tailwind 4.0.15 release today. Although that issue was fixed, this different issue (where the presence of an HTML attribute seems to cause not all Tailwind classes to be extracted from the Pug Vue template) is present in 4.0.15.\n\nThank you for Tailwind and for taking a look at this bug!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17313","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Some Tailwind classes are not extracted from Pug templates in Vue when elements have attributes\" (#17313)"},{"Id":"2937713934","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-21T14:43:37","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"17320","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix class extraction followed by `(` in Pug","State":"closed","Body":"This PR fixes an issue where a class shorthand in Pug followed by a `(` is not properly extracted.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<template lang=\"pug\">\r\n.text-sky-600.bg-neutral-900(title=\"A tooltip\") This div has an HTML attribute.\r\n</template>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `text-sky-600` is extracted, but the `bg-neutral-900` is not.\r\n\r\nFixes: #17313\r\n\r\n# Test plan\r\n\r\n1.

The implementation was also wrong as it always set alpha to the specific percent instead of applying it additively (note that this can be fixed with `calc(alpha * opacity)` though).\r\n\r\nInstead we decided to fix this by adding a `@supports` query to Preflight that only targets browsers that aren't affected by the crash. We currently use the following workaround:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/*\r\n  Set the default placeholder color to a semi-transparent version of the current text color in browsers that do not\r\n  crash when using `color-mix(…)` with `currentColor`. (https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17194)\r\n*/\r\n\r\n@supports (not (-webkit-appearance: -apple-pay-button)) /* Not Safari */ or\r\n  (contain-intrinsic-size: 1px) /* Safari 17+ */ {\r\n  ::placeholder {\r\n    color: color-mix(in oklab, currentColor 50%, transparent);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\nWhen testing the `color-mix(currentColor)` vs `oklab(from currentColor …)` we created the following support matrix. I'm extending it with _our fix_ which is the fix ended up using:\r\n\r\n| Browser | Version | `color-mix(… currentColor …)` | `oklab(from currentColor …)` | `@supports { color-mix(…) }` |\r\n| ------- | ------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------- |\r\n| Chrome  | 111     | ❌                            | ❌                           | ❌      |\r\n| Chrome  | 116     | ✅                            | ❌                           | ✅      |\r\n| Chrome  | 131+    | ✅                            | ✅                           | ✅      |\r\n| Safari  | 16.4    | 💥                            | ❌                           | ❌       |\r\n| Safari  | 16.6+   | ✅                            | ❌                           | ❌        |\r\n| Safari  | 18+     | ✅                            | ✅                           | ✅      |\r\n| Firefox | 128     | ✅                            | ❌                           | ✅      |\r\n| Firefox | 133     | ✅                            | ✅                           | ✅      |\r\n\r\nNote that on Safari 16, this change makes it so that the browser does not crash yet it still won't work either. That's because now the browser will fall back to the default placeholder color instead.

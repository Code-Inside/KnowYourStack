In v3, variants are applied \"inside-out\".\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example a candidate like `*:first:underline` would produce the following CSS in v3:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.\\*\\:first\\:underline:first-child > * {\r\n  text-decoration-line: underline;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get the same behavior in v4, you would need to invert the candidate order to `first:*:underline`. This would generate the following CSS in v4:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:where(.first\\:\\*\\:underline:first-child > *) {\r\n  text-decoration-line: underline;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The Migration\r\n\r\nThe most naive approach would be to invert the variants for every candidate with at least two variants. This, however, runs into one issue and some unexpected inconsistencies. I have identified the following areas:\r\n\r\n1. Some pseudo class variants _must appear at the end of the selector_. v3 was patching over this by doing some manual reordering in for these variants. For example, in v3, both of these variants create the same output CSS: `hover:before:underline` and `before:hover:underline`. In v4 we simplified this system though and no longer generate the same output in both cases. Instead, you'd always want to write `hover:before:underline`, ensuring that these variants will appear at the end.\r\n   \r\n   For an exact list of which variants these affect, take a look [at this diff](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/13478/files#diff-7779a0eebf6b980dd3abd63b39729b3023cf9a31c91594f5a25ea020b066e1c0L228-L246). \r\n\r\n2. The `dark` variant and other media query variants are usually written before other variants. This is more of a recommendation to make it easier to read candidates rather than a difference in behavior as `@media` queries are hoisted by the engine. For this reason, both of these variants are _correct_ yet in real applications we prefer the first one: `lg:hover:underline`, `hover:lg:underline`. \r\n   \r\n   To avoid shuffling these rules across all candidates during the migration, we bucket `dark` and other `@media` variants into a special bucket that will not have their order changed (since people wrote stacks like `sm:max-lg:` before and we want to keep them as-is) and appear before all other variants.\r\n\r\n3. For some variant stacks, the order does not matter. E.g.: `focus:hover:underline` and `hover:focus:underline` will be the same.

This was awesome because we could compile certain Tailwind styles at runtime instead of build time.\r\n\r\nStarting with `v4.0.0-alpha.21` this is broken because of a new unguarded reference to `process.env`:\r\n\r\nhttps://app.renovatebot.com/package-diff?name=tailwindcss&from=4.0.0-alpha.20&to=4.0.0-alpha.21\r\n\r\nI'm not sure this is a bug _per se_, because I don't know if you officially support running the compiler directly in non-Node.js environments.\r\n\r\nBut… could you? Would you? Our use case doesn't require a scanner, because our classes are in pure HTML, where a regex works flawlessly; we just need the compiler to build the CSS (AFAIK the same is true for Tailwind Play).\r\n\r\nObviously we can polyfill `process` to work around this for now, but I wanted to get your POV here. It seems to me if the compiler could pass tests in both Node.js and browser environments, you'd have a pure ESM package that could run anywhere, including worker runtimes.

These are a new set of migrations that operate on files defined in the Tailwind v3 config as part of the `content` option (so your HTML, JavaScript, TSX files etc.).\r\n\r\nThe migration for this is integrated in the new `@tailwindcss/upgrade` package and will require pointing the migration to an input JavaScript config file, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpx @tailwindcss/upgrade --config tailwind.config.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea of template migrations is to apply breaking changes from the v3 to v4 migration within your template files.\r\n\r\n## Migrating !important syntax\r\n\r\nThe first migration that I’m adding with this PR is to ensure we use the v4 important syntax that has the exclamation mark at the end of the utility. \r\n\r\nFor example, this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"!flex sm:!block\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill now turn into:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"flex! sm:block!\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Architecture considerations\r\n\r\nImplementation wise, we make use of Oxide to scan the content files fast and efficiently. By relying on the same scanner als Tailwind v4, we guarantee that all candidates that are part of the v4 output will have gone through a migration. \r\n\r\nMigrations itself operate on the abstract `Candidate` type, similar to the type we use in the v4 codebase. It will parse the candidate into its parts so they can easily be introspected/modified. Migrations are typed as:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntype TemplateMigration = (candidate: Candidate) => Candidate | null\r\n``` \r\n\r\n`null` should be returned if the `Candidate` does not need a migration. \r\n\r\nWe currently use the v4 `parseCandidate` function to get an abstract definition of the candidate rule that we can operate on. _This will likely need to change in the future as we need to fork `parseCandidate` for v3 specific syntax_. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we're inlining a `printCandidate` function that can stringify the abstract `Candidate` type. It is not guaranteed that this is an identity function since some information can be lost during the parse step. This is not a problem though, because migrations will only run selectively and if none of the selectors trigger, the candidates are not updated. h/t to @RobinMalfait for providing the printer.\r\n\r\nSo the overall flow of a migration looks like this:\r\n\r\n- Scan the config file for `content` files\r\n- Use Oxide to extract a list of candidate and their positions from these `content` files\r\n- Run a few migrations that operate on the `Candidate` abstract type.\r\n- Print the updated `Candidate` back into the original `content` file.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14502","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add setup for template migrations\" (#14502)"},{"Id":"2543819364","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-25T14:06:37","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"14501","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add support for prefixes","State":"closed","Body":"This PR adds support for requiring a custom prefix on utility classes.\r\n\r\nPrefixes work a bit differently in v4 than they did in v3:\r\n- They look like a custom variant: `tw:bg-white`\r\n- It is always first in a utility — even before other variants: `tw:hover:bg-white`\r\n- It is required on **all** utility classes — even arbitrary properties: `tw:[color:red]`\r\n- Prefixes also apply to generated CSS variables which will be separated by a dash: `--tw-color-white: #fff;`\r\n- Only alpha (a-z) characters are allowed in a prefix — so no `#tw#` or `__` or similar prefixes are allowed\r\n\r\nTo configure a prefix you can use add `prefix(tw)` to your theme or when importing Tailwind CSS like so:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/* when importing `tailwindcss` */\r\n@import 'tailwindcss' prefix(tw);\r\n\r\n/* when importing the theme separately */\r\n@import 'tailwindcss/theme' prefix(tw);\r\n\r\n/* or when using an entirely custom theme */\r\n@theme prefix(tw) {\r\n  --color-white: #fff;\r\n  --breakpoint-sm: 640px;\r\n  /* … */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will configure Tailwind CSS to require a prefix on all utility classes when used in HTML:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"tw:bg-white tw:p-4\">\r\n  This will have a white background and 4 units of padding.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bg-white p-4\">\r\n  This will not because the prefix is missing.\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand when used in CSS via `@apply`:\r\n```css\r\n.my-class {\r\n  @apply tw:bg-white tw:p-4;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the prefix will be added to the generated CSS variables.

I really love using it.\r\n\r\nWhile diagnosing performance problems on a closed-source app I develop, I realized that `@base` is adding a host of css variables to the `*` selector. I'm confused why it's targeted this way instead of [:root](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root#examples).\r\n\r\nI *think* targeting `*` is an issue for css variables in particular because it appears to redefine the variable at every single node. That's why when inspecting any element on the page and looking at the variable definitions, you'll often see dozens of overriden definitions. Not only is this noisy, but I've measured a significant performance impact to `Recalculate Styles` in Chrome Devtools.\r\n\r\n*Performance impact details*\r\n\r\nIt's likely a different level of impact for every app, but I'm measuring around a ~2.5x hit to Recalculate Styles on Tailwind Play. The closed-source app I develop involves a page with a supidly large number of DOM elements and has a larger impact. It likely scales with the depth of nodes. See the attached screenshots for traces I took on Tailwind Play with the css vars applied to `*` vs. `:root`.\r\n\r\n\r\n| * selector  |  :root selector |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| 5.18ms  | 1.96ms |\r\n\r\nRepro steps: do the below steps for both default and after modifying the css var initialization selector to `:root`.\r\n1. Go to https://play.tailwindcss.com/.\r\n2. Click the \"Preview only\" button.\r\n3. Now start a performance trace and click the \"Vertical Split\" option.\r\n4. Stop the trace and examine \"Recalculate Styles\".\r\n\r\n*Applied to star (current behavior)*\r\n<img width=\"1919\" alt=\"applied-to-star\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03805a34-b6cf-4772-8930-7b2022016bf1\">\r\n\r\n\r\n*Applied to root*\r\n<img width=\"1920\" alt=\"applied-to-root\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d52e1255-a373-44b4-aa79-aa9aae2906e9\">\r\n\r\n*Request for advice*\r\n\r\nI'm considering manually injecting the required css variables to `:root` to solve these issues instead of using `@base`.\r\nDo y'all think that's an ok workaround?

The simple color classes generated are missing the opacity properties like `var(--tw-bg-opacity)` and `var(--tw-text-opacity)` — it seems that Tailwind just copies the value directly.\r\n2. Tailwind completely fails to generate modified-opacity classes for these colors, like `bg-primary/50`.\r\n\r\nThe same problems occur if I explicitly declare an opacity in the color definition: `primary: \"oklch(68% 0.15 237.33 / 1)\"`.\r\n\r\nClasses _ARE_ generated correctly if I use the `<alpha-value>` placeholder in color definitions: `primary: \"oklch(68% 0.15 237.33 / <alpha-value>)\"`. **However, this magic is not explained anywhere in Tailwind's color documentation:** https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors\r\n\r\nThe playground link shows both issues and contrasts the correct behavior of colors defined using `rgb(r g b / a)` notation.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/14499","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"oklch color definitions don't work with color/opacity syntax — classes missing or incomplete\" (#14499)"},{"Id":"2543355210","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-23T19:45:01","Actor":"Daniel777y","Number":"14497","RawContent":null,"Title":"Background gradient `bg-gradient` display error","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\nFor example: v3.4.1\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\npostcss8, Next.js 14.2.5\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\nv20.10.0\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\n\r\nChrome, Safari\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\n\r\nmacOS, Windows, iOS, Android\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\n\r\nWe did see this issue once on some scenarios, but we can't reproduce it consistently.

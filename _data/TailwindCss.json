To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create an issue to first discuss any significant new features. This includes things like adding new utilities, creating new at-rules, or adding new component examples to the documentation.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\n-->\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17834","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Create devcontainer.json\" (#17834)"},{"Id":"3031593630","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-30T15:09:17","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"17831","RawContent":null,"Title":"Design system driven upgrade migrations","State":"open","Body":"This PR introduces a vastly improved upgrade migrations system, to migrate your codebase and modernize your utilities to make use of the latest variants and utilities.\r\n\r\nIt all started when I saw this PR the other day: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17790 \r\n\r\nI was about to comment \"Don't forget to add a migration\". But I've been thinking about a system where we can automate this process away. This PR introduces this system.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces upgrade migrations based on the internal Design System, and it mainly updates arbitrary variants, arbitrary properties and arbitrary values.\r\n\r\n## The problem\r\n\r\nWhenever we ship new utilities, or you make changes to your CSS file by introducing new `@theme` values, or adding new `@utility` rules. It could be that the rest of your codebase isn't aware of that, but you could be using these values.\r\n\r\nFor example, it could be that you have a lot of arbitrary properties in your codebase, they look something like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"[color-scheme:dark] [text-wrap:balance]\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever we introduce new features in Tailwind CSS, you probably don't keep an eye on the release notes and update all of these arbitrary properties to the newly introduced utilities.\r\n\r\nBut with this PR, we can run the upgrade tool:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nnpx -y @tailwindcss/upgrade@latest\r\n```\r\n\r\n...and it will upgrade your project to use the new utilities:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"scheme-dark text-balance\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt also works for arbitrary values, for example imagine you have classes like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Arbitrary property -->\r\n<div class=\"[max-height:1lh]\"></div>\r\n\r\n<!-- Arbitrary value -->\r\n<div class=\"max-h-[1lh]\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning the upgrade tool again:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nnpx -y @tailwindcss/upgrade@latest\r\n```\r\n\r\n... gives you the following output:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Arbitrary property -->\r\n<div class=\"max-h-lh\"></div>\r\n\r\n<!-- Arbitrary value -->\r\n<div class=\"max-h-lh\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because of the original PR I mentioned, which introduced the `max-h-lh` utilities.\r\n\r\nA nice benefit is that this output only has 1 unique class instead of 2, which also potentially reduces the size of your CSS file.\r\n\r\nIt could also be that you are using arbitrary values where you (or a team member) didn't even know an alternative solution existed.\r\n\r\nE.g.:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"w-[48rem]\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter running the upgrade tool you will get this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"w-3xl\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can go further though. Since the release of Tailwind CSS v4, we introduced the concept of \"bare values\". Essentially allowing you to type a number on utilities where it makes sense, and we produce a value based on that number.\r\n\r\nSo an input like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"border-[123px]\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill be optimized to just:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"border-123\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be very useful for complex utilities, for example, how many times have you written something like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"grid-cols-[repeat(16,minmax(0,1fr))]\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause up until Tailwind CSS v4, we only generated 12 columns by default. But since v4, we can generate any number of columns automatically.\r\n\r\nRunning the migration tool will give you this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"grid-cols-16\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### User CSS\r\n\r\nBut, what if I told you that we can keep going...\r\n\r\nIn [Catalyst](https://tailwindcss.com/plus/ui-kit) we often use classes that look like this for accessibility reasons:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"text-[CanvasText] bg-[Highlight]\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat if you want to move the `CanvasText` and `Highlight` colors to your CSS:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@import \"tailwincdss\";\r\n\r\n@theme {\r\n  --color-canvas: CanvasText;\r\n  --color-highlight: Highlight;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you now run the upgrade tool again, this will be the result:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"text-canvas bg-highlight\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe never shipped a `text-canvas` or `bg-highlight` utility, but the upgrade tool uses your own CSS configuration to migrate your codebase.\r\n\r\nThis will keep your codebase clean, consistent and modern and you are in control.\r\n\r\nLet's look at one more example, what if you have this in a lot of places:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"[scrollbar-gutter:stable]\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you don't want to wait for the Tailwind CSS team to ship a `scrollbar-stable` (or similar) feature. You can add your own utility:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@import \"tailwincdss\";\r\n\r\n@utility scrollbar-stable {\r\n  scrollbar-gutter: stable;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"scrollbar-stable\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The solution — how it works\r\n\r\nThere are 2 big things happening here:\r\n\r\n1. Instead of us (the Tailwind CSS team) hardcoding certain migrations, we will make use of the internal `DesignSystem` which is the source of truth for all this information. This is also what Tailwind CSS itself uses to generate the CSS file.\r\n\r\n   The internal `DesignSystem` is essentially a list of all:\r\n\r\n   1. The internal utilities\r\n   2. The internal variants\r\n   3. The default theme we ship\r\n   4. The user CSS\r\n      1. With custom `@theme` values\r\n      2. With custom `@custom-variant` implementations\r\n      3. With custom `@utility` implementations\r\n2. The upgrade tool now has a concept of `signatures`\r\n\r\nThe signatures part is the most interesting one, and it allows us to be 100% sure that we can migrate your codebase without breaking anything.\r\n\r\nA signature is some unique identifier that represents a utility. But 2 utilities that do the exact same thing will have the same signature.\r\n\r\nTo make this work, we have to make sure that we normalize values. One such value is the selector. I think a little visualization will help here:\r\n\r\n| UTILITY          | GENERATED SIGNATURE     |\r\n| ---------------- | ----------------------- |\r\n| `[display:flex]` | `.x { display: flex; }` |\r\n| `flex`           | `.x { display: flex; }` |\r\n\r\nThey have the exact same signature and therefore the upgrade tool can safely migrate them to the same utility.\r\n\r\nFor this we will prefer the following order:\r\n\r\n1. Static utilities — essentially no brackets. E.g.: `flex`, `grid-cols-2`\r\n2. Arbitrary values — e.g.: `max-h-[1lh]`, `border-[2px]`\r\n3. Arbitrary properties — e.g.: `[color-scheme:dark]`, `[display:flex]`\r\n\r\nWe also have to canonicalize utilities to there minimal form. Essentially making sure we increase the chance of finding a match.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[display:_flex_] → [display:flex] → flex\r\n[display:_flex]  → [display:flex] → flex\r\n[display:flex_]  → [display:flex] → flex\r\n[display:flex]   → [display:flex] → flex\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we don't do this, then the signatures will be slightly different, due to the whitespace:\r\n\r\n| UTILITY            | GENERATED SIGNATURE       |\r\n| ------------------ | ------------------------- |\r\n| `[display:_flex_]` | `.x { display:  flex ; }` |\r\n| `[display:_flex]`  | `.x { display:  flex; }`  |\r\n| `[display:flex_]`  | `.x { display: flex ; }`  |\r\n| `[display:flex]`   | `.x { display: flex; }`   |\r\n\r\n### Other small improvements\r\n\r\nA few other improvements are for optimizing existing utilities:\r\n\r\n1. Remove unnecessary data types. E.g.:\r\n\r\n   - `bg-[color:red]` -> `bg-[red]`\r\n   - `shadow-[shadow:inset_0_1px_--theme(--color-white/15%)]` -> `shadow-[inset_0_1px_--theme(--color-white/15%)]`\r\n\r\n   This also makes use of these signatures and if dropping the data type results in the same signature then we can safely drop it.\r\n\r\n   Additionally, if a more specific utility exists, we will prefer that one. This reduced ambiguity and the need for data types.\r\n\r\n   - `bg-[position:123px]` → `bg-position-[123px]`\r\n   - `bg-[123px]` → `bg-position-[123px]`\r\n   - `bg-[size:123px]` → `bg-size-[123px]`\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Optimizing modifiers. E.g.:\r\n   - `bg-red-500/[25%]` -> `bg-red-500/25`\r\n   - `bg-red-500/[100%]` -> `bg-red-500`\r\n   - `bg-red-500/100` -> `bg-red-500`\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17831","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Design system driven upgrade migrations\" (#17831)"},{"Id":"3031156546","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-30T14:57:45","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"17830","RawContent":null,"Title":"Prepare v4.1.5 release","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17830","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Prepare v4.1.5 release\" (#17830)"},{"Id":"3025446203","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-30T12:30:59","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"17812","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add discrete properties to the default list of `transition` properties","State":"closed","Body":"This PR changes the `transition` utility to include five new properties:\r\n\r\n- `display`\r\n- `visibility`\r\n- `content-visibility`\r\n- `overlay`\r\n- `pointer-eventes`\r\n\r\nOn its own, this change does nothing since these properties will apply their change _immediately_.

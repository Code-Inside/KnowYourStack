This is especially important as I use Angular Material, which forces their styles into the `<head>` earlier than application styles causing them to always win in a priority competition, and this behaviour cannot be changed.\n\nImportant being forced on `@apply` rules messes with complex custom classes (if you've ever tried to customise the browser's built-in slider input, you'll understand my pain), wherein instead of having my class reference a CSS variable and have that variable have sensible defaults that can simply be overridden with an inline style, i.e. \n```css\n// slider.css\n// exerpt from a much large class that has to separately handle mozilla and webkit, because sliders SUCK\n.slider {\n    // Mozilla track gradient (simulates a \"filling\" bar)\n        @apply [&::-moz-range-track]:bg-linear-to-r [&::-moz-range-track]:from-(--left-bar) [&::-moz-range-track]:via-(--right-bar) [&::-moz-range-track]:to-(--right-bar);\n        // Mozilla track value setter (allows 1 variable to control both pats of the fill)\n        @apply [&::-moz-range-track]:from-(percentage:--value) [&::-moz-range-track]:via-(percentage:--value) [&::-moz-range-track]:to-100%;\n}\n```\n\n```html\n// some-component.html\n<input type=\"range\" max=\"100\" class=\"slider\" [style.--value.%]=\"value\"  [value]=\"value\" />\n```\n\nWith v4 now I am forced to set the variable with `!important` in order to override the default value I have set at 50%\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18400","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Using important automatically applies it to utilites set via @apply in v4\" (#18400)"},{"Id":"3183057114","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-27T15:55:15","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"18404","RawContent":null,"Title":"Don't consider the global important state in `@apply`","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #18400\r\n\r\nIn v3 when you used `important: true` it did not affect `@apply`. However, in v4 it does and there's no way to make it *not*. This is definitely a bug and would be unexpected for users coming from v3 who use `@apply` and `important` together.\r\n\r\nBasically, the following code, along with the detected utility `flex` in source files…\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@import 'tailwindcss/utilities' important;\r\n.flex-explicitly-important {\r\n  @apply flex!;\r\n}\r\n.flex-not-important {\r\n  @apply flex;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n… would output this:\r\n```css\r\n.flex {\r\n  display: flex !important;\r\n}\r\n.flex-explicitly-important  {\r\n  display: flex !important;\r\n}\r\n.flex-not-important {\r\n  display: flex !important;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it's expected that `@apply` doesn't consider the \"global\" important state. This PR addresss this problem and now the output is this:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.flex {\r\n  display: flex !important;\r\n}\r\n.flex-explicitly-important  {\r\n  display: flex !important;\r\n}\r\n.flex-not-important {\r\n  display: flex; /* this line changed */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to mark a utility as important in `@apply` you can still use `!` after the utility to do so as shown above.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18404","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Don't consider the global important state in `@apply`\" (#18404)"},{"Id":"3182559452","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-27T13:28:05","Actor":"indcoder","Number":"18403","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug: Regression in grid component after upgrade to Tailwind v4","State":"closed","Body":"\n**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\n4.1.10\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nDaisy v5\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\n23.1.0\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nChrome, Edge, Firefox\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nWindows 11, WSL \n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\nhttps://github.com/HackerspaceMumbai/Visage\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nI upgraded Daisy to v5 from v3.

The issue occurs with custom variants (like my implementation of `focus-visible`) as well as built-in variants like `hover:`.\n\n\nIntelliSense's hover preview does get it right though:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8ecb265-c5ff-46c7-95c6-7ad6d4fac34e)\n\n## Expected behavior\nBoth ordering approaches should work and apply the styles correctly, regardless of whether the variant is placed before or after the arbitrary selector.\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18387","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Modifier order issue: variants before arbitrary not selectors fail to apply styles\" (#18387)"},{"Id":"3171399247","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-24T16:50:31","Actor":"ekko2665","Number":"18379","RawContent":null,"Title":"tailwindCSS not being  work in some android mobile","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

While we understand these are precompiled performance tools, some transparency or build options would help dev teams avoid security flagging on production servers.\n\nWhen deploying a Laravel 11 project using Tailwind CSS (via @tailwindcss/oxide) on a production server running ImunifyAV malware scanning, several files in the node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-* directories are repeatedly flagged as malware.\n\nThe affected files are native .node binaries such as: \n\n```node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu/oxide.linux-x64-gnu.node```\n```node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-musl/oxide.linux-x64-musl.node```\n\n---\n\n ```httpdocs/node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-musl/tailwindcss-oxide.linux-x64-musl.node```\n ```httpdocs/node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu/tailwindcss-oxide.linux-x64-gnu.node```\n```httpdocs/node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu/oxide.linux-x64-gnu.node```\n```httpdocs/node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-musl/oxide.linux-x64-musl.node```\n```httpdocs/node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-musl/tailwindcss-oxide.linux-x64-musl.node```\n```httpdocs/node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu/tailwindcss-oxide.linux-x64-gnu.node```\n```httpdocs/node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-musl/oxide.linux-x64-musl.node```\n\n---\n\n🧨 Problem Summary\n\nThis isn’t just an issue with Tailwind’s JIT binaries (oxide). Rollup — the JavaScript bundler that many frontend frameworks use (including Vite, which Laravel 11 defaults to) — is also shipping native .node binaries that are being flagged as malware by ImunifyAV.\n\n---\n\n**My Concerns**\n\nDoes this make any websites that use this tailwind library to become vulnerable?  ImunifyAV is saying they contain malware. Is it a false positive? On my side I ran the scan about 8 times and it came back with the same thing each time. I have always used tailwind and it would be ashame to have to move away from it due to these security issues. \n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18366","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"According to imunifyAV this may contain malware\" (#18366)"},{"Id":"3164470054","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-21T19:40:11","Actor":"kilavvy","Number":"18361","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix: Correct typo in comment","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request contains a couple of minor documentation fixes.\r\n\r\n- Corrected a typo from `predicable` to `predictable` in a comment for `DarkModeStrategy`.\r\n- Applied minor formatting to a comment in a test file.\r\n\r\nThese changes help improve code clarity and maintainability.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18361","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix: Correct typo in comment\" (#18361)"},{"Id":"3165166324","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-21T15:37:51","Actor":"danielehrhardt","Number":"18363","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support Angular Scss with Tailwind 4","State":"closed","Body":"Support Angular Scss with Tailwind 4","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18363","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Support Angular Scss with Tailwind 4\" (#18363)"},{"Id":"3164028882","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-20T18:03:07","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"18360","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update eslint 9.27.0 → 9.29.0 (minor)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

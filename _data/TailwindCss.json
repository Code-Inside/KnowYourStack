Basically all of these steps already existed in the upgrade tool, but are now moved to our core `tailwindcss` package.\r\n\r\nHere is a list of all the changes:\r\n- Added a new `canonicalizeCandidates` function to the design system\r\n- Moved various migration steps to the core package. I inlined them in the same file and because of that I noticed a specific pattern (more on this later).\r\n- Moved `printCandidate` tests to the `tailwindcss` package\r\n- Setup tests for `canonicalizeCandidates` based on the existing tests in the upgrade tool.\r\n\r\nI noticed that all the migrations followed a specific pattern:\r\n\r\n1. Parse the raw candidate into a `Candidate[]` AST\r\n2. In a loop, try to migrate the `Candidate` to a new `Candidate` (this often handled both the `Candidate` and its `Variant[]`)\r\n3. If something changed, print the new `Candidate` back to a string, and pass it to the next migration step.\r\n\r\nWhile this makes sense in isolation, we are doing a lot of repeated work by parsing, modifying, and printing the candidate multiple times. This let me to introduce the `big refactor` commit. This changes the steps to:\r\n\r\n1. Up front, parse the raw candidate into a `Candidate[]` _once_.\r\n2. Strip the variants and the important marker from the candidate. This means that each migration step only has to deal with the base `utility` and not care about the variants or the important marker. We can re-attach these afterwards.\r\n3. Instead of a `rawCandidate: string`, each migration step receives an actual `Candidate` object (or a `Variant` object).\r\n4. I also split up the migration steps for the `Candidate` and the `Variant[]`.\r\n\r\nAll of this means that there is a lot less work that needs to be done. We can also cache results between migrations. So `[@media_print]:flex` and `[@media_print]:block` will result in `print:flex` and `print:block` respectively, but the `[@media_print]` part is only migrated once across both candidates.\r\n\r\nOne migration step relied on the `postcss-selector-parser` package to parse selectors and attribute selectors. I didn't want to introduce a package just for this, so instead used our own `SelectorParser` in the migration and wrote a small `AttributeSelectorParser` that can parse the attribute selector into a little data structure we can work with instead.\r\n\r\nIf we want, we can split this PR up into smaller pieces, but since the biggest chunk is moving existing code around, I think it's fairly doable to review as long as you go commit by commit.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWith this new API, we can turn:\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  'bg-red-500',\r\n  'hover:bg-red-500',\r\n  '[@media_print]:bg-red-500',\r\n  'hover:[@media_print]:bg-red-500',\r\n  'bg-red-500/100',\r\n  'hover:bg-red-500/100',\r\n  '[@media_print]:bg-red-500/100',\r\n  'hover:[@media_print]:bg-red-500/100',\r\n  'bg-[var(--color-red-500)]',\r\n  'hover:bg-[var(--color-red-500)]',\r\n  '[@media_print]:bg-[var(--color-red-500)]',\r\n  'hover:[@media_print]:bg-[var(--color-red-500)]',\r\n  'bg-[var(--color-red-500)]/100',\r\n  'hover:bg-[var(--color-red-500)]/100',\r\n  '[@media_print]:bg-[var(--color-red-500)]/100',\r\n  'hover:[@media_print]:bg-[var(--color-red-500)]/100',\r\n  'bg-(--color-red-500)',\r\n  'hover:bg-(--color-red-500)',\r\n  '[@media_print]:bg-(--color-red-500)',\r\n  'hover:[@media_print]:bg-(--color-red-500)',\r\n  'bg-(--color-red-500)/100',\r\n  'hover:bg-(--color-red-500)/100',\r\n  '[@media_print]:bg-(--color-red-500)/100',\r\n  'hover:[@media_print]:bg-(--color-red-500)/100',\r\n  'bg-[color:var(--color-red-500)]',\r\n  'hover:bg-[color:var(--color-red-500)]',\r\n  '[@media_print]:bg-[color:var(--color-red-500)]',\r\n  'hover:[@media_print]:bg-[color:var(--color-red-500)]',\r\n  'bg-[color:var(--color-red-500)]/100',\r\n  'hover:bg-[color:var(--color-red-500)]/100',\r\n  '[@media_print]:bg-[color:var(--color-red-500)]/100',\r\n  'hover:[@media_print]:bg-[color:var(--color-red-500)]/100',\r\n  'bg-(color:--color-red-500)',\r\n  'hover:bg-(color:--color-red-500)',\r\n  '[@media_print]:bg-(color:--color-red-500)',\r\n  'hover:[@media_print]:bg-(color:--color-red-500)',\r\n  'bg-(color:--color-red-500)/100',\r\n  'hover:bg-(color:--color-red-500)/100',\r\n  '[@media_print]:bg-(color:--color-red-500)/100',\r\n  'hover:[@media_print]:bg-(color:--color-red-500)/100',\r\n  '[background-color:var(--color-red-500)]',\r\n  'hover:[background-color:var(--color-red-500)]',\r\n  '[@media_print]:[background-color:var(--color-red-500)]',\r\n  'hover:[@media_print]:[background-color:var(--color-red-500)]',\r\n  '[background-color:var(--color-red-500)]/100',\r\n  'hover:[background-color:var(--color-red-500)]/100',\r\n  '[@media_print]:[background-color:var(--color-red-500)]/100',\r\n  'hover:[@media_print]:[background-color:var(--color-red-500)]/100'\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nInto their canonicalized form:\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  'bg-red-500',\r\n  'hover:bg-red-500',\r\n  'print:bg-red-500',\r\n  'hover:print:bg-red-500'\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe list is also unique, so we won't end up with `bg-red-500 bg-red-500` twice.\r\n\r\nWhile the canonicalization itself is fairly fast, we still pay a **~1s** startup cost for some migrations (once, and cached for the entire lifetime of the design system). I would like to keep improving the performance and the kinds of migrations we do, but I think this is a good start.\r\n\r\nThe cost we pay is for:\r\n\r\n1. Generating a full list of all possible utilities based on the `getClassList` suggestions API.\r\n2. Generating a full list of all possible variants.\r\n\r\nThe canonicalization step for this list takes **~2.9ms** on my machine.\r\n\r\nJust for fun, if you use the `getClassList` API for intellisense that generates all the suggestions and their modifiers, you get a list of **263788** classes. If you canonicalize all of these, it takes **~500ms** in total. So roughly **~1.9μs** per candidate.\r\n\r\nThis new API doesn't result in a performance difference for normal Tailwind CSS builds.\r\n\r\nThe other potential concern is file size of the package. The generated `tailwindcss.tgz` file changed like this:\r\n```diff\r\n- 684652 bytes (684.65 kB)\r\n+ 749169 bytes (749.17 kB)\r\n```\r\nSo the package increased by ~65 kB which I don't think is the end of the world, but it is important for the `@tailwindcss/browser` build which we don't want to grow unnecessarily. For this reason we remove some of the code for the design system conditionally such that you don't pay this cost in an environment where you will never need this API.\r\n\r\nThe `@tailwindcss/browser` build looks like this:\r\n```shell\r\n`dist/index.global.js 255.14 KB` (main)\r\n`dist/index.global.js 272.61 KB` (before this change)\r\n`dist/index.global.js 252.83 KB` (after this change, even smaller than on `main`)\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/19059","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Introduce `canonicalizeCandidates` on the internal Design System\" (#19059)"},{"Id":"3485575018","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-06T09:14:32","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"19056","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update globby 14.1.0 → 15.0.0 (major)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this upgrade.

This was working correctly in v4.1.13 and earlier versions.\n\n**Steps to reproduce:**\n\n1. Create a Svelte component library using `svelte-package`\n2. Define custom theme utilities in a main CSS file using `@theme`:\n   ```css\n   @theme {\n     --radius-button: var(--theme-radius-button, var(--theme-radius, var(--radius-md, 0)));\n   }\n   ```\n3. Use `@reference` directive in component styles to import the theme:\n   ```css\n   <style lang=\"postcss\">\n     @reference \"@layerd/ui/ui.css\";\n     .btn {\n       @apply rounded-button; /* Custom utility from theme */\n     }\n   </style>\n   ```\n4. Run `svelte-package` build\n\n**Expected behavior:**\nThe build should complete successfully with custom theme utilities being resolved through the `@reference` directive.\n\n**Actual behavior:**\nSince v4.1.14, the build fails with errors like:\n```\nCannot apply unknown utility class `rounded-button`. Are you using CSS modules or similar and missing `@reference`?\n```\n\n**Additional context:**\n- This appears to be a regression introduced in v4.1.14\n- Downgrading to v4.1.13 resolves the issue\n- The problem specifically affects complex monorepo setups where components reference a main CSS file with custom theme utilities\n- The `@reference` directive seems to not properly resolve theme variables during the `svelte-package` build process in v4.1.14\n\n**Workaround:**\nDowngrade to Tailwind CSS v4.1.13:\n```json\n{\n  \"@tailwindcss/cli\": \"4.1.13\",\n  \"@tailwindcss/postcss\": \"4.1.13\", \n  \"@tailwindcss/vite\": \"4.1.13\",\n  \"tailwindcss\": \"4.1.13\"\n}\n```","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/19051","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`@reference` directive fails to resolve custom theme utilities in svelte builds since v4.1.14\" (#19051)"},{"Id":"3481823727","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-03T17:26:20","Actor":"DevBasem","Number":"19050","RawContent":null,"Title":"classes like \"lg:ms-4\" and \"lg:ps-4\" not working in dev mode on a brand new nextjs project","State":"closed","Body":"Nextjs: 15.5.4\nTailwind 4\n\n**issue description**\nas the title says, logical tailwind classes doesn't work with breakpoint utilities this only happens in dev mode, in production the classes work fine, is there any fix or work around for this.\n\n**reproduction**\nsetup a new Nextjs project and try out in the home page using the app router","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/19050","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"classes like \"lg:ms-4\" and \"lg:ps-4\" not working in dev mode on a brand new nextjs project\" (#19050)"},{"Id":"3481442545","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-03T16:35:07","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"19049","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update eslint 9.35.0 → 9.36.0 (minor)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

How does your change solve the problem?\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### 1. Handling React className migration\r\n\r\nThe PR fixes an issue when migrating React components to tailwind v4 with the migration tool, that the first class after `className=\"` is ignored.\r\n\r\nFor example, when migrating\r\n```JSX\r\n<div className=\"shadow\"></div>\r\n```\r\n`shadow` will not be migrated to `shadow-sm` .\r\n\r\nThis is because in `is-safe-migration.ts`, it tests the line before candidate with regex `/(?<!:?class)=['\"]$/`. This basically skips the migration for anything like `foo=\"shadow\"`, with only exception for Vue (eg. `class=\"shadow\"`).\r\n\r\nThe PR changes the regex from\r\n\r\n```regex\r\n/(?<!:?class)=['\"]$/\r\n````\r\nto\r\n```regex\r\n/(?<!:?class|className)=['\"]$/\r\n```\r\nwhich essentially adds a new exception specifically for React's `className=\"shadow\"` case.\r\n\r\n### 2. Removing redundant rules\r\n\r\nBesides, I found that several other rules in `CONDITIONAL_TEMPLATE_SYNTAX` being redundant since they are already covered by the rule above, so I removed them. If we prefer the previous explicit approach, I can revert it.\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nExplain how you tested your changes. Include the exact commands that you used to verify the change works and include screenshots/screen recordings of the update behavior in the browser if applicable.\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTests added for both the Vue and React classes to prevent false negative cases.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/19031","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Ensure first class inside className in React is migrated\" (#19031)"},{"Id":"3469765453","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-30T14:24:10","Actor":"alex-buena","Number":"19032","RawContent":null,"Title":"variants not working with prefix \\ how to do dark mode with prefix","State":"open","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\nv4.1.13\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\n```\"vite\": \"^7.1.7\"```\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nbun 1.2.22\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nChrome\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nmacOS\n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\nhttps://play.tailwindcss.com/hdK4SMZs1n?file=css\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nTailwind does not prefix the variables in the ```@variant``` section.

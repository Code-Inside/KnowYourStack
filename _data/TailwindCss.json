Specifically, this version attempts to:\r\n\r\n- Allow migrations to access the raw candidate. This way we can migrate candidates that _would not parse as valid in v4_. This will help us migrate prefixes in candidates from v3 to v4.\r\n- There is no more awkward \"return null\" if nothing has changed. The return `null` was necessary because we relied on mutating the Variant and since parsing/printing could remove some information, it was not easy to find out wether a candidate needed to be migrated at all. With a string though, we can do this cheaply by returning the `rawCandidate`.\r\n- We previously asserted that if `parseCandidate` returns more than one candidate, we only picked the first one. This behavior is now moved into the migrations where we have more context. For now though, we still do not need to worry about this since in all cases, these duplicate candidates would serialize to the same `Candidate`. It is helpful if you only want to run a migration on a specific type of candidate (e.g. if there's a `static` one and a more generic `functional` one).  \r\n- We need access to the `DesignSystem` inside migrations now to be able to `parseCandidate`s.\r\n\r\nOpening this up as a separate PR since it can take some time to iron out the edge cases for the individual codemod PRs and I don't want to be rebasing all the time. \r\n\r\n## Before\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntype Migration = (candidate: Candidate) => Candidate | null\r\n```\r\n\r\n## After\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntype Migration = (designSystem: DesignSystem, rawCandidate: string) => string\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14539","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update template migration interface\" (#14539)"},{"Id":"2553171158","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-27T15:22:00","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"14538","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add the bg-gradient migration to the default list of template migrations","State":"closed","Body":"Quick follow-up from #14537 as I forgot to add the new migration to the default list of migrations.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14538","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add the bg-gradient migration to the default list of template migrations\" (#14538)"},{"Id":"2553106893","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-27T14:52:57","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"14537","RawContent":null,"Title":"Template migrations: Migrate `bg-gradient-*` utilities to `bg-linear-*`","State":"closed","Body":"In v4, we're making room for more gradient primitives with the addition of [gradient and conic gradient utilities](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14467).

We did this by adding the `@import` to the top of the file.\r\n\r\nWhile this is correct, this means that the diff might not be as clear. For example, if you have a situation where you have a license comment:\r\n```css\r\n/**! My license comment */\r\n@tailwind base;\r\n@tailwind components;\r\n@tailwind utilities;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis resulted in:\r\n```css\r\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\r\n/**! My license comment */\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile it is not wrong, it feels weird that this behaves like this. In this commit we make sure that it is injected in-place (the first `@tailwind` at-rule we find) and fixup the position if we can't inject it in-place.\r\n\r\nThe above example results in this:\r\n```css\r\n/**! My license comment */\r\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, there are scenario's where you can't replace the `@tailwind` directives directly. E.g.:\r\n```css\r\n/**! My license comment */\r\nhtml {\r\n  color: red;\r\n}\r\n@tailwind base;\r\n@tailwind components;\r\n@tailwind utilities;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we replace the `@tailwind` directives in-place, it would look like this:\r\n```css\r\n/**! My license comment */\r\nhtml {\r\n  color: red;\r\n}\r\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this is invalid CSS, because you can't have CSS above an `@import` at-rule. There are some exceptions like:\r\n- `@charset`\r\n- `@import`\r\n- `@layer foo, bar;` (just the order, without a body)\r\n- comments\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, we inject the import in the nearest place where it is allowed to. In this case:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/**! My license comment */\r\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\r\n@layer base {\r\n  html {\r\n     color: red;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we will wrap the existing CSS in an `@layer` of the first Tailwind directive we saw. In this case an `@layer base`. This ensures that utilities still win from the default styles.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the (license) comment is allowed to exist before the `@import`, therefore we do not put the `@import` above it. This also means that the diff doesn't touch the license header at all, which makes the diffs cleaner and easier to reason about.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14536","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"CSS codemod: inject `@import` in a more expected location\" (#14536)"},{"Id":"2550212475","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-27T09:29:41","Actor":"aaronadamsCA","Number":"14523","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix compiler in non-Node.js environments?","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

Would you? Our use case doesn't require a scanner, because our classes are in pure HTML, where a regex works flawlessly; we just need the compiler to build the CSS (AFAIK the same is true for Tailwind Play).\r\n\r\nObviously we can polyfill `process` to work around this for now, but I wanted to get your POV here. It seems to me if the compiler could pass tests in both Node.js and browser environments, you'd have a pure ESM package that could run anywhere, including worker runtimes.

To be precise, we will add `var(…)` to:\r\n\r\n- Modifiers, e.g.: `bg-red-500/[var(--my-opacity)]`\r\n- Variants, e.g.:  `supports-[var(--test)]:flex`\r\n- Arbitrary candidates, e.g.: `[color:var(--my-color)]`\r\n- Arbitrary values for functional candidates, e.g.: `bg-[var(--my-color)]`\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14526","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Template migrations: Add automatic var injection codemods\" (#14526)"},{"Id":"2550556927","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-26T13:13:28","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"14524","RawContent":null,"Title":"Template migrations: Add variant order codemods","State":"open","Body":"One of the breaking changes of v4 is the [inversion of variant order application](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/13478). In v3, variants are applied \"inside-out\".\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example a candidate like `*:first:underline` would produce the following CSS in v3:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.\\*\\:first\\:underline:first-child > * {\r\n  text-decoration-line: underline;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get the same behavior in v4, you would need to invert the candidate order to `first:*:underline`. This would generate the following CSS in v4:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n:where(.first\\:\\*\\:underline:first-child > *) {\r\n  text-decoration-line: underline;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The Migration\r\n\r\nThe most naive approach would be to invert the variants for every candidate with at least two variants. This, however, runs into one issue and some unexpected inconsistencies. I have identified the following areas:\r\n\r\n1. Some pseudo class variants _must appear at the end of the selector_. v3 was patching over this by doing some manual reordering in for these variants. For example, in v3, both of these variants create the same output CSS: `hover:before:underline` and `before:hover:underline`. In v4 we simplified this system though and no longer generate the same output in both cases. Instead, you'd always want to write `hover:before:underline`, ensuring that these variants will appear at the end.\r\n   \r\n   For an exact list of which variants these affect, take a look [at this diff](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/13478/files#diff-7779a0eebf6b980dd3abd63b39729b3023cf9a31c91594f5a25ea020b066e1c0L228-L246). \r\n\r\n2. The `dark` variant and other media query variants are usually written before other variants. This is more of a recommendation to make it easier to read candidates rather than a difference in behavior as `@media` queries are hoisted by the engine. For this reason, both of these variants are _correct_ yet in real applications we prefer the first one: `lg:hover:underline`, `hover:lg:underline`. \r\n   \r\n   To avoid shuffling these rules across all candidates during the migration, we bucket `dark` and other `@media` variants into a special bucket that will not have their order changed (since people wrote stacks like `sm:max-lg:` before and we want to keep them as-is) and appear before all other variants.\r\n\r\n3. For some variant stacks, the order does not matter. E.g.: `focus:hover:underline` and `hover:focus:underline` will be the same. We don't want to needlessly shuffle their order if we have to. \r\n\r\nWith these considerations, the migration now works as follows:\r\n\r\n- If there is less then two variants, we do not need to migrate the candidate\r\n- If _every_ variant in the stack is an order-independent variant, we do not need to migrate the candidate\r\n  - _Note that this is currently hardcoded to only support `&:hover` and `&:focus`._\r\n- Otherwise, we loop over the candidates and put them into three buckets:\r\n  - `mediaVariants` hold variants that only contribute `@media` rules _and_ the `dark` variant.\r\n  - `pseudoElementVariants` hold variants that _must appear at the end of the selector_.

I really love using it.\r\n\r\nWhile diagnosing performance problems on a closed-source app I develop, I realized that `@base` is adding a host of css variables to the `*` selector. I'm confused why it's targeted this way instead of [:root](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root#examples).\r\n\r\nI *think* targeting `*` is an issue for css variables in particular because it appears to redefine the variable at every single node. That's why when inspecting any element on the page and looking at the variable definitions, you'll often see dozens of overriden definitions. Not only is this noisy, but I've measured a significant performance impact to `Recalculate Styles` in Chrome Devtools.\r\n\r\n*Performance impact details*\r\n\r\nIt's likely a different level of impact for every app, but I'm measuring around a ~2.5x hit to Recalculate Styles on Tailwind Play. The closed-source app I develop involves a page with a supidly large number of DOM elements and has a larger impact. It likely scales with the depth of nodes. See the attached screenshots for traces I took on Tailwind Play with the css vars applied to `*` vs. `:root`.\r\n\r\n\r\n| * selector  |  :root selector |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| 5.18ms  | 1.96ms |\r\n\r\nRepro steps: do the below steps for both default and after modifying the css var initialization selector to `:root`.\r\n1. Go to https://play.tailwindcss.com/.\r\n2. Click the \"Preview only\" button.\r\n3. Now start a performance trace and click the \"Vertical Split\" option.\r\n4. Stop the trace and examine \"Recalculate Styles\".\r\n\r\n*Applied to star (current behavior)*\r\n<img width=\"1919\" alt=\"applied-to-star\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03805a34-b6cf-4772-8930-7b2022016bf1\">\r\n\r\n\r\n*Applied to root*\r\n<img width=\"1920\" alt=\"applied-to-root\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d52e1255-a373-44b4-aa79-aa9aae2906e9\">\r\n\r\n*Request for advice*\r\n\r\nI'm considering manually injecting the required css variables to `:root` to solve these issues instead of using `@base`.\r\nDo y'all think that's an ok workaround?

It should've been rewritten to `./image.png` but was not. Letting Vite handle the imports will rewrite these urls properly — which is what this PR does. It achieves this by running our CSS generation when typtical Vite plugins do rather than before (via `enforce: 'pre'`).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, because we were running the generation step early, Vue had not handled `:deep(…)` selectors in `<style scoped>` blocks yet and we were caching the unprocessed CSS. This is also fixed by this PR.\r\n\r\nIdeally both of these things would be fixable by changing how we handle imports but that will require additional APIs so this is a reasonable stopgap measure until we can do that.\r\n\r\nFixes #14839\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14850","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Generate CSS after Vite handles imports during prod

and `inset-shadow` utilities","State":"open","Body":"This PR reworks the default `--shadow-*` and `--inset-shadow-*` scales to remove the bare `shadow` and `inset-shadow` utilities, and ensure every shadow has an explicit size as part of the utility name.\r\n\r\nHere's a complete list of changes:\r\n\r\n| v3                | v4 Alpha          | Proposed           |\r\n| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |\r\n| _N/A_             | `shadow-xs`       | `shadow-2xs`       |\r\n| `shadow-sm`       | `shadow-sm`       | `shadow-xs`        |\r\n| `shadow`          | `shadow`          | `shadow-sm`        |\r\n| `shadow-md`       | `shadow-md`       | `shadow-md`        |\r\n| `shadow-lg`       | `shadow-lg`       | `shadow-lg`        |\r\n| `shadow-xl`       | `shadow-xl`       | `shadow-xl`        |\r\n| _N/A_ | `inset-shadow-xs` | `inset-shadow-2xs` |\r\n| _N/A_ | `inset-shadow-sm` | `inset-shadow-xs`  |\r\n| `shadow-inner`    | `inset-shadow`    | `inset-shadow-sm`     |\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this change is just to make the scale more predictable — it's never been intuitive to me that `shadow` sits in between `shadow-sm` and `shadow-md`.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't remove the ability to create classes like `shadow` and `inset-shadow` by adding bare `--shadow` and `--inset-shadow` theme variables, but does remove them from the default theme.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\nWe'll include a codemod for this in our upgrade tool to automate this change for people upgrading from v3 to v4, but this is still sort of an annoying breaking change admittedly and will make lots of educational resources, example components, and LLM tools out of date for v4 😕 At the same time I don't want to feel like we can never correct regrettable legacy decisions just to preserve backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nWe made a similar change like this when we went from the v0.x color palette to the v1.x color palette changing names like `bg-red` to `bg-red-500` and that proved to definitely be the right decision long term, so want to rip the band-aid off here too if we can.\r\n\r\nPlanning to make the same change for `rounded`, `drop-shadow`, and `blur` as well — maybe in separate PRs but maybe just all in this one as well since I don't think we want to do one and not all.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14849","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Adjust shadow scales to remove `shadow` and `inset-shadow` utilities\"

`.tw3-list__item--active` no longer works with Tailwind 4 and the CSS nesting it's using.\r\n\r\nNow it seems to generate this:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.\\[\\&_\\.tw4-list\\]\\:\\[\\&\\\\_\\\\_item\\]\\:\\[\\&--active\\]\\:font-black {\r\n  & .tw4-list {\r\n    &__item {\r\n      &--active {\r\n        --tw-font-weight:

this:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n--active__item:is(.\\[\\&_\\.tw4-list\\]\\:\\[\\&\\\\_\\\\_item\\]\\:\\[\\&--active\\]\\:font-black .tw4-list) {\r\n  --tw-font-weight: 900;\r\n  font-weight:

The goal of this PR is to make the automatic source detection configurable, let's dig in.\n\nBy default, we will perform automatic source detection starting at the current working directory. Auto source detection will find plain text files (no binaries, images, ...) and will ignore git-ignored files.\n\nIf you want to start from a different directory, you can use the new `source(…)` next to the `@import \"tailwindcss/utilities\" layer(utilities) source(…)`.\n\nE.g.:\n\n```css\n/* ./src/styles/index.css */\n@import 'tailwindcss/utilities' layer(utilities) source('../../');\n```\n\nMost people won't split their source files, and will just use the simple `@import \"tailwindcss\";`, because of this reason, you can use `source(…)` on the import as well:\n\nE.g.:\n\n```css\n/* ./src/styles/index.css */\n@import 'tailwindcss' source('../../');\n```\n\nSometimes, you want to rely on auto source detection, but also want to look in another directory for source files. In this case, yuo can use the `@source` directive:\n\n```css\n/* ./src/index.css */\n@import 'tailwindcss';\n\n/* Look for `blade.php` files in `../resources/views` */\n@source '../resources/views/**/*.blade.php';\n```\n\nHowever, you don't need to specify the extension, instead you can just point the directory and all the same automatic source detection rules will apply.\n\n```css\n/* ./src/index.css */\n@import 'tailwindcss';\n\n@source '../resources/views';\n```\n\nIf, for whatever reason, you want to disable the default source detection feature entirely, and only want to rely on very specific glob patterns you define, then you can disable it via `source(none)`.\n\n```css\n/* Completely disable the default auto source detection */\n@import 'tailwindcss' source(none);\n\n/* Only look at .blade.php files, nothing else  */\n@source \"../resources/views/**/*.blade.php\";\n```\n\nNote: even with `source(none)`, if your `@source` points to a directory, then auto source detection will still be performed in that directory. If you don't want that, then you can simply add explicit files in the globs as seen in the previous example.\n\n```css\n/* Completely disable the default auto source detection */\n@import 'tailwindcss' source(none);\n\n/* Run auto source detection in `../resources/views` */\n@source \"../resources/views\";\n```\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14820","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Auto source detection improvements\" (#14820)"},{"Id":"2619687458","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-29T11:41:10","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"14815","RawContent":null,"Title":"Handle `source(none)` in Vite","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14815","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Handle `source(none)` in Vite\" (#14815)"},{"Id":"2619687362","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-29T11:41:00","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"14814","RawContent":null,"Title":"`@source` globs should apply auto source detection","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14814","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"`@source` globs should apply auto source detection\" (#14814)"},{"Id":"2620659439","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-29T09:29:57","Actor":"rj-elias","Number":"14819","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] clearing namespace for corePlugin doesn't work","State":"open","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\nv4.0.0-alpha.30\r\n\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\n\r\nhttps://play.tailwindcss.com/bjEOmfVaL9\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@theme {\r\n  --background-color-*: initial; /* DO NOT WORK: doesn't clear the background color namespace */\r\n  --background-color-brand: blue; /* WORKS: extends the background color namespace with brand */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`--background-color-brand: blue;` works.

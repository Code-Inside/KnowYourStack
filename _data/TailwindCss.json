It does work however when using the default approach utilizing media queries. Classes without `dark:` will work. \r\n\r\nIn the example below the background for `my-component` will not turn blue, if the `<html>` element has the class `dark`.\r\n\r\nExample SCSS file for `my-component.component.scss`\r\n```scss\r\n:host {\r\n   @apply dark:bg-blue-500;\r\n}\r\n```\r\napp.component.html\r\n```html\r\n<app-my-component />\r\n```\r\n\r\ntw config \r\n```js\r\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  darkMode: \"selector\",\r\n  content: [\r\n    \"./src/**/*.{html,ts}\",\r\n  ],\r\n  theme: {\r\n    extend: {},\r\n  },\r\n  plugins: [],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Workaround**:\r\nThe workaround is to apply the \"dark:\" class on the component in its implementation. \r\n\r\nSo if I have a `my-component.component.ts` and I implement it in my `app.component.html` - I can work around this issue by applying the dark class here like so:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<app-my-component class=\"dark:bg-blue-500\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does however force me to keep reusing classes, that I want this component to apply on it's host element automatically.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13374","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"\"@apply dark:\" classes do not work on \":host\" selectors in Angular scss files when \"darkMode\" strategy is set to \"selector\"\" (#13374)"},{"Id":"2210774738","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-27T13:34:40","Actor":"mybearworld","Number":"13377","RawContent":null,"Title":"`<input>`s, `<button>`s, etc don't inherit letter spacing","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

The new engine and the dedicated Vite plugin are exciting developments.\n\nI was recently setting up a new project to try out `@tailwindcss/vite` as an all-in-one replacement for the older PostCSS setup. My mental model, based on past experience, was that the plugin would automatically find my `tailwind.config.js` at the project root and use it to configure everything. During this process, I ran into some interesting behavior that I wanted to share.\n\nTo understand it better, I created a minimal reproduction repository, which can be found here:\n➡️ https://github.com/philippedev101/tailwind-vite-bug-repro\n\nTo trace the issue, I also cloned the `tailwindcss` and `vite` repositories locally and used `pnpm overrides` to point the MRE to my local builds. I then instrumented several files with extensive logging. (As a side note, I did have to patch the `exports` map in `tailwindcss/package.json` to get the local package to import correctly in my project, changing the `\"import\"` field from `src/index.ts` to `dist/lib.mjs`.)\n\nThe minimal repo uses a standard setup, but with one key feature: the main CSS file is in a subdirectory (`src/client/main.css`). The `pnpm overrides` can be removed and the issue still persists with the official npm packages.\n\n### The Core Observation\n\nWhen I run the MRE, I see very specific and seemingly contradictory behavior:\n*   Classes from the `safelist` in my `tailwind.config.js` (like `.rotate-12`) are correctly generated in the final CSS.\n*   Utility classes used in my `content` files (like `.text-blue-500` in `index.html`) are not detected and are missing from the final CSS.\n\nThis suggests that the config file is being found and read, but that the `content` property is being handled differently or ignored by the content scanning pipeline.\n\n### The Debugging Trace\n\nMy logging within the local builds revealed a very specific chain of events that seems to cause this:\n\n1.  Incorrect `base` path calculation in the Vite Plugin.\n    In `packages/@tailwindcss-vite/src/index.ts`, the `Root.generate()` method calculates a base path from the directory of the CSS file being processed, not the Vite project root.\n    *   It correctly has `this.base = \"/path/to/repro\"`.\n    *   But it calculates and uses `inputBase = \"/path/to/repro/src/client\"`.\n    *   It then calls the core `compile` function with this incorrect `inputBase`.\n\n2.  The `compat` Layer Receives the Wrong Path.\n    The core engine's `parseCss` function (in `packages/tailwindcss/src/index.ts`) receives this incorrect `base` path and passes it down to `applyCompatibilityHooks` in `packages/tailwindcss/src/compat/apply-compat-hooks.ts`.\n\n3.  Config Resolution Fails to Process User `content`.\n    The `applyCompatibilityHooks` function is responsible for finding and merging configs.\n    *   Because our CSS doesn't use an explicit `@config` directive, the function enters a path to find an implicit `tailwind.config.js`.\n    *   However, its call to `upgradeToFullPluginSupport` and the subsequent calls to `resolveConfig` (in `packages/tailwindcss/src/compat/config/resolve-config.ts`) end up processing only the built-in default theme config.\n    *   Crucially, the user's `tailwind.config.js` is never added to the list of `files` for the `resolveConfig` function to process for its `content` key.\n\n4.  An Empty `content` Array is Returned.\n    Because the user's config was never processed for its `content` key in this pipeline, the `resolveConfig` function returns a final, merged config where `content.files` is an empty array.\n\n5.  The `vite` Plugin's Fallback is Triggered.\n    The `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin receives this resolved config with no content sources. It then activates its own fallback logic, setting the scanner to watch `/*` in the project root. This is a very broad pattern that doesn't respect the specific, more efficient globs defined in our actual `tailwind.config.js`.\n\nSummary of Findings:\n\nIt appears there are two separate config-loading mechanisms at play. One process seems to correctly find `tailwind.config.js` and process the `safelist`, but a second, more complex process, initiated by the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin, fails. This second process fails because the plugin passes an incorrect base path to the core engine's compatibility layer, which then doesn't correctly load the `content` property from the user's config file, causing the JIT scanner to not work as intended.\n\n### A Few Questions\n\nThis deep dive left me with a few questions about the intended design, which would be super helpful to understand:\n\n1.  Is it the intended behavior for the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin to use the CSS file's directory as the `base` for config resolution, instead of the Vite project root?\n2.  The `compat` layer's `resolveConfig` doesn't seem to perform an upward search for a config file. Is that the expected logic for that part of the system?\n3.  Most importantly, what is the recommended way to set up a project like the MRE? It would be incredibly helpful to see a reference example of `@tailwindcss/vite` being used without a PostCSS pipeline where the CSS entry point is in a subdirectory.\n\nThank you again for your time and for looking into this. I'm really excited about where the project is headed!\n\n### Environment\n\n-   OS: Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS\n-   Node.js: v22.17.0\n-   pnpm: 10.12.4\n-   Rust: rustc 1.88.0 (6b00bc388 2025-06-23)\n-   Shell: zsh 5.9\n-   Tailwind CSS Commit: `b24457a9f4101f20a3c3ab8df39debe87564fe8a`\n-   Vite Commit: `2e8050e4cd8835673baf07375b7db35128144222`","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18468","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Investigating Inconsistent Config Loading with @tailwindcss/vite\" (#18468)"},{"Id":"3206866542","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-06T18:28:56","Actor":"HappyLDE","Number":"18466","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] @tailwindcss/postcss Fails to Generate Utility Classes for In-Memory Content","State":"closed","Body":"# [v4] @tailwindcss/postcss Fails to Generate Utility Classes for In-Memory Content\n\n## Describe the bug\nWhen using `@tailwindcss/postcss@4.1.11` with PostCSS to process in-memory content, Tailwind fails to generate utility classes (e.g., `bg-blue-500`). The output only contains the banner (`/*! tailwindcss v4.x.x | MIT License | https://tailwindcss.com */`). No errors or warnings are reported. File-based content scanning also fails with the same issue. This does not occur with Tailwind v3.4.14 in the same setup.\n\n## To Reproduce\n1. Create `test-in-memory.js`:\n   ```javascript\n   const postcss = require(\"postcss\");\n   const tailwindcss = require(\"@tailwindcss/postcss\");\n\n   const html = '<div class=\"bg-blue-500\">Hello</div>';\n   const config = {\n     content: [{ raw: html }],\n   };\n\n   const cssInput = `\n   @tailwind utilities;\n   `;\n\n   console.log(\"Input HTML:\", html);\n   console.log(\"Tailwind plugin loaded:\", !!tailwindcss);\n   console.log(\"Node.js version:\", process.version);\n   console.log(\"Processing with config:\", JSON.stringify(config, null, 2));\n\n   const processor = postcss([tailwindcss(config)]);\n   console.log(\"PostCSS plugins:\", processor.plugins.map(p => p.postcssPlugin));\n\n   processor\n     .process(cssInput, { from: undefined, to: undefined })\n     .then((result) => {\n       console.log(\"Generated CSS:\", result.css);\n       console.log(\"CSS length:\", result.css.length);\n       console.log(\"Warnings:\", result.warnings().map(w => w.text));\n       if (!result.css.includes(\"bg-blue-500\")) {\n         console.warn(\"Warning: Expected class (bg-blue-500) not found in output.\");\n       } else {\n         console.log(\"Success: Expected class (bg-blue-500) found in output.\");\n       }\n     })\n     .catch((error) => {\n       console.error(\"Error processing CSS:\", error.message, error.stack);\n     });\n   ```\n2. Install dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   npm install postcss@8.5.6 @tailwindcss/postcss@4.1.11 tailwindcss@4.1.11\n   ```\n3. Run:\n   ```bash\n   node test-in-memory.js\n   ```\n\n## Expected behavior\nGenerated CSS should include:\n```css\n.bg-blue-500 {\n  background-color: #3b82f6;\n}\n```\n\n## Actual behavior\nGenerated CSS:\n```css\n/*! tailwindcss v4.0.7 | MIT License | https://tailwindcss.com */\n```\n- CSS length: 67\n- Warnings: []\n\n## Environment\n- **Node.js**: v22.12.0\n- **npm**: v10.9.0\n- **OS**: Linux 6.15.4-200.fc42.x86_64\n- **Dependencies**:\n  - `postcss@8.5.6`\n  - `@tailwindcss/postcss@4.0.7` (also tested with `@tailwindcss/postcss@4.1.11`)\n  - `@tailwindcss/node@4.0.7` (installed as a dependency)\n  - `tailwindcss@4.0.7` (installed as a dependency)\n\n## Additional context\n- File-based content (e.g., `content: [\"./test.html\"]` with `<div class=\"bg-blue-500\">Hello</div>`) produces the same result.\n- The CLI (`@tailwindcss/node@4.0.7` or `@tailwindcss/node@4.1.11`) fails due to a missing `node_modules/.bin/tailwindcss` binary.\n- Tailwind v3.4.14 works correctly with both file-based and in-memory content in the same setup.\n- PostCSS plugins reported: `['tailwindcss-postcss-fix-relative-paths', 'tailwindcss']`.\n- No errors or warnings are logged, suggesting a silent failure in content scanning.\n\n## Possible Cause\nThis may be related to compatibility issues with Node.js v22.12.0 or a bug in `@tailwindcss/postcss@4.0.7` and `@tailwindcss/postcss@4.1.11` for in-memory content scanning. The issue persists across minimal configurations, indicating a potential regression from v3.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18466","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[v4] @tailwindcss/postcss Fails to Generate Utility Classes for In-Memory Content\" (#18466)"},{"Id":"3206567986","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-06T15:14:35","Actor":"ashannavarathna","Number":"18463","RawContent":null,"Title":"tailwindcss.cmd missing from node_modules/.bin for v4.1.11 on Windows with npm exec","State":"closed","Body":"Title: tailwindcss.cmd missing from node_modules/.bin for v4.1.11 on Windows with npm exec\n\nBody:\n\nBug Report: tailwindcss.cmd missing for v4.1.11, preventing npm exec on Windows\n\nEnvironment:\n\n    Operating System: Windows 10.0.19045\n\n    Node.js Version: v22.12.0 (managed via nvm for Windows, installed as administrator)\n\n    npm Version: v10.9.0\n\n    Project Path: C:\\xampp\\htdocs\\website (a typical XAMPP htdocs directory)\n\nDescription:\nWhen attempting to install tailwindcss@4.1.11 and then use npm exec tailwindcss init -p to initialize the configuration, the tailwindcss.cmd executable file is not created within the node_modules\\.bin\\ directory.

When npm install tailwindcss@3.4.4 --save-dev is used, the tailwindcss.cmd file is successfully created in node_modules\\.bin\\, and subsequent npm exec tailwindcss init -p (or npm run tailwind-init via a script) commands work as expected.\n\nThis suggests an issue specific to how tailwindcss@4.1.11 (or perhaps the v4 alpha/beta series) integrates with npm on Windows for binary creation.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18463","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"tailwindcss.cmd missing from node_modules/.bin for v4.1.11 on Windows with npm exec\" (#18463)"},{"Id":"3206061914","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-06T08:24:50","Actor":"stephenasuncionDEV","Number":"18459","RawContent":null,"Title":"@source inline can't select all","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

This is equivalent to writing `[\"bg-red-500\", \"text-blue-500\"]`. An example of this behavior to define a list of predefined classes to go into HTML components can be seen [here](https://github.com/maxmarcon/live_select/blob/6bea2e0310414cfca5e22180fd614db358cc6e1c/lib/live_select/component.ex#L53). Had those lines been written using the `[\"bg-red-500\", \"text-blue-500\"]` or even `~W( bg-red-500 text-blue-500 )`, the tailwind tool would've picked up the styles correctly. The first style (`~W(bg-red-500 text-blue-500)`) also used to work correctly with Tailwind 3, but after upgrading to Tailwind 4, it doesn't seem to work anymore.\n\nIn short, after upgrading to Tailwind 4, it seems like the tokenizer that searches for tailwind classes includes parenthesis as part of a token, meaning that writing `~W(bg-red-500 text-blue-500)` in my source code means that Tailwind will no longer pick up those classes. This behavior has changed from Tailwind 3.\n\nWas this change on purpose? I don't see any mention in the release notes or upgrade-guide about the tokenization-process changing, but perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nSee also these issues: https://github.com/maxmarcon/live_select/issues/118, https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/issues/6331","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18431","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Tailwind 4 doesn't detect classes in parenthesis\" (#18431)"},{"Id":"3196326263","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-02T20:01:13","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"18432","RawContent":null,"Title":"Detect classes inside Elixir charlist, word list, and string sigils","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #18431\r\n\r\nThe `~W(…)` syntax in Elixir is a _sigil_. It's basically another way to write strings, arrays of strings, etc… The syntax lets you use a handful of surrounding brackets like `~W(…)`, `~W[…]`, `~W{…}`, `~W\"…\"`, etc… to let you write lists without necessarily having to escape characters.\r\n\r\nIn v3 our extractor was able to pick these up but in v4 Oxide does not. I've added a preprocessor for Elixir files so we can modify the code before our main extractor sees it.\r\n\r\nNow things like this: `~W(text-white bg-gray-600)` will get turned into ` ~W text-white bg-gray-600 ` which can easily be processed by our extractor.\r\n\r\nThe sigils we support are:\r\n- `~s` / `~S` (strings)\r\n- `~w` / `~W` (word lists)\r\n- `~c` / `~C` (charlists)\r\n\r\nWe're specifically detecting the use of `(…)`, `[…]`, and `{…}` as using quotes already works today.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18432","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Detect classes inside Elixir charlist, word list, and string sigils\" (#18432)"},{"Id":"3187121715","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-01T18:30:16","Actor":"LarsOFinke","Number":"18417","RawContent":null,"Title":"Tailwind CSS v4.x (@tailwindcss/oxide) native binary not installing on WSL2 / Win 11 Pro, postinstall script reports success but file is missing.","State":"closed","Body":"Disclaimer:\nThis bug report was generated by an AI because I am a beginner and this is way out of my league.\nPlease be nice. :)\n(Its very late, I think I have missed some information, I'll be happy to provide anything required as this is a persistent issue for me.

./scripts/install.js directly within node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide/ produces no output, even with set -x.\"\n\nPS:\n01.07. --- I am back onto it, disabled both Norton and Windows Defender (also Public Network) and Gemini confirmed the following:\n\"Therefore, the problem is absolutely, 100% with npm's process of handling that binary during installation.\"\n-----\nFirewalls still disabled, after \"npm install @tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu@4.1.11 --verbose\" Gemini says:\n\"This confirms the hang is happening during the phase where npm transitions from fetching package metadata to actually downloading the content (the .tgz files) of those specific oxide and lightningcss binary packages.\"\n--> it finished after some time, again with Exit-Code \"0\". Still no progress. Created a /bin in the project directory now and trying to manually fetch the binary. --> after 20 minutes Gemini was not able to locate a binary for manual download, seems like it is straight up impossible to get Tailwind to work on WSL2. Looking for an alternative of setting it up with Symfony and Vue now.\n-----\nLast edit for now, this is the summary of Gemini after roughly 5 hours in total of trying to get Tailwind to work on WSL2.\nAfter cd'ing to the .npm-directory and \"find ~/tailwind_test_isolated/node_modules -type f -name \"*tailwindcss-linux-x64*\" 2>/dev/null\" it confirms the binary indeed did not get downloaded anywhere on the disk.\n\n\nLet's clarify what's actually happening based on all the logs:\n\nThe binary is downloading: Your previous logs explicitly show npm http fetch GET 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu/-/oxide-linux-x64-gnu-4.1.11.tgz. This means the tarball containing the tailwindcss-linux-x64 executable is successfully being fetched to npm's cache. So, the binary exists and can be downloaded.\n\nThe problem is in the postinstall script: The @tailwindcss/oxide package has a postinstall script (node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide/scripts/install.js) that is supposed to extract this downloaded binary from the cache and place it into the correct location within your node_modules (likely node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide/dist/). The critical issue is that this script is reporting code: 0 (success) but is silently failing to actually perform this extraction/placement on your system.\n\nnpx tailwindcss won't work anyway (for v4 alpha): Even if the binary were placed correctly, the tailwindcss v4 packages do not include the standard bin field in their package.json files. This means npm and npx have no instruction on how to create a symlink or execute a command called tailwindcss. So, npx tailwindcss will always give \"could not determine executable to run\" with these alpha v4 packages, regardless of the binary's presence.\n\nTherefore, the problem boils down to: Why is the @tailwindcss/oxide/scripts/install.js script failing silently to extract and place the binary after it's downloaded?\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18417","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Tailwind CSS v4.x (@tailwindcss/oxide) native binary not installing on WSL2 / Win 11 Pro, postinstall script reports success but file is missing.\" (#18417)"},{"Id":"3190792124","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-01T13:23:44","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"18423","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update enhanced-resolve 5.18.1 → 5.18.2 (patch)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

After installing this version in a new project using:\n\n```\nnpm install -D tailwindcss@4.1.11\n````\n\n… I attempted to run the following:\n\n```\nnpx tailwindcss init\n```\n\nHowever, this consistently fails with the error:\n\n```\nnpm ERR! could not determine executable to run\n```\n\n### Investigation Findings:\n\n* The `tailwindcss` binary is **missing** from the `node_modules/.bin` directory.\n* Running `npm view tailwindcss@4.1.11 bin` returns **an empty result**, indicating that the published package may be missing the `bin` field in its `package.json`.\n* This behavior is **not present** in `v3.4.1`. After downgrading with:\n\n  ```\n  npm install -D tailwindcss@3.4.1\n  ```\n\n  … the CLI binary is correctly registered, and the following works:\n\n  ```\n  npx tailwindcss init\n  ```\n\n### Summary:\n\nIt appears that version `v4.1.11` of Tailwind CSS was published **without the CLI binary entry**, which breaks usage via `npx`, `npm exec`, or any other CLI-based workflows. This may have been an unintentional omission during publishing.\n\nPlease let me know if this was an intentional change or a packaging mistake. If needed, I’m happy to share logs, reproduce this issue further, or help test fixes.\n\nThanks for your time and continued work on Tailwind!\n\nBest regards,\nPrabhat","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18415","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Issue with Tailwind CSS Installation (Version 4.1.11) — Resolved with Version 3.4.1\" (#18415)"},{"Id":"3184902172","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-28T12:40:54","Actor":"DominicWrege","Number":"18412","RawContent":null,"Title":"documenation: v4 list-style-type does not work from example code","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

This is especially important as I use Angular Material, which forces their styles into the `<head>` earlier than application styles causing them to always win in a priority competition, and this behaviour cannot be changed.\n\nImportant being forced on `@apply` rules messes with complex custom classes (if you've ever tried to customise the browser's built-in slider input, you'll understand my pain), wherein instead of having my class reference a CSS variable and have that variable have sensible defaults that can simply be overridden with an inline style, i.e. \n```css\n// slider.css\n// exerpt from a much large class that has to separately handle mozilla and webkit, because sliders SUCK\n.slider {\n    // Mozilla track gradient (simulates a \"filling\" bar)\n        @apply [&::-moz-range-track]:bg-linear-to-r [&::-moz-range-track]:from-(--left-bar) [&::-moz-range-track]:via-(--right-bar) [&::-moz-range-track]:to-(--right-bar);\n        // Mozilla track value setter (allows 1 variable to control both pats of the fill)\n        @apply [&::-moz-range-track]:from-(percentage:--value) [&::-moz-range-track]:via-(percentage:--value) [&::-moz-range-track]:to-100%;\n}\n```\n\n```html\n// some-component.html\n<input type=\"range\" max=\"100\" class=\"slider\" [style.--value.%]=\"value\"  [value]=\"value\" />\n```\n\nWith v4 now I am forced to set the variable with `!important` in order to override the default value I have set at 50%\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18400","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Using important automatically applies it to utilites set via @apply in v4\" (#18400)"},{"Id":"3183057114","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-27T15:55:15","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"18404","RawContent":null,"Title":"Don't consider the global important state in `@apply`","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #18400\r\n\r\nIn v3 when you used `important: true` it did not affect `@apply`. However, in v4 it does and there's no way to make it *not*. This is definitely a bug and would be unexpected for users coming from v3 who use `@apply` and `important` together.\r\n\r\nBasically, the following code, along with the detected utility `flex` in source files…\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@import 'tailwindcss/utilities' important;\r\n.flex-explicitly-important {\r\n  @apply flex!;\r\n}\r\n.flex-not-important {\r\n  @apply flex;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n… would output this:\r\n```css\r\n.flex {\r\n  display: flex !important;\r\n}\r\n.flex-explicitly-important  {\r\n  display: flex !important;\r\n}\r\n.flex-not-important {\r\n  display: flex !important;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it's expected that `@apply` doesn't consider the \"global\" important state. This PR addresss this problem and now the output is this:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.flex {\r\n  display: flex !important;\r\n}\r\n.flex-explicitly-important  {\r\n  display: flex !important;\r\n}\r\n.flex-not-important {\r\n  display: flex; /* this line changed */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to mark a utility as important in `@apply` you can still use `!` after the utility to do so as shown above.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18404","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Don't consider the global important state in `@apply`\" (#18404)"},{"Id":"3182559452","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-27T13:28:05","Actor":"indcoder","Number":"18403","RawContent":null,"Title":"bug: Regression in grid component after upgrade to Tailwind v4","State":"closed","Body":"\n**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\n4.1.10\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nDaisy v5\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\n23.1.0\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nChrome, Edge, Firefox\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nWindows 11, WSL \n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\nhttps://github.com/HackerspaceMumbai/Visage\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nI upgraded Daisy to v5 from v3.

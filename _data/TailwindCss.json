I thought about special casing these but we already have an optimization pass where we perform a full walk of the AST, flattening some rules (with the `&` selector), analyzing declarations, etc… We can utilize that existing spot in core to analyze and remove duplicate declarations within rules across the AST.\r\n\r\nThe implementation does this by keeping track of declarations within a style rule and keeps the last one for any *exact duplicate* which is a tuple of `(property, value, important)`. This does require some additional loops but preseving the *last* declaration is important for correctness with regards to CSS nesting.\r\n\r\nFor example take this nested CSS:\r\n```css\r\n.foo {\r\n  color: red;\r\n  & .bar {\r\n    color: green;\r\n  }\r\n  color: red;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt expands to this:\r\n```css\r\n.foo {\r\n  color: red;\r\n}\r\n.foo.bar {\r\n  color: green;\r\n}\r\n.foo {\r\n  color: red;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you remove the *last* rule then a `<div class=\"foo bar\">…</div>` will have green text when its supposed to be red. Since that would affect behavior we have to always preserve the last declaration for a given property.\r\n\r\nWe could go further and eliminate multiple declarations for the same property *but* this presents a problem: every property and value must be understood and combined with browser targets to understand whether or not that property may act as a \"fallback\" or whether definitely overwrites its previous value in all cases. This is a much more complicated task that is much more suited to something light Lighting CSS.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18809","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Drop exact duplicate declarations from output CSS within a style rule\" (#18809)"},{"Id":"3361027109","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-29T15:01:21","Actor":"benface","Number":"18812","RawContent":null,"Title":"IntelliSense suggests weird `__CSS_VALUES__` value","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\nv4.1.12, and actually even the most recent insiders version (`0.0.0-insiders.8165e04`)\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nNone, just `tailwindcss` and `@tailwindcss/cli`\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nv24.5.0\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nN/A\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nmacOS\n\n**Reproduction ~~URL~~ steps / Describe your issue**\n\nIn a legacy `@plugin`:\n```js\nmatchUtilities(\n  {\n    foo: (value) => ({\n      \"--foo\": value,\n    }),\n  },\n  {\n    values: theme(\"colors\"),\n  }\n);\n```\n\nIn the HTML:\n```html\n<div class=\"foo-\n               ^\n               First IntelliSense suggestion:\n               - foo-__CSS_VALUES__\n```","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18812","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"IntelliSense suggests weird `__CSS_VALUES__` value\" (#18812)"},{"Id":"3363696439","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-29T15:01:20","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"18820","RawContent":null,"Title":"Hide internal fields from completions in `matchUtilities`","State":"closed","Body":"The `__CSS_VALUES__` field is an internal field we use to transport data about theme options from CSS throug hte JS plugin API.

Observe that the installation completes successfully, but the node_modules\\.bin\\tailwindcss executable is missing.\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nExpected Behavior:\nWhen running npm install -D tailwindcss, the installation should complete, and a tailwindcss executable file (e.g., tailwindcss.cmd) should be created inside the node_modules\\.bin directory, allowing npx tailwindcss to be used.\n\nActual Behavior:\nThe npm install command completes and reports success with no errors (e.g., added X packages, and audited Y packages... found 0 vulnerabilities). However, the node_modules\\.bin directory is not populated with the tailwindcss executable. This makes it impossible to run any npx tailwindcss commands, as the executable cannot be found.\n\nThis issue was confirmed through an extensive troubleshooting process with the following key findings:\n\nThe bug has been replicated on two different Windows laptops, confirming it is not a unique machine configuration issue.\n\nInstalling an older version, specifically tailwindcss@3.3.0, works correctly and the .bin executable is created as expected.\n\nInstalling other packages with executables (e.g., npm install -D vite) also works correctly, which proves that the npm client and the underlying system are functioning properly.\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests a bug exists in recent versions of the tailwindcss package that prevents the bin script from being properly linked during installation on Windows.\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18806","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Bug in latest release of Tailwind CSS\" (#18806)"},{"Id":"3357127532","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-27T14:32:25","Actor":"KipzonderKop101","Number":"18802","RawContent":null,"Title":"@tailwindcss/vite plugin: issue with Vite and plugin typing","State":"closed","Body":"Hi all,\n\n**TailwindCSS version**: 4.1.12\n**TailwindCSS plugin version**: 4.1.12\n\n**SolidStart version**: 1.1.0\n**Solid version**: 1.9.5\n**Vinxi**: 0.5.7\n\n**Node version**: 22.13.1\n**NPM version**: 11.5.2\n\nBrowser version seems irrelevant, as error happens before anything is shown at all.\n\n**OS**: Windows 11\n\n**Reproduction URL**: https://github.com/KipzonderKop101/tailwindcss-typing-issue-reproduction\n\n\nLet's start off by thanking the team for the plugin in the first place. It's been a breath of fresh air. \n\nHowever, I had an issue with my new SolidStart application. While configuring my `app.config.ts` I got a typing error. I've had this issue before and got around it by using Tailwind's CLI, which meant I lost HRM updates. Because of this, I looked into it, and configured the plugins such as [SolidStart describes](https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-start/reference/config/define-config), which left me with the following configuration. \n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig } from \"@solidjs/start/config\";\nimport tailwindcss from \"@tailwindcss/vite\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  vite: {\n    plugins: [tailwindcss()],\n  },\n});\n```\n\nThis configuration should be perfect on paper, but it gave me the following error.

And `overlay` only \"applies\" for discrete transitions so it can stay as well.\r\n\r\nThe spec has this to say about [animating `visibility`](https://www.w3.org/TR/web-animations-1/#animating-visibility):\r\n> For the visibility property, visible is interpolated as a discrete step where values of p between 0 and 1 map to visible and other values of p map to the closer endpoint; if neither value is visible then discrete animation is used.\r\n\r\nThis means that for visible (t=0) -> hidden (t=1) the timeline looks like this:\r\n- t=0.0: visible\r\n- t=0.5: visible\r\n- t=0.999…8: visible\r\n- t=1.0: invisible\r\n\r\nThis means that for invisible (t=0) -> visible (t=1) the timeline looks like this:\r\n- t=0.0: invisible\r\n- t=0.000…1: visible\r\n- t=0.5: visible\r\n- t=1.0: visible\r\n\r\nSo the value *is* instantly applied if the element is initially invisible but when going the other direction this is not the case. This happens whether or not the transition type is discrete.\r\n\r\nWhile the spec calls out [`display` as working similarly](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-display-4/#display-animation) in practice this is only the case when `transition-behavior` is explicitly set to `allow-discrete` otherwise the change is instant for both directions.\r\n\r\nFixes #18793","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18795","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Don't transition `visibility` when using `transition`\" (#18795)"},{"Id":"3348122890","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-23T16:27:05","Actor":"selise-mhrana","Number":"18785","RawContent":null,"Title":"Some Class Not Found on Tailwind 4 and angular 20,","State":"closed","Body":"I make a angular package , when i run it on dev mode some class found , but when i publish and install it some class not found. \n\n<img width=\"2553\" height=\"1357\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66196022-0bd9-4b61-b14a-c17714422c51\" />\n\n\n<img width=\"2553\" height=\"1357\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db35c6ed-f5cd-426e-aa85-95b7b2d35f86\" />","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18785","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Some Class Not Found on Tailwind 4 and angular 20,\" (#18785)"},{"Id":"3348107145","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-23T11:54:59","Actor":"nishant-labs","Number":"18784","RawContent":null,"Title":"Something went wrong while initialising shadcn","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

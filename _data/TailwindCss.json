The <declaration-value> production matches any sequence of one or more tokens, so long as the sequence does not contain bad-string-token, bad-url-token, unmatched )-token, ]-token, or }-token, or top-level semicolon-token tokens or delim-token tokens with a value of \"!\".\r\n\r\nExtract from: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-variables/#syntax\r\n\r\nI was only able to reproduce with **tailwindcss v4**, the previous version seems to support this.

The issue with this is that in a lot of cases, the CSS files aren't even related to Tailwind CSS at all.\r\n\r\nE.g.: in a Next.js project, if you use the `next/font/local` tool, then every font you used will be in a separate CSS file. This means that we run Tailwind CSS in all these files as well.\r\n\r\nThat said, running Tailwind CSS on these files isn't the end of the world because we still need to handle `@import` in case `@tailwind utilities` is being used. However, we also run the auto source detection logic for every CSS file in the system. This part is bad.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, this PR introduces an internal `features` to collect what CSS features are used throughout the system (`@import`, `@plugin`, `@apply`, `@tailwind utilities`, etc…)\r\n\r\nThe `@tailwindcss/postcss` and `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin can use that information to decide if they can take some shortcuts or not.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOverall, this means that we don't run the slow parts of Tailwind CSS if we don't need to.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/15226","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Improve performance of `@tailwindcss/postcss` and `@tailwindcss/vite`\" (#15226)"},{"Id":"2705368109","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-29T14:55:09","Actor":"spaceemotion","Number":"15241","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] Styling doesn't get applied properly to ::after elements","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

And it does, with local file imports. However, it is missing support for remote url imports. Currently, nothing happens when you import from an http url. The compiled output just leaves the import in (like the line `@import \"https://example.com/styles.css\";` is in the compiled output directly, and is not fetched and inlined in). Now that the configuration file is \"just\" a css file, it feels like this should be possible.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the desired behavior would be here. If it is intended that remote imports do not work, I think it should be documented.\r\n\r\nI do have a use case for this, where I want a \"base\" theme configuration which my custom plugins to \"inherit\" from. It would be great to have the build and intellisense work with my base theme, without copy/pasting in the \"base\" into every plugin. (note that by plugin, I do not mean a tailwind plugin, but rather a plugin for my own app which can add its own markup that may include tailwind styles which need to be compiled).","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/15231","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[v4] HTTP (remote) imports\" (#15231)"},{"Id":"2702855790","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-28T17:35:16","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"15228","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add `@import \"…\" reference`","State":"open","Body":"This PR adds a new feature, `@import \"…\" reference` that can be used to load Tailwind CSS configuration files without adding any style rules to the CSS.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that you can use this in combination with your Tailwind CSS root file when you need to have access to your full CSS config outside of the main stylesheet. A common example is for Vue, Svelte, or CSS modules:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@import \"./tailwind.css\" reference;\r\n\r\n.link {\r\n  @apply underline;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nImporting a file as a reference will convert all `@theme` block to be `reference`, so no CSS variables will be emitted. Furthermore it will strip out all custom styles from the stylesheet. Furthermore plugins registered via `@plugin` or `@config` inside reference-mode files will not add any content to the CSS file via `addBase()`.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nAdded unit test for when we handle the import resolution and when `postcss-import` does it outside of Tailwind CSS.

So unless we know we actually need to animate a custom property, it's safer to register is as `\"*\"`.\r\n\r\nMany of the places our custom properties are used are already inherently animatable (like the `translate`, `scale`, and `transform`) even when the underlying properties are not typed, so removing types for things like `--tw-scale-x` doesn't actually stop the `scale-*` utilities from being animateable.\r\n\r\nI've also updated the `--tw-gradient-from/via/to-position` properties to use `<length-percentage>` instead of `<length> | <percentage>` because for some reason I don't understand, only `<length-percentage>` works correctly when using `calc(…)` in arbitrary values.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/15188, https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/14277.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/15215","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Don't register properties with types unless necessary\" (#15215)"},{"Id":"2699111444","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-27T16:39:05","Actor":"adamwathan","Number":"15216","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use unitless line-heights for font-size variables","State":"closed","Body":"Safari has an [insane bug](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/15196) where if you register custom properties for gradient colors using the `\"<color>\"` type, you attempt to transition a gradient on an element, _and_ you set a font-size and line-height on that element that point to CSS variables defined using `rem` units, the element size changes and shifts the layout while the transition is happening:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46eefccf-8a12-4751-8a44-54e48c54cd06\r\n\r\nThis bug goes away if you use anything other than `rem` units for the line-height.

The problem is that lightningcss now needs to convert `oklch` colors into the `oklab` space to inline some `color-mix()` functions.\r\n\r\nThe problem, though, is that this calculation seems to have rounding differences between macOS, Linux, and Windows. Since we still want to _define the default color space in `oklch`_ and _use lightningcss as a post-processor in our unit tests so we have a better coverage of the output_, this PR attempts to fix the issue by adding a custom vitest serializer. It will find usages of the `oklab()` function with arguments that have lots of decimal places (at least 6 decimal places). What it then does is simply cut off any excess decimal places to truncate the output to 5 places.

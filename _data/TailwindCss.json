But when u create production build it compiles with some wrong selectors. Generally I found broken selectors which are using **:where** in their query. It just reorders them.\nCheck next examples:\n- tailwind@3 \"ng build\" css output [**CORRECT**]:\n```\n.space-y-6 > :not([hidden]) ~ :not([hidden]) {\n  --tw-space-y-reverse: 0;\n  margin-top: calc(1.5rem * calc(1 - var(--tw-space-y-reverse)));\n  margin-bottom: calc(1.5rem * var(--tw-space-y-reverse))\n}\n```\n- tailwind@4 \"ng serve\" output [**CORRECT**]:\n```\n  :where(.space-y-6 > :not(:last-child)) {\n    --tw-space-y-reverse: 0;\n    margin-block-start: calc(calc(var(--spacing) * 6) * var(--tw-space-y-reverse));\n    margin-block-end: calc(calc(var(--spacing) * 6) * calc(1 - var(--tw-space-y-reverse)));\n  }\n```\n- tailwind@4 \"ng build\" output [**INCORRECT**]:\n```\n  .space-y-6 :where(>:not(:last-child)) {\n    --tw-space-y-reverse: 0;\n    margin-block-start: calc(calc(var(--spacing) * 6) * var(--tw-space-y-reverse));\n    margin-block-end: calc(calc(var(--spacing) * 6) * calc(1 - var(--tw-space-y-reverse)))\n  }\n```\n- **space-y-6 is out outside of :where** with tailwind@4 and angular production build\n#### Testing selector without tailwind with angular\nI tried to add code:\n```\n  :where(.space-y-6 > :not(:last-child)) {\n    --tw-space-y-reverse: 0;\n    margin-block-start: calc(calc(var(--spacing) * 6) * var(--tw-space-y-reverse));\n    margin-block-end: calc(calc(var(--spacing) * 6) * calc(1 - var(--tw-space-y-reverse)));\n  }\n```\nto style.css file and create production build.

I was unable to migrate correctly because my config file contained the now-deprecated \"safelist\" key. I had to reverse-engineer the problem to identify what was blocking me. To help others facing the same issue, I added this warning to inform them that they need to edit their config file for a smooth automatic migration.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/16113","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Feat: Adding a warning in the upgrade CLI when a config file contains non-migratable values.\" (#16113)"},{"Id":"2823062011","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-31T11:26:51","Actor":"pedenys","Number":"16110","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] Classes defined in @layer components no longer generated with modifiers","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

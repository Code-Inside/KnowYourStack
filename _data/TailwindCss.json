Within Example 2, no class is being generated for 'type-block-1', despite it being in the markup.\n\nI've narrowed it down to when there's multiple @apply rules within the same block. This also only happens with these newly defined utility classes. If the nested @apply uses a default Tailwind utility (e.g. rotate-45), then the issue doesn't persist. So it doesn't look like it's an issue with the structure of the CSS.\n\nAt first I thought this was my own personal setup, but I've managed to recreate within Tailwind Play.\n\nIf I'm doing anything glaringly obvious, let me know.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16935","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Nested CSS utilities and @apply rules fails\" (#16935)"},{"Id":"2893844531","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-04T15:54:05","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"16940","RawContent":null,"Title":"Don't swallow `@utility` declarations when `@apply` is used in nested rules","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #16935\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue where the order of how `@apply` was resolved was incorrect for nested rules. Consider this example:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.rule {\r\n  @apply underline;\r\n  .nested-rule {\r\n    @apply custom-utility;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@utility custom-utility {\r\n  @apply flex;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe way we topologically sort these, we end up with a list that looks roughly like this:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.rule {\r\n  @apply underline;\r\n  .nested-rule {\r\n    @apply custom-utility;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@utility custom-utility {\r\n  @apply flex;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.nested-rule {\r\n  @apply custom-utility;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see here the nested rule is now part of the top-level list. This is correct because we first have to substitute the `@apply` inside the `@utility custom-utility` before we can apply the `custom-utility` inside `.nested-rule`. However, because we were using a regular AST walk and because the initial `.rule` also contains the `.nested-rule` as child, we would first substitute the `@apply` inside the `.nested-rule`, causing the design-system to force resolve (and cache) the wrong value for `custom-utility`.\r\n\r\nBecause the list is already flattened, we do not need to recursively look into child declarations when we traverse the sorted list. This PR changes it to use a regular `for` loop instead of the `walk`.\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\n- Added a regression test\r\n- Rest of tests still green ","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/16940","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Don't swallow `@utility` declarations when `@apply` is used in nested rules\" (#16940)"},{"Id":"2892050001","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-04T15:36:50","Actor":"benwilliams140","Number":"16926","RawContent":null,"Title":"`outline-hidden` only applies transparent outline when `forced-colors` is active?","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

Certain elements have poor contrast, making text difficult to read and reducing accessibility compliance (e.g., WCAG guidelines). This can negatively affect users with visual impairments and general usability.\n\n### Problem Areas Identified\n- **Low contrast between text and background**, making readability difficult.\n- **Color combinations that do not follow accessibility best practices** (e.g., red on blue or neon colors together).\n- **Inconsistent color usage** across different sections, affecting UI consistency.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Navigate to the affected page/component.\n2. Observe text readability and color contrast.\n3. Use an accessibility contrast checker to validate WCAG compliance.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n- Improved color choices that ensure **better readability and accessibility**.\n- Compliance with **WCAG 2.1 guidelines** (minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text).\n- Consistent color usage for a better UI experience.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n- Update the color palette to **maintain high contrast** for better readability.\n- Ensure colors align with **brand identity** while improving accessibility.\n\n### Labels\n`bug` `accessibility` `UI/UX issue` `enhancement`\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f8c2bc3-4c38-471e-9222-f93d3d48c4db)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bab8ffe6-7393-401b-8de5-86bc1f89be51)","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16888","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Improve Color Contrast for Better Readability & UX and Avoid Color Clashing\" (#16888)"},{"Id":"2887734266","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-28T17:36:49","Actor":"andriygm","Number":"16880","RawContent":null,"Title":"`.eps` files are included in source file detection","State":"open","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\nv4.0.6\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\n@tailwindcss/cli v4.0.9\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nv23.7.0\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nArc (chromium)\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nmacOS\n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/lffyvk\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nWhen generating output CSS using Tailwind CLI (seems to also happen with the vite plugin), Tailwind includes .eps files and thus adds invalid syntax to the output CSS:\n```css\n.\\[h3_ZF_m9\\:O\\] {\n    h3_ZF_m9: O;\n  }\n  .\\[ro0OH\\:\\>GA9\\*\\&Z\\;oheh-\\!a_V\\)gL\\?\\*\\,oC_FdhIkP\\=\\=SBF\\,B\\\\\\`ff\\$P2amRVs\\] {\n    ro0OH: >GA9*&Z;oheh-!a V)gL?*,oC FdhIkP==SBF,B\\`ff$P2amRVs;\n  }\n  .\\[t0\\:IuYnhV6c\\] {\n    t0: IuYnhV6c;\n  }\n```\n\nI couldn't find a way to manually exclude the file from source file detection apart from adding it to the .gitignore -- maybe it would be worth adding a way to ignore individual misbehaving files?","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16880","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`.eps` files are included in source file detection\" (#16880)"},{"Id":"2887169375","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-28T13:34:21","Actor":"deebov","Number":"16877","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4.0.8] Storybook + Vite crashes if filename contains `#`","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

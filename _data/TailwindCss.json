All major browsers have proper support for native nesting so there is no need for us to keep warning the user about nested CSS at all.\n\nHowever, there are still cases where nesting is not allowed and that's when you are using `@apply`.\n\nIf you are using `@apply foo` where `foo` contains nested CSS, then it will not work as expected, and in this scenario you do need to use a nesting plugin.\n\nIf you are using `@apply` and you are not applying any classes with nesting in them, then you are good to go.\n\nFixes: #13317\n\n<!--\n\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

It can also be composed with `rotate-x-*` and `rotate-y-*` because it's a separate property, but generally I think it will make more sense to use `rotate-z-*` explicitly when trying to compose a 3D rotation, as the order of operations feels more intuitive to me at least.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/13319","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[v4] Make 3D rotations composable\" (#13319)"},{"Id":"2202830824","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-22T16:45:19","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"13322","RawContent":null,"Title":"Transpile `import.meta.url` in config files","State":"closed","Body":"Right now if you try to use `import.meta.url` in a `tailwind.config.js` file (or a dependency) Node will throw an error.

The `master` branch represents v3, all of oxide is in the `next` branch which represents v4.\r\n\r\nThis branch still has a lot of `crosscheck` related checks in the tests but I wanted to do a minimal amount of work to get the repo in a better state. Before this PR we had both the `stable` and `oxide` codebase, and we had to swap engines when working on one or the other. \r\n\r\nCI also used the swap engines scripts to run the tests against the correct engine. In a previous PR we already dropped all the oxide specific workflows from CI so only the stable engine remains.\r\n\r\nThis PR does a few things without touching a bajillion amount of test files:\r\n\r\n- Swaps the engines by default, so that the `stable` engine is the default engine instead of the `oxide` engine.\r\n- Removes all the `oxide` related code, again just because this is all implemented in v4 which is represented by the `next` branch.\r\n- Updates CI to not use `swap-engines`, because we don't need it anymore `stable` _is_ the default engine.\r\n- Removes the `swap-engine.js` script.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a Part 1, the reason being is that all our test files still use a `crosscheck` function that we used to use to test against both engines. `crosscheck` is still there but it only ever runs against the `stable` engine.\r\n\r\nThe reason we're doing this in two parts is because we want to make the smallest change possible that can be merged without checking a lot of tests files as well.\r\n\r\nThis is the first step in getting the `master` branch in a `v3`-only state instead of a mixed state.\r\n\r\nNote: it could be that we get a bunch of Depfu related PRs to bump certain versions. There is a high chance that CI will start failing (especially around major version bumps). We also have to make sure to not bump certain dependencies (double check each failing depfu PR) so that we don't introduce breaking changes in v3.\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

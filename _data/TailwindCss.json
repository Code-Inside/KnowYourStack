Create a Next.js project with TailwindCSS.\r\n2. Add a file in a nested directory, for example `./components/ui/avatar.tsx`.\r\n3. In the TailwindCSS configuration file, add the path to the nested directory in the `content` array:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst config: Config = {\r\n  content: [\r\n    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',\r\n    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',\r\n    './modules/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',\r\n    './app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',\r\n  ],\r\n  // rest of the config\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Run the Next.js project.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior:\r\n\r\nTailwindCSS should process the `avatar.tsx` file and apply the necessary styles.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior:\r\n\r\nTailwindCSS does not process the `avatar.tsx` file. The styles are not applied.\r\n\r\n## Workaround:\r\n\r\nIf I add another file in the parent directory (`./components`) that contains an expression that needs to be processed by TailwindCSS, then the `avatar.tsx` file is processed. For example, if I add a `README.mdx` file in `./components` with the following content:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div className=\"grid-cols-[max-content,1fr]\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, and only then, the `avatar.tsx` file is processed by TailwindCSS.\r\n\r\n## Additional Information:\r\n\r\nThe `./components` directory only contains the `./components/ui` directory, which in turn only contains the `avatar.tsx` file. \r\nThis issue seems to be a bug in TailwindCSS's file processing logic. It appears that TailwindCSS does not process files in nested directories unless there is another file in the parent directory that requires processing. This behavior is unexpected and can lead to styles not being applied as intended.\r\n\r\n* Reproduction URL: https://github.com/zvictor/tailwind-bug-12755","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/12755","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"TailwindCSS Not Processing Files in Nested Directories Unless Another File in Parent Directory Requires Processing\" (#12755)"},{"Id":"2079552021","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-12T19:28:12","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"12754","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update vite 5.0.10 → 5.0.11 (patch)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

While we don’t use Tailwind to build Radix Themes itself, one of the goals we have is to provide a great experience for people using any styling technology for their custom styles, including Tailwind users. Ideally, this would “just work”. However, it doesn’t, and although workarounds exist, we found that the vast majority of people [struggle to debug this intuitively](https://github.com/radix-ui/themes/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atailwind).\r\n\r\nI also think that fixing this would improve the situation for everyone, as the scenario that my reproduction URL shows is very basic and plausible in many codebases where hand-rolled styles are used hand in hand with Tailwind.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/12734","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Button reset rule leads to specificity issues with custom CSS\" (#12734)"},{"Id":"2072176457","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T16:07:32","Actor":"adamwathan","Number":"12735","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ensure max specificity of 0,0,1 for button and input Preflight rules","State":"closed","Body":"Resolves #12734\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, Preflight contained a couple of attribute selectors which have a specificity of `0,1,0`:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n  button,\r\n+ [type='button'],\r\n+ [type='reset'],\r\n+ [type='submit'] {\r\n    -webkit-appearance: button; /* 1 */\r\n    background-color: transparent; /* 2 */\r\n    background-image: none; /* 2 */\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese have the same specificity as a class, and users often ran into situations where these rules were conflicting with custom classes in their own CSS, especially when importing CSS from other libraries like Material UI or Radix Themes.\r\n\r\nThe recommended solution has always been to order your imports based on which rules you want to take precedence, which is also what the [Radix team has been recommending](https://github.com/radix-ui/themes/issues/109#issuecomment-1747345743). Giving people control over the order of their CSS like this is the whole reason Tailwind has three separate groups of styles (base, components, and utilities) after all — if we didn't expect people to need/want to do this we'd just make it a single `@tailwind styles` rule or something.\r\n\r\nI still think it's important people understand how this sort of thing works in CSS or they'll inevitably run into other collisions when mixing multiple libraries, but this PR tries to make Preflight less order sensitive by reducing the specificity of the aforementioned rules to `0,0,1`:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n  button,\r\n+ input:where([type='button']),\r\n+ input:where([type='reset']),\r\n+ input:where([type='submit']) {\r\n    -webkit-appearance: button; /* 1 */\r\n    background-color: transparent; /* 2 */\r\n    background-image: none; /* 2 */\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could reduce the specificity to `0,0,0` using just `:where([type='button'])` but that feels a bit riskier to me as it introduces the potential for even `*` rules to override these rules if things were in the wrong order. Makes the most sense to me that all four selectors in this rule have the same specificity.\r\n\r\nThis change depends on `:where()` which is a somewhat modern CSS feature and one that didn't exist at the time Preflight was initially authored, but it's has Safari 14 support which feels good enough to me.\r\n\r\nThis problem is one of our [most active GitHub discussions](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/5969) so I think it's worth tweaking.\r\n\r\nIn the next major version of Tailwind we’ll be using real CSS layers which isolate all of their styles, so the specificity of rules in Preflight won’t matter at all.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/12735","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Ensure max specificity of 0,0,1 for button and input Preflight rules\" (#12735)"},{"Id":"2071418061","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-09T02:55:49","Actor":"tcolinpa","Number":"12731","RawContent":null,"Title":"Shadows get blocked by ring offset (even if ring-offset-transparent is set)","State":"closed","Body":"Reproduction URL: https://play.tailwindcss.com/M36yIyIMVp \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/44402590/4b9e3ec7-0f9b-4415-bded-029bd24d184f\r\n\r\nI made this bizarre demo just to see better, but if you use the `ring` utility to show focused elements, the ring offset will block the shadow... it doesn't work if I set `focus-visible:ring-offset-transparent` as well.\r\n\r\nI guess this could be solved by just inverting the order of the shadow-* utility from\r\n\r\n```\r\nbox-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow), var(--tw-ring-shadow), var(--tw-shadow, 0 0 #0000);\r\n```\r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n```\r\nbox-shadow: var(--tw-shadow), var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000), var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this is expected behavior, please ignore :)","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/12731","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Shadows get blocked by ring offset (even if ring-offset-transparent is set)\" (#12731)"},{"Id":"2068795361","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-06T19:49:04","Actor":"MohamedAli00949","Number":"12727","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix padding on small design","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

It reverts the change such that `darkMode: \"class\"` works the way it did in v3.3. This includes the difference in sorting.\r\n2.

This will result in `\\\\\\\\[` for example. In this case it means that the first `\\\\` is the path separator and the second `\\\\` is the escape for the `[` or `(` characters.\n\nAdditionally, we also ensure that we only escape `[`, `]` and `(`, `)` when the balanced pairs are _both_ not escaped yet. Right now it was going over the individual characters and escaping them accordingly.\n\nThis is not enough, because in case of this path:\n\n```js\nlet path = \".\\\\src\\\\**\\\\[foo]\\\\bar.html\"\n```\n\nThe first `\\\\[` looks like it is escaped, but on Windows this is just the path separator. The `foo]` part is _not_ escaped therefor we should escape the whole thing. As a first step, this will result in:\n\n```js\nlet path = \".\\\\src\\\\**\\\\\\\\[foo\\\\]\\\\bar.html\"\n```\n\nNow we do have the 4 backslashes `\\\\\\\\`, then in the normalization step, we normalize `\\\\` to `/`. If we do this _as is_, then it would look like this, which is also incorrect:\n\n```js\nlet path = \"./src/**/[foo/]/bar.html\"\n```\n\n... it's incorrect because we have `/[foo/]` and we expected `/\\\\[foo\\\\]` instead. \n\nIf we apply the logic I mentioned earlier where the first `\\\\` is the path separator and the second `\\\\` is the escape, then we can convert: \n\n```js\nlet path = \".\\\\src\\\\**\\\\\\\\[foo\\\\]\\\\bar.html\"\n``` \n\n... to this first: \n\n\n```js\nlet path = \".\\\\src\\\\**/\\\\[foo\\\\]\\\\bar.html\"\n```\n\nThen we can apply the rest of the normalization, which looks like this:\n\n```js\nlet path = \"./src/**/\\\\[foo\\\\]/bar.html\"\n```\n\n... and now the `[foo]` part is properly escaped as `\\\\[foo\\\\]`.\n\n<!--\n\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

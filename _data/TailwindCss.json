If you run the CLI from a different location than the current working directory you can get unexpected results.\r\n\r\nAs an example, let's say that your config says that your content files live under `./src/pages/**/*.js` and `./src/components/**.js`. If you run Tailwind CSS using `npx tailwindcss build …` from _inside_ the `src/` directory then Tailwind will complain about not being able to find any content paths. This doesn't make much sense because, to the user, the content is relative to the \"project root\" — which is almost always where their config file is.\r\n\r\nSo, we've added an option `content.relative` that lets you specify this behavior explicitly:\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  content: {\r\n    relative: true,\r\n    files: [\r\n      \"./src/pages/**/*.js\",\r\n      \"./src/components/**/*.js\",\r\n    ],\r\n  },\r\n  // …\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n> **Note**\r\n> Setting `content.relative` to `true` ensures that your **non-absolute paths** are resolved relative to the config file. You can also explicitly say that you don't want this behavior by setting it to `false`.\r\n\r\nThis will let you run Tailwind CSS from anywhere and it will resolve the file paths relative the location of the config file. If you do NOT use a config file (because you're passing an object, because you're using Nuxt with it's Tailwind CSS plugin, or some other third party solution) then the paths are resolved relative to the current working directory.\r\n\r\nThis is a change we intend to make the **default behavior in the future** for v4 — as such we've added a flag `future.relativeContentPathsByDefault` that enables this behavior by default. This allows you to keep using the `array` syntax for content paths instead of needing the object:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  future: {\r\n    relativeContentPathsByDefault: true,\r\n  },\r\n  content: [\r\n    \"./src/pages/**/*.js\",\r\n    \"./src/components/**/*.js\",\r\n  ],\r\n  // …\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes #6516","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/9396","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Allow resolving content paths relative to the config file\" (#9396)"},{"Id":"1383426148","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-23T10:44:37","Actor":"jinalptl1993","Number":"9401","RawContent":null,"Title":"TailwindCSS production mode is not including any decimal classes like py-2.5, py-3.5","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

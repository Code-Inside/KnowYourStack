I tried compiling Tailwind locally to see if I could bisect exactly what PR/ commit is causing it, but I'm not smart enough to get it all running in a local repo 😆 so this PR is my best guess at what's causing the issue.\n\nThe problem we are having is we have a blade component for the sidebar `<flux:sidebar />` and it looks something like this (simplified)\n\n```blade\n@php\nif ($sidebarIsStashable) {\n    $attributes = $attributes->merge([\n        'x-init' => '$el.classList.add(\\'-translate-x-full\\'); $el.classList.add(\\'transition-transform\\')',\n    ]);\n}\n@endphp\n\n<div x-data {{ $attributes->class('border-r w-64 p-4 min-h-dvh max-h-dvh top-0 fixed left-0') }}>\n    {{ $slot }}\n</div>\n```\n\nSince the changes in Tailwind v4.0.10, the styles `-translate-x-full` and `transition-transform` which are inside the conditionally added `x-init` are not being compiled by Tailwind and our sidebar is not being hidden.\n\nIf I add those classes in another file though (or somewhere else in this file), they get compiled correctly and our sidebar is being hidden as expected.\n\nI also experimented removing the backslashes from before the single quotes and everything works and compiles as expected.\n\n```php\n'x-init' => \"\\$el.classList.add('-translate-x-full'); \\$el.classList.add('transition-transform')\",\n```\n\nWould you have any thoughts as to what might be causing that? It's causing issues because the new Laravel Livewire starter kit is using Flux and people's sidebars aren't hiding 😅\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n_Originally posted by @joshhanley in https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16306#issuecomment-2706072709_\n            ","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17023","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Extractor issues in Livewire Flux\" (#17023)"},{"Id":"2902722020","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-07T11:19:01","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"17031","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ensure extracting candidates from JS embedded in a PHP string works as expected","State":"closed","Body":"This PR fixes an issue where candidates are not properly extractor when they end in `\\`.

We will now re-use the shared function so that it's all in one location.\r\nWe still check for a few additional characters such as `:` because of JS keys, `/` because it could be a start of a modifier and `!` because the named utility could be important.\r\n\r\nThis actually exposed a bug where the `class` attribute in `<div class=\"…\">…</div>` was not extracted (which we typically want). However, in languages like Svelte, this is a real thing you can do: `<div class:px-4=\"condition\"></div>`. The pre processor will make sure to convert this input to `<div class px-4=\"condition\"></div>` but that still means that we need to extract the `px-4`.\r\n\r\nif a utility ends in an number this worked as expected, but `<div class:flex=\"condition\"></div>` did not work. This PR also fixes that by adding a dedicated test and it's also the reason why you see a bunch of `class` candidates in the tests.\r\n\r\nFixes: #16999\r\n\r\n# Test plan\r\n\r\n1.

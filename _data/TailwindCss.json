The bug can be reproduced with the standalone Windows executable directly using the following steps.\n\n## Describe your issue\n\nThe Windows standalone Tailwind CSS CLI executable (tailwindcss-windows-x64.exe) exhibits inconsistent behavior **when run in an elevated (Administrator) terminal**. When called directly, it works as expected. When called via symlink (as created by WinGet installation), it shows Bun help output instead of Tailwind CSS functionality.\n\n**Important:** This issue ONLY occurs in elevated/administrator terminals. In normal user terminals, everything works correctly.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. **Open an elevated (Administrator) terminal**\n2. Install Tailwind CSS CLI via WinGet: `winget install TailwindLabs.TailwindCSS`\n3. Verify installation: `where tailwindcss` → Points to `C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WinGet\\Links\\tailwindcss.exe`\n4. Check symlink target: Points to `C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WinGet\\Packages\\TailwindLabs.TailwindCSS_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\tailwindcss.exe`\n\n### Elevation-specific behavior\n\n**In elevated terminal via symlink (INCORRECT):**\n```\n> tailwindcss --help\n```\nShows Bun help output:\n```\nBun is a fast JavaScript runtime, package manager, bundler, and test runner. (1.2.15+df017990a)\nUsage: bun <command> [...flags] [...args]\nCommands:\n  run, test, x, install, add, remove, etc.\n```\n\n**In elevated terminal direct invocation (CORRECT):**\n```\n> \"C:\\Users\\...\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\WinGet\\Packages\\TailwindLabs.TailwindCSS_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\tailwindcss.exe\" --help\n```\nShows proper Tailwind CSS help with options like --input, --output, --watch, --minify, etc.\n\n**In normal user terminal (ALL CORRECT):**\n- `tailwindcss --help` → Shows Tailwind CSS help properly\n- Direct path execution → Works correctly\n- All Tailwind-specific commands work as expected\n\n### Additional evidence\n\n- Even Tailwind-specific commands fail via symlink in elevated terminals: `tailwindcss --watch` and `tailwindcss --minify` both show Bun help\n- Same commands work correctly when called directly OR when run in normal user terminals\n- File verification: SHA256 hash `6631A41DE25A96EB8506F07B07AB56192DF117A29849C7D7A995BD343329E900` matches GitHub release\n- File size: ~131MB (suggesting Bun wrapper with embedded JavaScript)\n- Version shown: Bun v1.2.15 when invoked incorrectly\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe CLI should behave identically regardless of:\n1. Invocation method (direct path vs symlink)\n2. Terminal elevation status (normal vs administrator)\n\nWhen called as `tailwindcss --help` or `tailwindcss --watch`, it should show Tailwind CSS functionality in all contexts.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis affects users who need to run terminals with administrator privileges for various reasons (corporate policies, other tools requiring elevation, etc.). They cannot use `tailwindcss` commands naturally and must resort to typing the full executable path.\n\n### Technical analysis & potential root cause\n\nThe executable appears to have different behavior based on both invocation method AND privilege level. This suggests the issue might be in:\n\n1. **Bun's runtime detection logic** under elevated privileges - The Bun runtime may use different process/path detection when running as administrator\n2. **Windows symlink resolution** differences in elevated contexts\n3. **Security-related path resolution** that differs between normal and elevated terminals\n\n**Potential Bun packaging issue:** Given that the executable shows Bun v1.2.15 help when invoked via symlink IN ELEVATED TERMINALS ONLY, this appears to be a bug in Bun's executable packaging/runtime detection that manifests specifically under elevated privileges.\n\n**Recommendation:** This issue likely needs investigation from the Bun team, as it appears to be related to how Bun's runtime detects whether it should run in \"app mode\" vs \"runtime mode\" when executed with administrator privileges via symlink.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18695","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Windows CLI shows Bun help instead of Tailwind functionality when run in elevated/administrator terminal\" (#18695)"},{"Id":"3309822291","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-12T19:32:23","Actor":"btbrandon","Number":"18710","RawContent":null,"Title":"TailwindCSS styles not applied in Vite sandbox preview server","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\n3.4.4\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nremix-run/react 2.17.0, vite 6.0.0\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nv20.0.0\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nChrome\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nmacOS\n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\nhttps://github.com/btbrandon/sandbox-bug-reproduction\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nI’m running a Remix + Vite + TailwindCSS app inside my custom “sandbox” runner (an Express + Vite dev server that copies my project into /private/tmp/... and spins up Vite there).\n\nWhat I expected: Tailwind utility classes should be applied in the sandbox preview exactly the same as in my local IDE dev server or my production deploy.\n\nWhat actually happens: In the sandbox preview, none of my TailwindCSS classes take effect—layouts collapse, maps don’t render full-height, component styles are missing, etc.\n\nI get warnings even though the set up is correct:\n```\nwarn - The `content` option in your Tailwind CSS configuration is missing or empty.\nwarn - Configure your content sources or your generated CSS will be missing styles.\nwarn - https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration\n```\n\n**Linked issue from Vite**\nhttps://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/20553","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18710","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"TailwindCSS styles not applied in Vite sandbox preview server\" (#18710)"},{"Id":"3289944581","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-12T13:59:07","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"18669","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update all of react 19.1.0 → 19.1.1 (patch)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

The `addEventListener` case:\r\n\r\n   ```js\r\n   document.addEventListener('blur', handleBlur)\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   We do this by special casing the `addEventListener(` case and making sure the first argument to `addEventListener` is never migrated.\r\n\r\n2. A JavaScript variable with default value:\r\n\r\n   ```js\r\n   function foo({ foo = \"bar\", outline = true, baz = \"qux\" }) {\r\n     // ...\r\n   }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   The bug is relatively subtle here, but it has actually nothing to do with `outline` itself, but rather the fact that some quote character came before and after it on the same line...\r\n\r\n   One of our heuristics for determining if a migration on these small words is safe, is to ensure that the candidate is inside of a string. Since we didn't do any kind of quote balancing, we would consider the `outline` to be inside of a string, even though it is not.\r\n\r\n   So to actually solve this, we do some form of quote balancing to ensure that it's _not_ inside of a string in this case.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR also introduces a small refactor to the `is-safe-migration.test.ts` file where we now use a `test.each` to ensure that failing tests in the middle don't prevent the rest of the tests from running.\r\n\r\n### Test plan\r\n\r\n1. Added dedicated tests for the cases mentioned in the issue (#18675).\r\n2. Added a few more tests with various forms of whitespace.\r\n\r\nFixes: #18675\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18718","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix false-positive migrations in `addEventListener` and JavaScript variable names\" (#18718)"},{"Id":"3311763873","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-11T22:29:15","Actor":"Nness","Number":"18717","RawContent":null,"Title":"space-y-* or space-x-* incorrect behaviour on reverse","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

We're using Tailwind v4 in [Filament v4](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/tree/4.x) and have noticed nested CSS selectors using the `&` parent reference sometimes don't work properly when using Vite's dev server. This causes some styles to not render during development.\n\nProduction builds (i.e. the CSS generated by `npm run build`) work correctly. Also, using Lightning CSS directly as a transformer (`css: { transformer: 'lightningcss' }`) fixes the issue with the dev server, so I'm pretty sure this is specific to the Tailwind Vite plugin.\n\n## Environment\n- **Tailwind CSS version**: v4.1.4\n- **Vite version**: 6.2.4\n- **Framework**: Laravel 12 with Filament v4\n- **Node version**: 22\n- **PHP version**: 8.3\n\n## The Problem\n\nThe dev server fails to properly process `&` (parent references) when they appear in certain nested contexts eg.\n\n1. **With adjacent sibling selectors (`+`)**:\n```css\n/* From button.css - toggle button checked states */\ninput:checked + &label {\n    @apply bg-gray-400 text-white ring-0;\n}\n```\n\n2. **Inside `:not()` pseudo-classes**:\n```css\n/* From text.css - badge spacing in tables */\n&:not(.fi-ta-text-has-line-breaks) {\n    &.fi-ta-text-has-badges ul {\n        @apply flex gap-x-1.5;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n3. **In compound selectors**:\n```css\n/* From button.css - button borders */\n&:not(.fi-color),\n&label {\n    @apply ring-1 ring-gray-950/10;\n}\n```\n\nThe affected patterns can be found in Filament's core CSS:\n\nhttps://github.com/filamentphp/filament/blob/4.x/packages/support/resources/css/components/button.css\nhttps://github.com/filamentphp/filament/blob/4.x/packages/tables/resources/css/columns/text.css\n\nThese all work fine in production builds but the styles just don't get applied when using the dev server (unless using `lightningcss` as the transformer).\n\n## Reproduction Repository\n\nhttps://github.com/binaryfire/tailwind4-vite-dev-bug\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- PHP 8.3+ and Composer installed\n- Node.js 22+ and npm installed\n- Laravel development environment\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Clone the repo and run the setup:\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/binaryfire/tailwind4-vite-dev-bug.git\n\n   cd tailwind4-vite-dev-bug\n\n   ./setup.sh\n   ```\n\n2. **Test Scenario 1 - Production Build (Working)**:\n   ```bash\n   php artisan serve\n   ```\n   - Navigate to http://localhost:8000/admin\n   - Log in with `test@example.com` and `password`\n   - Visit the **Vite Dev Styles Bug** page\n   - You'll see:\n     - Action buttons have proper outlines\n     - Status toggle buttons change color when clicked\n   - Visit the **Tasks** page\n   - You'll see:\n     - Tags in the table are properly spaced\n\n<img width=\"1943\" height=\"1145\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b63e6cf-1b55-40aa-b892-937a83ac3ec4\" />\n\n<img width=\"2704\" height=\"1059\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9d6fdde-e1bc-43d6-90fc-87f3c318b88a\" />\n\n3. **Test Scenario 2 - Development Server (Broken)**:\n\n   **Important: clear browser cache first**\n\n   ```bash\n   composer run dev\n   ```\n   - Repeat the same steps\n   - You'll see:\n     - Action buttons have no outlines\n     - Status toggle buttons do not change color when clicked\n     - Tags in the Tasks table have no spacing between them\n\n<img width=\"1868\" height=\"1146\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef38ed5f-8a04-46d4-9ad2-85a548f1c3e9\" />\n\n<img width=\"2499\" height=\"1317\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb8c0c9a-bb15-4cc6-b29f-e8487addac3f\" />\n\n\n## Impact\n\nThis makes development pretty painful. We can't use hot module replacement effectively because a bunch of UI components (toggle buttons, badges, etc.) don't render properly. Developers have to either:\n1. Use `npm run build` locally (losing HMR)\n\n2. Maintain separate dev-only CSS overrides [like this](https://github.com/binaryfire/filament-vite-dev-fix/blob/main/resources/css/vite-dev-fix.css)\n\n3. Use Lightning CSS directly:\n\n```js\nexport default defineConfig({\n css: {\n   transformer: 'lightningcss',\n },\n});\n```\n(but I've seen a few threads which mention this can cause weirdness with purging).\n\nNone of these are ideal solutions.\n\n\n## Related Issues\n\n- https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/issues/16257","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18681","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Nested `&` selectors sometimes break in Vite dev server (Tailwind v4)\" (#18681)"},{"Id":"3293990405","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-05T18:07:24","Actor":"NishargShah","Number":"18678","RawContent":null,"Title":"Error: \"Parsing css source code failed\" in Tailwind V3","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

I also created a **minimal repo to reproduce the bug**.\n\n---\n\n### 🧩 What I Did\n\n1. In my `tailwind.config.ts`, I added a plugin to support custom padding values.\n\n2. In `page.tsx` at 7th line I used the class `!pt-1.25`.\n\n    Please take a note, it only reproduce when important (!) is there, without important it will work as aspected.\n\n3. Then I ran this command to generate CSS:\n\n   ```bash\n   npx tailwindcss -i ./src/styles/globals.css -o ./src/styles/output.css\n   ```\n\n4. When I start the Next.js dev server with `--turbopack`:\n\n   ```bash\n   next dev --turbopack\n   ```\n\n   I get a **Next.js error screen**, and the server fails to load the app.\n\n5. But if I **remove `!pt-1.25`**, everything works perfectly.\n\n6. Also, if I run the dev server **without `--turbopack`**, it works fine.\n\n---\n\n### 📸 Screenshots\n\n#### Error in CSS File:\n\n![Browser error screen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/652f3a15-50a9-4978-9799-891b9e41c0ce)\n\n#### Error from dev server:\n\n![Next.js error screen](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98117e36-8876-4de7-878c-b8a1ca40321d)\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 What I Tried\n\n* I thought it might be a **PostCSS issue**, but not sure.\n* After testing multiple cases, the **main issue is with custom value `1.25` and `--turbopack` in dev mode**.\n* This issue does **not** happen in production builds, only during dev with `--turbopack`.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Temporary Workaround\n\nIf I remove the `--turbopack` flag from the script, like this:\n\n```bash\nnext dev\n```\n\n…it works fine. But I prefer to use `--turbopack` for better speed.\n\n---\n\n### 📦 Possible Cause?\n\nIt might be that:\n\n* `1.25` is not being processed correctly in some part of the pipeline (maybe PostCSS or internal Tailwind logic).\n* Or maybe `--turbopack` in Next.js is strict and crashes when there CSS syntax error.\n\n---\n\nPlease check if:\n\n* This is a Tailwind bug or something from Next.js Turbo integration.\n* Any workaround/fix is possible for supporting custom values like `1.25`.\n\nThanks a lot for your great work and support 🙌\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18678","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Error: \"Parsing css source code failed\" in Tailwind V3\" (#18678)"},{"Id":"3290675570","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-08-04T20:23:17","Actor":"skyrisemax-affiliate","Number":"18670","RawContent":null,"Title":"Sky Rise Affiliate Marketing Website","State":"closed","Body":"`<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Sky Rise Affiliate Marketing - Discover the best products across all e-commerce platforms.

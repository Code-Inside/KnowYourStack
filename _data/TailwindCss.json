And on Windows, it would fix it again and create `mb-3 mt-5`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Update:**\r\nI debugged into this and came to the following result:\r\n* Linting on Linux:\r\nIn the `sortClassList(['mb-3', 'mt-5'], {...})` function, the `classNamesWithOrder` is set to this:\r\n![image](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/11340487/7b79f909-43a9-41d0-bcf2-c229affb6e6e)\r\n\r\n* Linting on Windows:\r\nIn the `sortClassList(['mb-3', 'mt-5'], {...})` function, the `classNamesWithOrder` is set to this:\r\n![image](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/11340487/13ad36bf-44c3-4d98-a12d-8cc05aa125f6)\r\n\r\nAs we can see, the numbers assigned to the classes differ and therefore, the order flips later in the code:\r\n* Class `mb-3` gets assigned `1n` on Linux and `3n` on Windows.\r\n* Class `mt-5` gets assigned `0n` on Linux and `4n` on Windows\r\n_Notice, `mb3` gets the higher value on Linux whereas `mt-5` gets the higher value on Windows._\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I did not manage to debug further down into this as I think the code relevant for this is `getClassOrder` https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/0060508c6e769346d10870abacc94c42852f497e/packages/tailwindcss/src/sort.ts#L4 and I did not have a non-minified build of tailwindcss v4.\r\n\r\nI guess the issue lies somewhere in the AST generation of `compileCandidates` ( https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/0060508c6e769346d10870abacc94c42852f497e/packages/tailwindcss/src/compile.ts#L8 ).\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\nhttps://github.com/sceee/tailwindcss-repro\r\n\r\nAction run that demonstrates the issue on Windows and Linux:\r\nhttps://github.com/sceee/tailwindcss-repro/actions/runs/8663153843\r\n\r\nOn the Ubuntu job, eslint emits the lint warning (to swap the class order) whereas on Windows, no warning is emitted.\r\n\r\nI opened this issue here in the `tailwindcss` repository as I think the issue lies in the `compileCandidates` code that is in this repository (instead of prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13516","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Prettier Plugin] v4 Different `prettier/prettier` eslint rule sorting behavior and results on Windows and Linux emitting warnings on the other OS\" (#13516)"},{"Id":"2238764988","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-11T23:50:23","Actor":"traderift","Number":"13508","RawContent":null,"Title":"Talwind 4 alpha firefox space-x issues","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

However, once a number is reached the numbers are compared as actual numbers instead of their string representation.\r\n\r\nBefore this change, `p-1 p-2 p-10 p-20` would be sorted as `p-1 p-10 p-2 p-20`. After this change, the order is `p-1 p-2 p-10 p-20`.\r\n\r\nThis makes the suggestions in the vscode extension more logical.\r\n\r\nThe implementation compares two strings, and as long as the strings don't contain any numbers, it compares them as strings. This way we don't pay a performance penalty for comparing strings that don't contain numbers.\r\n\r\nTesting this change on the `tailwindcss.com` codebase where we have to store `~3200` unique classes the time spend on sorting the classes went from `~2.35ms` to ~~`~3.29ms`~~`~3.10ms`. This means that there is about a ~~`~1ms`~~`~0.75ms` performance penalty for sorting this.\r\n\r\nAnother thing we could have done is to compare using the `localeCompare` method:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction compare(a, b) {\r\n  return a.localeCompare(b, undefined, { numeric: true });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this is an order of magnitude slower than the current implementation, and sorting takes around `~30ms` instead.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOutstanding questions:\r\n\r\n1. We could _only_ do this for the VS Code extension and Prettier plugin because then we wouldn't have to pay the performance penalty of ~~`~1ms`~~`~0.75ms`. This however means that the order in the extension or the Prettier plugin would be different compared to the order in the generated CSS. Should we only do it there or everywhere and pay the ~~`~1ms`~~`~0.75ms` penalty in favor of nicer consistency?\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

They are almost always the very first element, or first few elements, and in those situations this new implementation has the same behavior as the old implementation.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe \"between\" styling that we do with `space-*` and `divide-*` is most commonly achieved in CSS with the \"lobotomized owl selector\", like this:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.space-y-4 > * + * {\r\n  margin-top: 1rem;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur implementation in Tailwind though has always used selectors that look like this:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.space-y-4 > :not([hidden]) ~ :not([hidden]) {\r\n  margin-top: 1rem;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPretty much the only reason we did this was so that you could use these utilities with [`x-for` in Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/directives/for)\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<ul class=\"space-y-4\" x-data=\"{ colors: ['Red', 'Orange', 'Yellow'] }\">\r\n  <template x-for=\"color in colors\">\r\n    <li x-text=\"color\"></li>\r\n  </template>\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlpine leaves that `<template>` tag in the DOM, which means the first `<li>` is actually the second child of the `<ul>`, and receives the \"between\" styling even when it shouldn't:\r\n\r\nhttps://play.tailwindcss.com/7q6MiKZnRg\r\n\r\nBy using the implementation we've used up until now, Alpine users could throw the `hidden` attribute on their `<template>` element and now the \"between\" styling would only show up where it's supposed to:\r\n\r\nhttps://play.tailwindcss.com/p6ZGpSw1zt\r\n\r\nThe problem is on pages with a lot of DOM nodes, the selector we use is _fucking_ slow 😄\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/cramforce/status/1774847095171862943\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/4323180/2e7c3f55-d475-41ef-9029-60102861d65b)\r\n\r\nIt's not just \"technically slow but you can't actually tell because it's still fast\" either — if you have a really big list or table or something it's very, very noticeable:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/13445\r\n\r\nThe new implementation introduced in this PR is almost 2000x faster, getting things back down to \"feels as fast as any other normal selector\" speeds.\r\n\r\nOne nice benefit of the new implementation is that you don't need to use the `hidden` attribute on `template` tags anymore — the \"between\" styling just works as expected without it because the `template` tag is receiving a `margin-bottom` for example but the entire element is hidden so that margin isn't actually rendered in the browser anyways.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/13459","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Don't accommodate hidden elements in space/divide\" (#13459)"},{"Id":"2232317369","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-09T15:37:56","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"13478","RawContent":null,"Title":"Invert variant order application","State":"closed","Body":"This PR can be a breaking change, but it will make the order of variants more intuitive.

MultiTool for Tailwind CSS ([github](https://github.com/brandonmcconnell/tailwindcss-multitool) | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss-multitool))\r\n\r\nMy MultiTool for Tailwind CSS plugin breaks when it contains a string including the `:` symbol, likely due to the parser terminating/splitting variants when it encounters the `:` symbol.\r\n\r\nI've done some testing, and this doesn't appear to be something my plugin can account for internally. If you look at the reproduction URL linked above ([also here](https://play.tailwindcss.com/T6ELlblWLw)), the first two lines receive the expected styles, but the last breaks entirely if it contains that character.\r\n\r\nThe problematic instances (those that contain `:`) don't appear to trigger the plugin and are likely seen as erroneous since, assuming my guesses here are correct, a usage like `multi-[underline;hover:font-bold]` would be split into `:multi-[underline;hover` and `font-bold]`.\r\n\r\nWith some slight tweaking to the parser, values could whitelist any instances of `:` within brackets.\r\n* current: `'a:b:[c:d]:e'` ➞ `['a', 'b', '[c', 'd]', 'e']`\r\n* desired: `'a:b:[c:d]:e'` ➞ `['a', 'b', '[c:d]', 'e']`\r\n\r\nIt's also important to note here that this was not always the case, or at least I am convinced it is not, as I include this example in the plugin's README, which worked when I tested it before including it in the README:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"sm:[&>div]:hover:active:multi-[font-bold;text-[red];[font-family:'Open_Sans',sans-serif]]\">\r\n  When hovered, this text will appear bold, red, and in Open Sans font.\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven a more `:`-riddled nested variant should be perfectly fine:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"hover:multi-[[&:is(*)]:focus:underline;[--some-var:{whatever}]]\">…</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. JS Tool for Tailwind CSS ([github](https://github.com/brandonmcconnell/tailwindcss-jstool) | [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss-jstool))\r\n\r\nWithout rehashing many of the same points I did above, if you take a look at this Tailwind Play example linked above ([also here](https://play.tailwindcss.com/ZID1xrVAra)), you'll see many examples I use to showcase how JS can expose specific values to Tailwind CSS using plugins. Admittedly, I seldom use this one, but it is nice sometimes when I need to break glass and expose JSON values to CSS while testing. I could expose them as CSS variables alternatively, but it's helpful to have some means to directly interface with raw data like this, even if only used on occasion.\r\n\r\nHere are those same examples from the linked Tailwind Play example, all of which previously worked:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"before:js-[content-['fontSize.2xl_===_#{theme('fontSize.2xl')}']]\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"before:js-[content-['the_registered_config_keys_are_#{Object.keys(config()).join(',_')}']]\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"before:js-[content-['A_random_digit_is_#{randomDigit()}']]\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"js-[[--random-color:#{randomColor()}]] js-[[--random-color-2:#{randomColor()}]] text-[--random-color] font-semibold [text-shadow:1px_2px_0_var(--random-color-2)]\">Random_colors_ftw!</div>\r\n<div class=\"js-[[--random-length:#{randomRange(16,22)}px]] text-[length:--random-length]\">Random sizes too 🤯</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn both of these examples, I'm primarily addressing how these regressions limit plugin authors from achieving some of the powerful tasks plugins were formerly able to perform.\r\n\r\nBoth of these plugins may seem to operate unconventionally, but that's why they're plugins. This is part of what excites a community like this one—testing the limits of a technology like Tailwind CSS, finding various ways it can be extended to achieve different tasks, and ultimately building within those limits to make someone else's work easier.\r\n\r\nI've heard from real users of my plugins how my tools have improved their experience building with Tailwind CSS, and I would hate to discontinue some of them due to breaking changes.\r\n\r\nEven this past week, I've been prepping content for a blog post or video—perhaps both—on the powerful ways Tailwind CSS plugins supercharge the developer experience, demonstrating examples and providing a crash course on how to build effective plugins.\r\n\r\n\"The power of JavaScript in the simple and familiar form factor of Tailwind CSS utilities.\" (still bikeshedding the name)\r\n\r\nBecause many people primarily associate Tailwind CSS with CSS (for obvious reasons), they miss that with plugins, we can interject all sorts of sophisticated and useful functionality into our utilities. Plugins are essentially middleware that allow us to bridge the parser/compiler to our frontend in dynamic and performant ways, leveraging build-time processing.\r\n\r\nMany things that are not yet possible in pure CSS **_are_** possible with Tailwind CSS because of this JS processing, so it acts more like mixins and functions than just variable interpolation.\r\n\r\nThat said, it would be helpful to use examples like these to demonstrate the flexibility of Tailwind CSS plugins.

The only solution I've found here is to _not_ reference the `--shadow-sm` variable in the `.shadow-sm` class, to make sure the value of `--tw-shadow-color` on the current element is respected, rather than looking for the value of `--tw-shadow-color` where `--shadow-sm` is defined:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n  :root {\r\n    --shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px 0 var(--tw-shadow-color, black);\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  .shadow-sm {\r\n-   box-shadow: var(--shadow-sm, 0 1px 2px 0 var(--tw-shadow-color, black));\r\n+   box-shadow: 0 1px 2px 0 var(--tw-shadow-color, black);\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  .shadow-blue {\r\n    --tw-shadow-color: blue;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is pretty unfortunate because now our box shadow utilities behave subtly differently than every other utility in the framework. I'm hoping we can find some trick to make these variables lazily evaluated, and [tweeted about it](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1775937299919859961) in case someone else out there has any ideas.\r\n\r\nFor now though we should merge this to effectively selectively revert https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/13177 for the affected utilities.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/13449","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Don't read variables for shadow sizes\" (#13449)"},{"Id":"2225797897","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-04T15:43:02","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"13448","RawContent":null,"Title":"Prepare next release: `4.0.0-alpha.12`","State":"closed","Body":"This PR prepares the release of `4.0.0-alpha.12`\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

We have built the same layout using two screens: one utilizing Next.js + Tailwind CSS and the other using Next.js + normal CSS. The issue only manifests in the repository where Tailwind CSS is used. Additionally, this problem is not reproducible on all devices. I am sharing a screen recording of the issue and device information.\r\nNote: The cluttered layout issue is not limited to the SVG teeth chart; it is randomly occurring on all elements. Additionally, this problem is not confined to this specific page; it is happening on all other pages as well. We are just sharing a sample page link for demonstration purposes.\r\n\r\n- Device details:\r\nDevice: OnePlus Nord CE2 (IV2201)\r\nAndroid Version: 13 (Oxygen OS 13)\r\nScreen Size: 6.43 inches\r\nBrowser: Chrome 122.0.6261.90\r\nWe have attempted to connect the Chrome debugger tool to inspect the mobile code. However, in the DOM, the cluttered layout changes are not reflected. Furthermore, since this issue is limited to very few devices, it is proving to be quite challenging to debug. Additionally, we have tried removing the teeth chart and other elements that frequently exhibit the cluttered layout, but the issue persists in other elements.\r\n<img width=\"295\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-05 at 7 49 48 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/10258164/d6de3a9d-7658-4665-ad45-91f40d2eae6d\">\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13083","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"cluttered layout on quick scroll or any update on page (Only on some Mobile device)\" (#13083)"},{"Id":"2166982831","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-04T19:17:50","Actor":"ahmedsayedabdelsalam","Number":"13077","RawContent":null,"Title":"rounded-full on one side removes the round from the other side","State":"closed","Body":"when i try to make rounded-t-full it removes the style of rounded-b-lg  [playground](https://play.tailwindcss.com/vQXmeVqie9?layout=horizontal)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/29691074/f5eb86e1-56ef-4fc6-a7a7-78b36844db2d\" width=\"500\" />","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13077","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"rounded-full on one side removes the round from the other side\" (#13077)"},{"Id":"2161170918","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-01T20:42:14","Actor":"kolaente","Number":"13060","RawContent":null,"Title":"Important selector does not modify ","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\n3.4.1\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\nSvelte 4.2.8 / Vite 5.0.8\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\n\r\nFirefox / Chrome\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\n\r\nNixOS\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\n\r\nhttps://play.tailwindcss.com/J68KhTQ5z0\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nI'm building a widget which gets embedded into other websites. These websites may have other style classes set which then override Tailwind's class names. Like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.p-4 {\r\n  padding: 4rem !important;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Yes, they have set their utility classes with `!important`)\r\n\r\nI'm using Tailwind's [important selector](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration#selector-strategy) in my config. This works as long as the main website stylesheet does not use `!important` in their interfering class names. Once they do, their styles are more important than mine. I can't change their styles.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I'd love a way to set a selector _and_ apply the `!important` modifier to all styles at the same time. That way, I won't override the website's styles and they won't override mine. I know I can add `!` to all classes, but that's a bit tedious and will be one more thing I need to think about while building this.\r\n\r\nMaybe similar to https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/11331","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13060","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Important selector does not modify \" (#13060)"},{"Id":"2163262781","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-01T13:42:16","Actor":"ajaythakkar","Number":"13066","RawContent":null,"Title":"DarkMode is not working on production","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\nv3.0.7\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\nNuxtJs 3.7\r\n\r\nI am using:\r\ndarkMode: 'class',\r\n\r\nI have tried all the ways suggested in the past but it is not working.\r\n\r\nsafelist: ['dark'],\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13066","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"DarkMode is not working on production\" (#13066)"},{"Id":"2162805039","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-01T07:42:55","Actor":"FJLendinez","Number":"13063","RawContent":null,"Title":"Extending animation doesn't work using standalone CLI","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

This leads to styling not being applied for max breakpoints, and no way for the dev to know unless it's visually noticeable in the browser.\r\n\r\nAs I had trouble figuring out where the max-* classes were defined while trying to identify the bug, once I remembered that they were auto-generated (tucked away in the docs [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#targeting-a-breakpoint-range)), I just explicitly defined these in the config as well. It's easier, then, to trace for any other devs unfamiliar with TW.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  sm: '400px',\r\n  md: '612px',\r\n  lg: '768px',\r\n  xl: '1024px',\r\n\r\n  'max-sm': { max: '399px'},\r\n  'max-md':  { max: '611px'},\r\n  'max-lg':  { max: '767px'},\r\n  'max-xl':  { max: '1023px'},\r\n\r\n  // This now has no impact on the max-* classes as we define them above\r\n  'has-hover': { raw: '(hover: hover)' },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this the expected behaviour? Should there be more notice when the max-* classes aren't successfully generated? Should docs surrounding the max-* classes be easier to find, or added to the screens section? Quick search is no help, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThanks!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13022","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Adding non-pixel media queries to screens config prevents auto-generated max-* classes for the rest of the breakpoints\" (#13022)"},{"Id":"2152388269","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-24T22:47:57","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"13020","RawContent":null,"Title":"🚨 [security] Update vite 4.3.2 → 5.1.4 (major)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n<hr>\n\n🚨 <b>Your current dependencies have known security vulnerabilities</b> 🚨\n\nThis dependency update fixes known security vulnerabilities.

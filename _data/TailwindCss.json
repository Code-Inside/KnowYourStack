This compatibility is crucial for maintaining our project's code formatting standards and utility functionality.\r\n\r\n### Affected Plugins\r\n- `@softonus/prettier-plugin-duplicate-remover`\r\n- `@softonus/prettier-plugin-whitespace-remover`\r\n\r\n### Desired Outcome\r\nThe desired outcome is for these plugins to function correctly when placed before the Tailwind CSS plugin in the Prettier configuration file. This would allow for better flexibility in managing code formatting and style consistency.\r\n\r\n### Current Behavior\r\n- When these plugins are placed before the Tailwind plugin: They do not function as expected.\r\n- When placed after the Tailwind plugin: They lead to the Tailwind plugin being disabled.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Set up a project with Prettier and Tailwind CSS.\r\n2. Install and configure the aforementioned plugins in the `.prettierrc` file.\r\n3. Arrange the plugins before the Tailwind CSS plugin and attempt to format the files.\r\n4. Observe the lack of expected functionality from the plugins.\r\n\r\n### Suggested Solution\r\nInvestigate potential changes or enhancements in the plugin architecture or initialization sequence that would allow these plugins to operate effectively when configured before the Tailwind CSS plugin. This might involve modifications to how plugins are loaded or processed by Prettier when working with CSS frameworks like Tailwind.\r\n\r\n### Beneficial Side Effect:\r\nImplementing this change will also have the added advantage of negating the need for the Tailwind plugin to include its own duplicate and whitespace remover functionalities. This would not only streamline the Tailwind plugin but also reduce redundancy and potential conflicts between these utilities.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate your consideration and any efforts to enhance the compatibility of these tools, which are crucial for our development workflows.\r\n\r\nThey should be added to this file: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss/blob/3c9ce4e488c09851be1d5be37940b39679e10c1c/src/plugins.js#L174\r\n\r\n``` let plugins = [\r\n    '@ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports',\r\n    '@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports',\r\n    'prettier-plugin-organize-imports',\r\n    'prettier-plugin-css-order',\r\n    'prettier-plugin-import-sort',\r\n    'prettier-plugin-jsdoc',\r\n    'prettier-plugin-organize-attributes',\r\n    'prettier-plugin-style-order',\r\n    'prettier-plugin-sort-imports',\r\n    '@softonus/prettier-plugin-whitespace-remover',   // <- this one\r\n    '@softonus/prettier-plugin-duplicate-remover'   // and this one\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n</div>","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13708","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Prettier Plugin] Handle two more plugins\" (#13708)"},{"Id":"2325399004","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-30T11:17:01","Actor":"barvian","Number":"13766","RawContent":null,"Title":"Tailwind Play and Play CDN don't work with some custom utilities","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

When I run `npx @tailwindcss/upgrade\" to upgrade my app from v3 to v4, it deletes every file in my project tree.  Not just CSS files, but literally every file.\n\nSpecifically, it happens during the \"Migrating templates...\" step.  Originally, it looked like it was hung, but when I killed the process, I checked my git tree and thousands of files had been deleted.  Thankfully, I had run a commit right before I ran the updater so I could revert without issue, but I suspect this is not expected behaviour.\n\nIn this example, I show that there are no changes to be made, I run the upgrader, and then it's showing all of these files having been deleted (it would delete more if I didn't `CTRL-C` out of the upgrader).\n\n```sh\n2:36:03 PM in ipms on  filament-v4-upgrade via 🥟 v1.2.22 via  v8.4.12\n⚡️? 78% ➜ git status\nOn branch filament-v4-upgrade\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n\n2:36:05 PM in ipms on  filament-v4-upgrade via 🥟 v1.2.22 via  v8.4.12\n⚡️? 78% ➜ npx @tailwindcss/upgrade\n≈ tailwindcss v4.1.13\n\n│ Searching for CSS files in the current directory and its subdirectories…\n\n│ Migrating stylesheets…\n\n│ ↳ Migrated stylesheet: `./resources/css/app.css`\n\n│ Updating dependencies…\n\n│ ↳ Updated package: `tailwindcss`\n\n│ ↳ Updated package: `@tailwindcss/postcss`\n\n│ ↳ Updated package: `@tailwindcss/vite`\n\n│ ↳ Updated package: `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss`\n\n│ Migrating templates…\n\n^C\n\n2:36:17 PM in ipms on  filament-v4-upgrade [!] via 🥟 v1.2.22 via  v8.4.12 took 8s\n⚡️? 78% ➜ git status\nOn branch filament-v4-upgrade\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use \"git add <file>...\" to update what will be committed)\n  (use \"git restore <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n        modified:   .editorconfig\n        modified:   README.md\n        modified:   _ide_helper_models.php\n        modified:   app/Casts/Markdown.php\n        modified:   app/Console/Commands/AddDuesToAllCommand.php\n        modified:   app/Console/Commands/AddInstructionalVideosCommand.php\n        modified:   app/Console/Commands/ImportContest2024Command.php\n        modified:   app/Console/Commands/ImportMembersCommand.php\n        modified:   app/Console/Commands/MigrateDbEngineCommand.php\n        modified:   app/Enums/ClassifiedAdContactType.php\n        modified:   app/Enums/ClassifiedAdType.php\n        modified:   app/Enums/Config/DuesFrequency.php\n        modified:   app/Enums/ContestEntryAgeClass.php\n        modified:   app/Enums/ContestEntryRanking.php\n        modified:   app/Enums/ExternalMembershipOrganization.php\n        modified:   app/Enums/InstructionalVideoPanel.php\n\nno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")\n\n2:36:19 PM in ipms on  filament-v4-upgrade [!] via 🥟 v1.2.22 via  v8.4.12\n⚡️? 78% ➜\n```\n\nI'm not really sure what else to do.

Plus characters in utility names used to work in v3 but no longer work in v4. Plus characters appear to work if I use the new CSS method of defining utilites, however I cannot use pure CSS for my configuration because my theme contains complex stuff that requires TypeScript (not shown in my minimal reproduction).\n\nExample: notice sm+ isn't showing up in Intellisense.\n\n<img width=\"770\" height=\"748\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3556cefb-8017-4028-a678-e53e575ead0a\" />\n\n<img width=\"1740\" height=\"678\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ec73bd3-311d-4282-8f1e-298c61e6275d\" />","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18930","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Plus character in utility name doesn't work when defined in TypeScript configuration file\" (#18930)"},{"Id":"3420002549","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-16T08:54:11","Actor":"boycce","Number":"18942","RawContent":null,"Title":"optimizeUniversalDefaults should be a primary setting","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

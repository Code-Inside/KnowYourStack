We are not interested in the dependencies that are listed in your `package.json` and thus in your `node_modules` folder.\n\nWe made the assumption that your imports have at least 3 characters. This sort of makes sense because there will be a `.`, then the OS separator like `/` and than a file name. E.g.: `./a` is the minimal amount of characters.\n\nThis makes sense for `import` statements, but in the case of `require`, it is totally valid to write `require('.')`. This will require the current `index.{js,ts,mjs,cjs,...}` in the current directory.\n\nBefore this change, having a `require('.')` wouldn't crash, but the dependency would not be marked as a module dependencies and therefore we won't listen for file changes for that dependency.\n\n<!--\n\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

This release temporarily adds back support so that the latest Sass version that declares it supports Node 12 actually does so. However, Node 12 is now end-of-life, so we will drop support for it properly in an upcoming release.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">See the <a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1593\">full changelog</a> for changes in earlier releases.</p></blockquote>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.59.2\">1.59.2</a></h4>\n\n<blockquote><p dir=\"auto\">To install Sass 1.59.2, download one of the packages below and <a href=\"https://katiek2.github.io/path-doc/\">add it to your PATH</a>, or see <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/install\">the Sass website</a> for full installation instructions.</p>\n<h1 dir=\"auto\">Changes</h1>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>No user-visible changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">See the <a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1592\">full changelog</a> for changes in earlier releases.</p></blockquote>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.59.1\">1.59.1</a></h4>\n\n<blockquote><p dir=\"auto\">To install Sass 1.59.1, download one of the packages below and <a href=\"https://katiek2.github.io/path-doc/\">add it to your PATH</a>, or see <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/install\">the Sass website</a> for full installation instructions.</p>\n<h1 dir=\"auto\">Changes</h1>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>No user-visible changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"auto\">See the <a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1591\">full changelog</a> for changes in earlier releases.</p></blockquote>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.59.0\">1.59.0</a></h4>\n\n<blockquote><p dir=\"auto\">To install Sass 1.59.0, download one of the packages below and <a href=\"https://katiek2.github.io/path-doc/\">add it to your PATH</a>, or see <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/install\">the Sass website</a> for full installation instructions.</p>\n<h1 dir=\"auto\">Changes</h1>\n<h3 dir=\"auto\">Command Line Interface</h3>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Added a new <code class=\"notranslate\">--fatal-deprecation</code> flag that lets you treat a deprecation warning as an error.

We recently upgraded to v2.2 from v2.1 (yes, we're very behind... ðŸ˜…) and encountered this issue that is also present in the latest release.\r\n\r\nAt least in v2.2.19 and v3.4.1 the `animation-name` property is being incorrectly parsed, resulting in the matching `keyframes` being excluded from the CSS output.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be parseAnimationValue, which is confusing a `var(...)` for the animation name. Then the JIT presumably excludes the \"unused\" keyframes.\r\n\r\nIt's straightforward to verify that that the output is incorrect (this is v2.2, but the same is true for v3):\r\n\r\n```\r\nnode -p \"require('tailwindcss/lib/util/parseAnimationValue').default('slide-x var(--slide-duration) linear 0s 1 forwards')\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1052\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/90831/d8eeff41-e366-46a8-8407-0eaf7be0123e\">\r\n\r\n(`name` is incorrect)\r\n\r\nNote that a real browser / CSS parser has no trouble discerning which of the values is actually the name, as shown by this JSFiddle! https://jsfiddle.net/kirbysayshi/6nkpe8yw/\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to put the animation name last, but this goes against the guidelines from MDN (which I'm sure everyone's aware of, given some comments I see in parseAnimationValue tests!):\r\n\r\n> If a value in the animation shorthand can be parsed as a value for an animation property other than animation-name, then the value will be applied to that property first and not to animation-name. For this reason, the recommended practice is to specify a value for animation-name as _the last value in a list of values_ when using the animation shorthand; \r\n\r\n(emphasis mine) from : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation#description\r\n\r\nRelated:\r\n- https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/4737\r\n- https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/5602\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13208","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"animation property using `var()` has the wrong name, keyframes are excluded and animation is broken\" (#13208)"},{"Id":"2177723711","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-11T20:58:56","Actor":"coolemur","Number":"13185","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] pseudo element content is applied on hover when it shouldn't ","State":"closed","Body":"https://play.tailwindcss.com/GdvdL0CtyR\r\n\r\nIn v3 this doesn't have after:content when hovered\r\nIn v4 this does have after:content when hovered\r\n\r\n<img width=\"369\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-03-10 at 14 34 27\" src=\"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/29693103/359bc38e-ea8c-4a22-b754-287f230fc875\">\r\n\r\nAnd this element doesn't even have something like `after:content-['']` applied at all, so after pseudo element isn't expected to be visible at all.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13185","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[v4] pseudo element content is applied on hover when it shouldn't \" (#13185)"},{"Id":"2179808148","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-11T19:31:47","Actor":"antonijo01","Number":"13202","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unknown at rule @theme in style.css","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\nv4-alpha\r\n\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\n\r\nVSCode\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\nNode v21.0.0.\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\n\r\nChrome\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\n\r\nWindows\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\n\r\nlocalhost\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nAfter installing via CLI, I tried to add @theme to style.css and got an error.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/107608985/f9cbc3d4-b14d-4a6e-8f85-3da5163d9de0)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13202","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Unknown at rule @theme in style.css\" (#13202)"},{"Id":"2179997243","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-11T19:10:22","Actor":"adamwathan","Number":"13203","RawContent":null,"Title":"Prepare alpha.8 release","State":"closed","Body":"Updates versions and changelog for alpha.8 release.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/13203","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Prepare alpha.8 release\" (#13203)"},{"Id":"2176949177","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-11T19:01:28","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"13170","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add incremental rebuilds to `@tailwindcss/postcss`","State":"closed","Body":"This PR makes use of the new `compile` APIs for incremental rebuilds in the `@tailwindcss/postcss` package.\n\nRelies on: #13168\n<!--\n\nðŸ‘‹ Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

In case you want to run a full build again (e.g.: when a CSS file changed), then you can call the `compile` function again.\r\n\r\nAll potential caches are scoped to the `compile` function, which means that if you call `compile` again, you will get a fresh instance (and the old caches can be garbage collected).\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduces more dedicated methods on the internal `DesignSystem` for parsing candidates, parsing variants and compiling AST nodes from candidates.\r\n\r\nAll these methods are behind caches, so we don't do unnecessary work and re-use everything as much as possible.

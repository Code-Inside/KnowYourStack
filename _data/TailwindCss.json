We're a small team and without all of this information it's not possible for us to help and your bug report will be closed. -->\n\n**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\n4.1.11\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nNext.js 15.4.3, npm 10.8.1\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nv22.4.0\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nChrome\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nWindows\n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\nSince this is a upgrade issue I don't have a reproduction URL.\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nI upgraded my project from v3 to v4 using the official [upgrade documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide). Everything went fairly okay, no need to dive too deep into it.\n\nThe actual issue I have (which caused things to not work properly) is that the `content` field from `tailwind.config.ts` was not properly migrated to my `globals.css` file. I'm having a monorepo, but the example would give you more clarity:\n\n```ts\n// root/apps/web/tailwind.config.ts\nconst config: Config = {\n  darkMode: ['class'],\n  content: [\n    // more here, it's a big and complex monorepo, but the example will make it clear\n    './node_modules/@heroui/theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n  ],\n```\n\nSince I'm using Next.js, `tailwind.config.ts` is inside `root/apps/web/` (my web app), which has a tailwind dependency. And it makes sense, since heroui is installed inside `root/apps/web/node_modules`.\n\nThen, after the upgrade, I get this:\n\n```css\n/* root/apps/web/src/ui/styles/globals.css */\n@source '../../../../../node_modules/@heroui/theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}';\n```\n\nIt took me some time to figure out why this wasn't working 😊 \n\nAll of this makes sense, as the dir seems relative to root. That's where I executed the upgrade script from, because I am having multiple tailwind related apps/packages. But the result does not take in consideration where the actual tailwind config was, so that it can figure out the appropriate location.\n\nI'm sorry if this is confusing or there's something else off, but it's pretty hard for me to reproduce the same issue again 😊 \n\nThanks!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18603","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Content to source upgrade issue\" (#18603)"},{"Id":"3258821612","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-24T07:25:04","Actor":"shidfabics-netizen","Number":"18600","RawContent":null,"Title":"tzah","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

This can cause problems, as you can see in the example below:\n\nWe have a SvelteKit app.\n\nThis is the `vite.config.ts`:\n\n```ts\nimport { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite';\nimport tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [tailwindcss(), sveltekit()]\n});\n```\n\nIn our `app.css` we have some gradient stops for the primary color.\n\n```css\n@theme inline {\n  /* Common Tailwind gradient stops for primary color */\n  --color-primary-50: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 7%, hsl(193deg 100% 100%) 93%);\n  --color-primary-100: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 20%, hsl(193deg 100% 100%) 80%);\n  --color-primary-200: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 40%, hsl(193deg 100% 100%) 60%);\n  --color-primary-300: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 60%, hsl(193deg 100% 100%) 40%);\n  --color-primary-400: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 80%, hsl(193deg 100% 100%) 20%);\n  --color-primary-500: var(--primary);\n  --color-primary-600: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 90%, hsl(193deg 0% 0%) 10%);\n  --color-primary-700: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 78%, hsl(193deg 0% 0%) 22%);\n  --color-primary-800: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 65%, hsl(193deg 0% 0%) 35%);\n  --color-primary-900: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 50%, hsl(193deg 0% 0%) 50%);\n  --color-primary-950: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 35%, hsl(193deg 0% 0%) 65%);\n}\n```\n\nWith this we can use gradient stops for the primary color the same way as with the default Tailwind colors.\n\nWhen I use the class `border-primary-200`, I get this code in my dev environment:\n\n```css\n.border-primary-200 {\n    @supports (color: color-mix(in lab, red, red)) {\n        border-color: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 40%, hsl(193deg 100% 100%) 60%);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhich looks as expected:\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bae57fd-066e-4439-b1c2-8374879b4563)\n\nBut in the prod environment the `color-mix` doesn't work correctly anymore:\n\n```css\n@supports (color:color-mix(in lab,red,red)) {\n    .border-primary-200 {\n        border-color: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 40%, #fff 60%);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see the border color for the box in the center looks different:\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd60d073-c92c-47cc-af42-26f3a9840a4f)\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18591","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Vite plugin converts HSL and RGB colors to HEX during build\" (#18591)"},{"Id":"3244021302","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-21T19:39:35","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"18571","RawContent":null,"Title":"Don’t output CSS objects with `false` or `undefined` in the AST","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography/issues/384\r\n\r\nBasically when addUtilities/addComponents/matchUtilities/matchComponents saw a value of `false` it was being output instead of being discarded like it was in v3.\r\n\r\nThe types really require these to be strings but for things like the typography plugin this isn't really carried through from its theme config so it was easy to put anything in there and not realize it doesn't match the expected types.\r\n\r\nBasically this:\r\n```js\r\naddUtilities({\r\n  '.foo': {\r\n    a: 'red',\r\n    'z-index': 0,\r\n    '.bar': false,\r\n    '.baz': null, // this one already worked\r\n    '.qux': undefined,\r\n  },\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow works like it did in v3 and omits `.bar`, `.baz`, and `.qux`","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18571","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Don’t output CSS objects with `false` or `undefined` in the AST\" (#18571)"},{"Id":"3249055706","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-21T16:54:52","Actor":"jacobfriedman","Number":"18582","RawContent":null,"Title":"Z-index is inaccurate","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

For context, i am working on a component library using the new vite tailwind plugin.\n\nIf you export tailwind 4 css into a tailwind 3 project (even with prefix) it throws due to: `@layer base is used but no matching @tailwind base directive is present.`. \n\nThe recommended workaround is to rename the layers as detailed [here](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/18123#discussioncomment-13245038).\n\nIn my case this looks like this:\n\n```css\n@layer swt-theme, swt-base, swt-components, swt-utilities;\n@import \"tailwindcss/theme.css\" layer(swt-theme) prefix(swt);\n@import \"tailwindcss/preflight.css\" layer(swt-base) prefix(swt);\n@import \"tailwindcss/utilities.css\" layer(swt-utilities) prefix(swt);\n\n@plugin \"daisyui\" {\n    themes: all;\n}\n```\n\nIn addition to tailwind i use daisyui 5 (compatible with tailwind 4). Because of the daisyui plugin, the final .css file still contains references to `@layer base` resulting in `@layer base is used but no matching @tailwind base directive is present`.\n\nI reported this as [issue](https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui/issues/3937) with a [tailwind play link](https://play.tailwindcss.com/z19vEIqURl?file=css), but it seems that this issue cannot be adressed by the author of daisyui. \n\nI quote:\n> I understand.\n> Unfortunately, it's not possible yet to use another layer name due to Tailwind CSS plugin API.\n> Tailwind CSS provides APIs like addBase, addComponents, addUtilities\n> addBase always adds styles to Tailwind's predefined @layer base and addComponents, addUtilities always add styles to Tailwind's predefined @layer utilities.\n>\n> If Tailwind provides more access regarding this behavior, we may be able to provide an option as well.\n\nI hope that you can provide a way for plugin provider to either customize layer names or to correctly propagate any name changes in the tailwind config to the plugins.\n\nThis issue currently forces me to update the css file by hand before publishing, so it is really annoying 😅 \n\nThanks for your time, reading this!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18558","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enable plugins to rename layer names\" (#18558)"},{"Id":"3234197609","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-16T14:20:14","Actor":"askdevai-bot","Number":"18549","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Add comprehensive LLM-friendly API reference","State":"closed","Body":"## Summary\n\nThis PR adds a comprehensive LLM-friendly API reference document (`LLM.md`) to the TailwindCSS repository.

Certain elements have poor contrast, making text difficult to read and reducing accessibility compliance (e.g., WCAG guidelines). This can negatively affect users with visual impairments and general usability.\n\n### Problem Areas Identified\n- **Low contrast between text and background**, making readability difficult.\n- **Color combinations that do not follow accessibility best practices** (e.g., red on blue or neon colors together).\n- **Inconsistent color usage** across different sections, affecting UI consistency.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n1. Navigate to the affected page/component.\n2. Observe text readability and color contrast.\n3. Use an accessibility contrast checker to validate WCAG compliance.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n- Improved color choices that ensure **better readability and accessibility**.\n- Compliance with **WCAG 2.1 guidelines** (minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text).\n- Consistent color usage for a better UI experience.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n- Update the color palette to **maintain high contrast** for better readability.\n- Ensure colors align with **brand identity** while improving accessibility.\n\n### Labels\n`bug` `accessibility` `UI/UX issue` `enhancement`\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f8c2bc3-4c38-471e-9222-f93d3d48c4db)\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bab8ffe6-7393-401b-8de5-86bc1f89be51)","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16888","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Improve Color Contrast for Better Readability & UX and Avoid Color Clashing\" (#16888)"},{"Id":"2887734266","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-28T17:36:49","Actor":"andriygm","Number":"16880","RawContent":null,"Title":"`.eps` files are included in source file detection","State":"open","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\nv4.0.6\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\n@tailwindcss/cli v4.0.9\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nv23.7.0\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nArc (chromium)\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nmacOS\n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/lffyvk\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nWhen generating output CSS using Tailwind CLI (seems to also happen with the vite plugin), Tailwind includes .eps files and thus adds invalid syntax to the output CSS:\n```css\n.\\[h3_ZF_m9\\:O\\] {\n    h3_ZF_m9: O;\n  }\n  .\\[ro0OH\\:\\>GA9\\*\\&Z\\;oheh-\\!a_V\\)gL\\?\\*\\,oC_FdhIkP\\=\\=SBF\\,B\\\\\\`ff\\$P2amRVs\\] {\n    ro0OH: >GA9*&Z;oheh-!a V)gL?*,oC FdhIkP==SBF,B\\`ff$P2amRVs;\n  }\n  .\\[t0\\:IuYnhV6c\\] {\n    t0: IuYnhV6c;\n  }\n```\n\nI couldn't find a way to manually exclude the file from source file detection apart from adding it to the .gitignore -- maybe it would be worth adding a way to ignore individual misbehaving files?","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16880","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`.eps` files are included in source file detection\" (#16880)"},{"Id":"2887157660","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-28T14:06:44","Actor":"SusanthCom","Number":"16876","RawContent":null,"Title":"unexpected result when adding a custom break point ( --breakpoint-3xl:2048px; )","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

The reason we did that is because Google Chrome is showing a warning in the devtools styles panel that this is invalid. However, this _is_ valid and the code actually works as expected.\n\nIf we look at the CSS spec for this:\n\n> Note: Custom properties can contain a trailing `!important`, but this is automatically removed from the property’s value by the CSS parser, and makes the custom property \"important\" in the CSS cascade. In other words, the prohibition on top-level \"!\" characters does not prevent `!important` from being used, as the `!important` is removed before syntax checking happens.\n>\n> — https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables-1/#syntax\n\n\nSo given this input:\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\nbody {\n  --text-color: var(--color-white) !important;\n  --bg-color: var(--color-blue-950) !important;\n\n  /* Direct usage */\n  background-color: var(--bg-color);\n\n  /* Usage inside other functions as-if the `!important` is in the middle instead of the end */\n  color: color-mix(in oklab, var(--text-color) 75%, transparent);\n}\n```\n\nYou will notice that everything works as expected, but if you look at the Styles panel in Chrome for the `<body>` element, you will see an incorrect warning.

This means that the usage has to change:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- CLASS_TABLE[cursor.curr as usize]\r\n+ Class::TABLE[cursor.curr as usize]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is slightly worse UX, and this is where another change comes in. We implemented the `From<u8> for #enum_name` trait inside of the `ClassifyBytes` derive macro. This allows us to use `.into()` on any `u8` as long as we are comparing it to a `Class` instance. In our scenario:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- Class::TABLE[cursor.curr as usize]\r\n+ cursor.curr.into()\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage wise, this looks something like this:\r\n```diff\r\n        while cursor.pos < len {\r\n-           match Class::TABLE[cursor.curr as usize] {\r\n+           match cursor.curr.into() {\r\n-               Class::Escape => match Class::Table[cursor.next as usize] {\r\n+               Class::Escape => match cursor.next.into() {\r\n                    // An escaped whitespace character is not allowed\r\n                    Class::Whitespace => return MachineState::Idle,\r\n\r\n                    // An escaped character, skip ahead to the next character\r\n                    _ => cursor.advance(),\r\n                },\r\n\r\n                // End of the string\r\n                Class::Quote if cursor.curr == end_char => return self.done(start_pos, cursor),\r\n\r\n                // Any kind of whitespace is not allowed\r\n                Class::Whitespace => return MachineState::Idle,\r\n\r\n                // Everything else is valid\r\n                _ => {}\r\n            };\r\n\r\n            cursor.advance()\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        MachineState::Idle\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you manually look at the `Class::TABLE` in your editor for example, you can see that it is properly generated at compile time.\r\n\r\nGiven this input:\r\n```rs\r\n#[derive(Clone, Copy, ClassifyBytes)]\r\nenum Class {\r\n    #[bytes_range(b'a'..=b'z')]\r\n    AlphaLower,\r\n\r\n    #[bytes_range(b'A'..=b'Z')]\r\n    AlphaUpper,\r\n\r\n    #[bytes(b'@')]\r\n    At,\r\n\r\n    #[bytes(b':')]\r\n    Colon,\r\n\r\n    #[bytes(b'-')]\r\n    Dash,\r\n\r\n    #[bytes(b'.')]\r\n    Dot,\r\n\r\n    #[bytes(b'\\0')]\r\n    End,\r\n\r\n    #[bytes(b'!')]\r\n    Exclamation,\r\n\r\n    #[bytes_range(b'0'..=b'9')]\r\n    Number,\r\n\r\n    #[bytes(b'[')]\r\n    OpenBracket,\r\n\r\n    #[bytes(b']')]\r\n    CloseBracket,\r\n\r\n    #[bytes(b'(')]\r\n    OpenParen,\r\n\r\n    #[bytes(b'%')]\r\n    Percent,\r\n\r\n    #[bytes(b'\"', b'\\'', b'`')]\r\n    Quote,\r\n\r\n    #[bytes(b'/')]\r\n    Slash,\r\n\r\n    #[bytes(b'_')]\r\n    Underscore,\r\n\r\n    #[bytes(b' ', b'\\t', b'\\n', b'\\r', b'\\x0C')]\r\n    Whitespace,\r\n\r\n    #[fallback]\r\n    Other,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the result:\r\n<img width=\"1244\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ffd6ad3-0b2f-4381-a24c-593e4c72080e\" />\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/16864","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Improve internal DX around byte classification [1]\" (#16864)"},{"Id":"2885736035","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-27T22:25:59","Actor":"acalvino4","Number":"16856","RawContent":null,"Title":"Cannot override tailwind utilities.","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

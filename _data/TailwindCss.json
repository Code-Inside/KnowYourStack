For example let's imagine we had this:\n```css\n@tailwind base;\n\nbody {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n\n@tailwind components;\n\n.btn {}\n\n@tailwind utilities;\n```\n\nThis will now be turned into:\n```css\n@import 'tailwindcss';\n\nbody {\n  background-color: red;\n}\n\n.btn {}\n```\n\nBut in v4 we use real layers, in v3 we used to replace the directive with the result of that layer. This means that now the `body` and `.btn` styles are in the incorrect spot.\n\nTo solve this, we have to wrap them in a layer. The `body` should go in an `@layer base`, and the `.btn` should be in an `@layer components` to make sure it's in the same spot as it was before.\n\nThat's what this PR does, the original input will now be turned into:\n\n```css\n@import 'tailwindcss';\n\n@layer base {\n  body {\n    background-color: red;\n  }\n}\n\n@layer components {\n  .btn {\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThere are a few internal refactors going on as well, but those are less important.\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14504","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add CSS codemod for missing `@layer`\" (#14504)"},{"Id":"2543631877","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-24T15:43:57","Actor":"adamwathan","Number":"14500","RawContent":null,"Title":"Only apply hover on devices that support hover","State":"closed","Body":"This PR updates the `hover` variant to only apply when `@media (hover: hover)` matches.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n  .hover\\:bg-black {\r\n    &:hover {\r\n+     @media (hover: hover) {\r\n        background: black;\r\n+     }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is technically a breaking change because you may have built your site in a way where some interactions depend on hover (like opening a dropdown menu), and were relying on the fact that tapping on mobile triggers hover.\r\n\r\nTo bring back the old hover behavior, users can override the `hover` variant in their CSS file back to the simpler implementation:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\r\n@variant hover (&:hover);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've opted to go with just `@media (hover: hover)` for this because it seems like the best trade-off between the available options. Using `(any-hover: hover)` would mean users would get sticky hover states when tapping on an iPad if they have a mouse or trackpad connected, which feels wrong to me because in those cases touch is still likely the primary method of interaction.\r\n\r\nSites built with this feature in mind will be treating hover styles as progressive enhancement, so it seems better to me that using an iPad with a mouse would not have hover styles, vs. having sticky hover styles in the same situation.\r\n\r\nOf course users can always override this with whatever they want, so making this the default isn't locking anyone in to a particular choice.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14500","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Only apply hover on devices that support hover\" (#14500)"},{"Id":"2545618143","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-24T15:25:34","Actor":"samouri","Number":"14505","RawContent":null,"Title":"Tailwind Base CSS Variable Performance","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

I really love using it.\r\n\r\nWhile diagnosing performance problems on a closed-source app I develop, I realized that `@base` is adding a host of css variables to the `*` selector. I'm confused why it's targeted this way instead of [:root](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root#examples).\r\n\r\nI *think* targeting `*` is an issue for css variables in particular because it appears to redefine the variable at every single node. That's why when inspecting any element on the page and looking at the variable definitions, you'll often see dozens of overriden definitions. Not only is this noisy, but I've measured a significant performance impact to `Recalculate Styles` in Chrome Devtools.\r\n\r\n*Performance impact details*\r\n\r\nIt's likely a different level of impact for every app, but I'm measuring around a ~2.5x hit to Recalculate Styles on Tailwind Play. The closed-source app I develop involves a page with a supidly large number of DOM elements and has a larger impact. It likely scales with the depth of nodes. See the attached screenshots for traces I took on Tailwind Play with the css vars applied to `*` vs. `:root`.\r\n\r\n\r\n| * selector  |  :root selector |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| 5.18ms  | 1.96ms |\r\n\r\nRepro steps: do the below steps for both default and after modifying the css var initialization selector to `:root`.\r\n1. Go to https://play.tailwindcss.com/.\r\n2. Click the \"Preview only\" button.\r\n3. Now start a performance trace and click the \"Vertical Split\" option.\r\n4.

For example, `text-[2.4rem]` will have a calculated line height of `2.625rem`, instead of `3.6rem`. \r\n- The default values are calculated in CSS, which means you can use arbitrary values in combination with custom properties (eg `text-[length:var(--title-font-size)]`). \r\n- Relative font sizes like `text-[1.5em]` or `text-[larger]` will now use a recalculated line height.\r\n- Only breaking change is the line height of `lg` (also see #14223).\r\n- The line heights are always rounded to even pixels (2px), so that you never have vertical alignment issues.

It also adds support for \"arbitrary gradients\", where gradient utilities like `bg-linear-*`, `bg-radial-*`, and `bg-conic-*` can now accept a complete gradient definition as their arbitrary value.\r\n\r\n## Radial gradients\r\n\r\nRadial gradients are created with the `bg-radial` utility, or the `bg-radial-[…]` utility, combined with the existing `from-*`, `via-*`, and `to-*` utilities.\r\n\r\nThe simple `bg-radial` utility just creates a radial gradient with no position information, which defaults to `center`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nradial-gradient({from}, {via}, {to});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you use the arbitrary value format, whatever you provide as the arbitrary value is inserted into the first position:\r\n\r\n```\r\nradial-gradient({arbitrary value}, {from}, {via}, {to});\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo a utility like `bg-radial-[at_top_left]` would produce this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nradial-gradient(at top left, {from}, {via}, {to});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes it possible to use some of the `radial-gradient(…)` features that this PR doesn't add first class support for, like using values like `circle at center` or providing a specific interpolation color space like `in hsl longer hue`. We may add explicit APIs for these in the future, but I'm proposing this PR first since those changes would be purely additive and none of the decisions here would create any conflict with those APIs.\r\n\r\n## Conic gradients\r\n\r\nConic gradients are created with the `bg-conic`, `bg-conic-{bareNumber}`, and `bg-conic-[…]` utilities, combined with the existing `from-*`, `via-*`, and `to-*` utilities.\r\n\r\nThe `bg-conic` utility creates a conic gradient with no angle, which defaults to `0deg`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconic-gradient({from}, {via}, {to});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `bg-conic-{bareNumber}` utilities create conic gradients using the bare number as the angle:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconic-gradient(from {bareNumber}deg, {from}, {via}, {to});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `bg-conic-[…]` arbitrary value utilities insert whatever you provide as the arbitrary value into the first position verbatim:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconic-gradient({arbitraryValue}, {from}, {via}, {to});\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo a utility like `bg-conic-[from_45deg_in_hsl]` would produce this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconic-gradient(from 45deg in hsl, {from}, {via}, {to});\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the `from` keyword needs to be provided by the user when using arbitrary values, but not when using bare values.\r\n\r\nThis makes it possible to use some of the `conic-gradient(…)` features that this PR doesn't add first class support for, like using values like `at 0 0` or providing a specific interpolation color space like `in hsl longer hue`.

TYPO3 uses it's own templating engine to generate HTML for the frontend, which is called Fluid.\n\nHere's an example Fluid template snippet:\n\n```html\n<!-- Fluid template language -->\n<f:variable name=\"bgStyle\">\n  <f:switch expression=\"{data.layout}\">\n    <f:case value=\"0\">from-blue-900 to-cyan-200</f:case>\n    <f:case value=\"1\">from-cyan-600 to-teal-200</f:case>\n    <f:defaultCase>from-blue-300 to-cyan-100</f:defaultCase>\n  </f:switch>\n</f:variable>\n\n<!-- Normal HTML code with Fluid variable \"bgStyle\" in the \"class\" attribute -->\n<div class=\"bg-gradient-to-br from-20% {bgStyle}\">...</div>\n```\n\nUp until today this worked just fine. Today I updated my NPM packages (`npm update`). The packages were updated from version 4.0.6 to version 4.0.12. Now CSS classes that are not written inside normal HTML code (last line in the example), are not picked up and therefore are not added to the final CSS file.\n\nThen I've read about the insiders versions and tried to install those. But still the CSS classes inside the Fluid template part are not recognized.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17088","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Classes not generated after upgrading npm packages when CSS classes are inside TYPO3 Fluid template tags\" (#17088)"},{"Id":"2905360498","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-09T11:07:57","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"17087","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ensure candidate extraction works as expected in Clojure/ClojureScript","State":"open","Body":"This PR adds a Clojure/ClojureScript pre processor to make sure that candidate extraction works as expected.\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17087","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Ensure candidate extraction works as expected in Clojure/ClojureScript\" (#17087)"},{"Id":"2905034574","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-09T10:47:59","Actor":"mkfizi","Number":"17078","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] divide-* class produces extra border on hidden last child element","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

There is no runtime check to see what state we are in, instead we transition to the new state when it's necessary.\r\n\r\nThis has some nice performance improvements for some of the state machines, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- ArbitraryVariableMachine: Throughput: 744.92 MB/s\r\n+ ArbitraryVariableMachine: Throughput:   1.21 GB/s\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe also don't have to store the current state because each machine runs to completion. It's during execution that we can move to a new state if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the diff is a tiny bit annoying to read, but essentially this is what happened:\r\n\r\n### The `enum` is split up in it's individual states as structs:\r\n```rs\r\nenum State {\r\n  A,\r\n  B,\r\n  C,\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBecomes:\r\n```rs\r\nstruct A;\r\nstruct B;\r\nstruct C;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Generics\r\n\r\nThe current machine will receive a generic `State` that we can default to the `IdleState`. Then we use `PhantomData` to \"use\" the type because the generic type is otherwise not used as a concrete value, it's just a marker.\r\n\r\n```rs\r\nstruct MyMachine {}\r\n```\r\nBecomes:\r\n```rs\r\nstruct MyMachine<State = Idle> {\r\n  _state: std::marker::PhantomData<State>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Split \r\n\r\nNext, the `next` function used to match on the current state, but now each match arm is moved to a dedicated implementation instead:\r\n```rs\r\nimpl Machine for MyMachine {\r\n  fn next(&mut self) -> MachineState {\r\n    match self.state {\r\n      State::A => { /* … */ },\r\n      State::B => { /* … */ },\r\n      State::C => { /* … */ },\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n``` \r\nBecomes:\r\n```rs\r\nimpl Machine for MyMachine<A> {\r\n  fn next(&mut self) -> MachineState {\r\n    /* … */\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nimpl Machine for MyMachine<B> {\r\n  fn next(&mut self) -> MachineState {\r\n    /* … */\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nimpl Machine for MyMachine<C> {\r\n  fn next(&mut self) -> MachineState {\r\n    /* … */\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's a bit more verbose, but now each state is implemented in its own block. This also removes 2 levels of nesting which is a nice benefit.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17083","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Refactor: use compile time type state pattern\" (#17083)"},{"Id":"2905231019","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-09T06:19:16","Actor":"ledermann","Number":"17081","RawContent":null,"Title":"4.0.12 - Regression with SLIM templates (single quotes)","State":"open","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\nv4.0.12\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\n@tailwindcss/cli\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nv22.12.0\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nBrave 1.76.73\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nmacOS 15\n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\nhttps://github.com/ledermann/tailwind-4.0.12-slim-issue\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nSimilar to #16975 and #16998, there is another issue with SLIM templates.

All of DaisyUI seems to be added to the app/assets/builds/tailwind.css output file.\n\nMy theory is that Tailwind is interpreting the daisyui.js file as a source file of the project because it doesn't fall into any of the rules of files [ignored by Tailwind's scanner](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/detecting-classes-in-source-files#which-files-are-scanned).\n\nThe resulting file weighs 177kb.

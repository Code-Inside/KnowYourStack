I want to throw something somewhere and see something suffer to make myself feel better lol. I am trying, and let me clarify that I have spent HOURS AND HOURS trying to get Tailwind set up for a new build. This is my first time trying tailwind. I have had ChatGPT help me try to set it up. I have watched YouTube videos by people who supposedly know how to set it up. I have started THREE completely fresh builds and followed the Tailwind set up process directly by copy and paste from their website, and NONE of it has worked. I drop my first component into my index.html file and the formatting is off. The ONLY way I have gotten Tailwind to work correctly so far is by including the CDN in the HTML file, which everyone everywhere says is the wrong way to go, but the only way that seems to work. WTF.  What could I be doing wrong? It is so so so so so so so frustrating to following instructions to the letter and have it not work right from the start. Please, for the love of god, someone help.

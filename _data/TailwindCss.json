Please click on `Run` to run the instance and `Show files` to view the code. \r\n\r\nI couldn't replicate it on play.tailwindcss.com because the files are required to be in a specific folder structure to reproduce.\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nI have a PHP project with hundreds of files. Markup of various components (like menus) is generated by a CMS. As adding classes is not an option, I need to use `[&_]` on the containers to style them. Some layouts break when I update from `v3.1.x` to `v3.2.x` because the CSS order of certain selectors in the CSS generated is wrong. \r\n\r\nIt occurs only when:\r\n- `[&_]` classes are used with `v3.2.x`. Everything works flawlessly with `v3.1.x`.\r\n- specific conditions are met. I'm still trying to figure them out. But I was able to create an isolated demo for you.\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\nIn the following markup, the list items should be stacked in SM, and side-by-side from MD onwards. But they stay stacked in all viewports.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"[&_ul]:flex [&_ul]:flex-col md:[&_ul]:flex-row\">\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Item 1</li>\r\n    <li>Item 2</li>\r\n    <li>Item 3</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nGenerated CSS:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@media (min-width: 768px) {\r\n  .md\\:\\[\\&_ul\\]\\:flex-row ul {\r\n    flex-direction: row;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n.\\[\\&_ul\\]\\:flex ul {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.\\[\\&_ul\\]\\:flex-col ul {\r\n  flex-direction: column;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected CSS:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.\\[\\&_ul\\]\\:flex ul {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.\\[\\&_ul\\]\\:flex-col ul {\r\n  flex-direction: column;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media (min-width: 768px) {\r\n  .md\\:\\[\\&_ul\\]\\:flex-row ul {\r\n    flex-direction: row;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Demo**\r\n\r\nI created an online demo https://replit.com/@rahulv3a/Tailwind-bug of the example mentioned above. It contains only the code required to reproduce the bug. Please click on `Run` to run the instance and `Show files` to view the code. \r\n\r\n- Tailwind setup\r\n  - v3.2.4 is being used.\r\n  - `yarn tailwindcss -i ./src/style.css -o ./dist/style.css` is used to generate the CSS.\r\n  - `preflight` is disabled to keep things simple.\r\n\r\n- Conditions\r\n  - tailwind.config.js\r\n    - `content` has `[\"./inc/**/*.php\", \"./templates/**/*.php\"]`.\r\n    - The order of the paths is important to replicate the issue.\r\n  - inc/functions.php\r\n    - It contains two comments. In my project, `./inc` contains hundreds of functions that are documented in detail. The comments contain words like contents, lowercase, etc. Tailwind creates classes for them which is fine. But for some reason unknown, the comments that start with `//` interfere with the order of CSS selectors.\r\n  - template/01-required.php\r\n    - I don't know why but this code is required to replicate the issue.\r\n  - template/component.php\r\n    - This file contains the actual code mentioned in the example above.\r\n\r\n**More examples**\r\nHere are some more examples of the bug I experience in my project with `v3.2.x`:\r\n- `<br>` stays hidden in all viewports.\r\n  ```html\r\n  <h1 class=\"[&amp;_br]:hidden [&amp;_br]:xl:block\">\r\n    Lorem<br />\r\n    Ipsum\r\n  </h1>\r\n  ```\r\n- `<img>` stays full width in all viewports.\r\n  ```html\r\n  <figure class=\"[&_img]:w-full md:[&_img]:w-[300px] xl:[&_img]:w-[340px]\">\r\n    <img src=\"./image.jpg\" alt=\"some image\" />\r\n  </figure>\r\n  ```\r\nI can create isolated demos for each of them if it helps you debug.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need any other information.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/10267","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Order of CSS selectors is not correct with v3.2.x in specific scenarios\" (#10267)"},{"Id":"1527528229","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-10T14:57:12","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"10288","RawContent":null,"Title":"Consider earlier variants before sorting functions","State":"closed","Body":"We were sorting based on functions unconditionally before.

I thought of codesandbox, but it is harder to show the CSS file.\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nPlugin adds utility classes, and there's a config option `useMediaReset` which adds `@media` classes to reset the classes to tailwind's defaults.\r\n\r\nIn the end it looks like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\naddUtilities({\r\n    '.text-vw-xl': {\r\n        'font-size': 'clamp(10px, 1.5625vw, 30px)',\r\n        'line-height': 1.25',\r\n        // if `useMediaReset`\r\n        '@media (min-width: 1920px)': {\r\n            'font-size': '1.25rem'\r\n        },\r\n        '@media (max-width: 639.99px)': {\r\n            'font-size': '1.25rem'\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    '.text-vw-2xl': {\r\n        'font-size': 'clamp(12px, 1.875vw, 36px)',\r\n        'line-height': 1.25',\r\n        // if `useMediaReset`\r\n        '@media (min-width: 1920px)': {\r\n            'font-size': '1.5rem'\r\n        },\r\n        '@media (max-width: 639.99px)': {\r\n            'font-size': '1.5rem'\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    // other classes for `xs`, `sm`, etc.\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem with this is that all of the classes now have their own `@media` in a generated css file, which leads to enormous file size...\r\n\r\nThis is the same after `npm run build`.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.text-vw-xl {\r\n  font-size: clamp(10px, 1.5625vw, 30px);\r\n  line-height: 1.25;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media (max-width: 639.99px) {\r\n  .text-vw-xl {\r\n    font-size: 1.25rem;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media (min-width: 1920px) {\r\n  .text-vw-xl {\r\n    font-size: 1.25rem;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n.text-vw-2xl {\r\n  font-size: clamp(12px, 1.875vw, 36px);\r\n  line-height: 1.25;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media (max-width: 639.99px) {\r\n  .text-vw-2xl {\r\n    font-size: 1.5rem;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media (min-width: 1920px) {\r\n  .text-vw-2xl {\r\n    font-size: 1.5rem;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand that this could be because there should be an order of classes, but I think in the most cases it could be combined into one. For example combining `@media`s into one when they are inside one `addUtilities` function, same thing inside other `addUtilities`.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/10247","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Composing @media into one when using addUtilities in plugin.\" (#10247)"},{"Id":"1520503141","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-05T10:43:55","Actor":"MrDobi","Number":"10245","RawContent":null,"Title":"Escaping _ in template literals (after content directive)","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

Additionally, if the first variant was arbitrary then _all_ classes in all variants would end up un-prefixed. For example:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"[.foo_&]:group-hover:tw-underline\">test</div>\r\n<div class=\"group-hover:[.foo_&]:tw-underline\">test</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese would result in the selectors:\r\n```\r\n.foo .group:hover .\\[\\.foo_\\&\\]\\:group-hover\\:tw-underline\r\n.tw-group:hover .tw-foo .group-hover\\:\\[\\.foo_\\&\\]\\:tw-underline\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice how:\r\n1. The first one doesn't have the `group` class prefixed like it should.\r\n2. The second has the `foo` class prefixed when it should not.\r\n\r\nHere we rework the  functions `finalizeSelector` and `formatVariantSelector` together to take multiple formats. They were previously using a mix for AST and string-based parsing. This now does the full transformation using the selector AST, parses the format strings AST as early as possible, and is set up to parse them only once for a given set of rules. All of this will allow considering metadata on a per format string basis. For instance, we now know if the format string `.foo &` was produced by a normal variant or by an arbitrary variant. We use this information to control the prefixing behavior for individual format strings.\r\n\r\nFixes #10125 ","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/10214","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Don't prefix classes in arbitrary variants\" (#10214)"},{"Id":"1517262508","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-03T11:38:31","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"10229","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow direct nesting in `root` or `@layer` nodes","State":"closed","Body":"This PR fixes a false positive issue where using nested css directly inside `@layer` nodes will show you a console warning, but this should be totally fine:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@layer tw-base, tw-components, tw-utilities;\r\n\r\n@layer tw-base { @tailwind base }\r\n@layer tw-components { @tailwind components }\r\n@layer tw-utilities { @tailwind utilities }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes: #10216\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

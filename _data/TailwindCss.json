I am able to see the className in the html output so it does seem like a bug with the plugin for now to me.\n\nrepro: https://github.com/tylersayshi/waku-vite-tailwind-bug\n\nFrom this code it seems like this should auto-read from the html output, but it does seem to miss this case for now.\n\nhttps://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/main/packages/%40tailwindcss-vite/src/index.ts#L187-L214\n\nI'm happy to help however I can here :)\n\nUpdate: I pushed a working example with postcss here: https://github.com/tylersayshi/waku-vite-tailwind-bug/tree/postcss","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16585","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Can @tailwindcss/vite scan step seems to miss classes in waku\" (#16585)"},{"Id":"2856222961","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-16T17:16:49","Actor":"Damato","Number":"16582","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bug: vite warnings when minifying css - Empty :where() generated","State":"open","Body":"### The code in question:\n\n      body::-webkit-scrollbar {\n            @apply bg-zinc-100 dark:bg-zinc-800;\n      }\n\n### The error on bundling:\n\n      warnings when minifying css:\n      ▲ [WARNING] Unexpected \")\" [css-syntax-error]\n\n      <stdin>:14:30:\n            14 │ body::-webkit-scrollbar:where(){background-color:var(--color-zinc-...\n               ╵                               ^\n\n      ▲ [WARNING] Unexpected \")\" [css-syntax-error]\n\n      <stdin>:16:36:\n            16 │ ...:-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:where(){border-color:var(--color-zinc-...\n               ╵                                   ^\n\n---\n\n### General detail\n\nI am stumped, as I am getting weird behaviours on CSS minification. \n\nIn digging deeper it seems that it generates an empty `where()` when it should generate none. \nIt is only on build, and it is valid CSS that gets altered. Details are added below. \n\nI also found the same recently reported behaviour in the `daisyui` repo. It seems they are struggling with an empty `:is()` being generated. It is a consistent pattern, as I do not use  `daisyui`, but both our projects include Tailwind 4, and same type of issue.\n\nLink for reference.\nhttps://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui/issues/3453\n\nHappy to provide more data as needed, to make lives easier for devs and anyone else with the issue.\n\n---\n\n### What version of TailwindCSS are you using?\n\n      \"tailwindcss\": \"^4.0.4\",\n\n### Project detail\n\n      \"@sveltejs/kit\": \"^2.16.0\",\n      \"@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte\": \"^5.0.0\",\n      \"@tailwindcss/vite\",\n      \"vite\": \"^6.0.0\"\n\n### Command / IDE\n\n      vite build\n      VS Code\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16582","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Bug: vite warnings when minifying css - Empty :where() generated\" (#16582)"},{"Id":"2856047256","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-16T12:04:01","Actor":"tomerzcod7","Number":"16577","RawContent":null,"Title":"Tailwind classes not overriding regular CSS classes","State":"closed","Body":"After upgrading to v4, CSS classes applied to elements imported from external libraries that already has some CSS classes on them stopped working.\n\nI took a closer look and I think this is related to https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide#adding-custom-utilities, Tailwind not \"hijacking\" the the @layer at-rule anymore.\n\nFor example, this is what happens when I try to style ReactFlow package Handle component:\n\nv3:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6926fc0-b913-4739-aee6-5ee07645cf84)\n\nand this is the exact same code with v4:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca87fd3c-4a8f-45d0-93e9-e774900a5df4)\n\nYou can see that in v4, the classes are applied at the utilities cascade layer, making them less specific then the built in unlayered classes (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer#description)\n\nI'm not sure if it's a bug or desired, but it seems to me like this would break a lot of code relying on classes supplied from outside having precedent over internal classes.\n\nThe issues is solved if I mark all classes that are conflicting with important:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47725bf2-9cdf-40f6-8b58-1237b8dfbea8)\n\nIs this the recommended way to solve it?

But since the stable engine doesn't have any idea what `@tailwindcss/oxide` even is, it crashes.\r\n\r\nIf you would inspect the generated code, then it will look something like this:\r\n```js\r\nimport moduleName from '@tailwindcss/oxide'\r\n\r\nif (env.OXIDE) {\r\n  moduleName.doSomethingOxideSpecific()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n... which kind of defeats the whole purpose of the feature flag in the first place. In a project where `OXIDE` is defined this all works fine, but in other places it won't.\r\n\r\nThis PR will switch the **runtime** feature flag, to a **build time** feature flag. This will ensure that the code is not even there in the final built code but that should be fine since you can switch between the engines if you install a different version (`insiders` vs `oxide-insiders`).\r\n\r\nWe will replace `__OXIDE__` at build time. This also means that some parts of the code will now look something like `if (false) { require('@tailwindcss/oxide') }`. This means that the block will never be reachable, but luckily SWCs optimizer will get rid of the dead code entirely.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nüëã Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

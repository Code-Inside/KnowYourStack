The implementation for this is fairly simple: The npm package is downloaded from the official npm servers and extracted into the `node_modules` directory of the `@tailwidncss/oxide` installation.\r\n\r\n## Test plan \r\n\r\nSince we still lack a solid repro of #15806, the way I tested this change was to manually remove all automatically-installed optional dependencies and then running the postinstall script manually. The script then downloads the right version package which makes the import to `@tailwidncss/oxide` work. An appropriate integration test was added too. \r\n\r\nI furthermore also validated that:\r\n\r\n- This works across CI platforms [ci-all]\r\n- The postinstall script bails out when running `pnpm install` in the dev setup. This is necessary since doing the initial install won't have any binary dependencies yet so it would download invalid versions from npm (as the version numbers locally refer to the last released version). We can safely bail out here though since this was never an issue with local development.\r\n- The postinstall script does not do anything when the `@tailwindcss/oxide` library is added _unless_ the issue is detected.\r\n\r\n[ci-all]","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17929","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Download platform specific package if `optionalDependencies` are skipped\" (#17929)"},{"Id":"3051820344","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-09T11:39:17","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"17952","RawContent":null,"Title":"Print sources when `DEBUG=*` is set","State":"closed","Body":"This PR improves the debug logging by also adding the provided `@source` to the log file.

This occurs in what is essentially an empty starter project.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\n1. Create a new Vite project: `pnpm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts`\n2. `cd my-app`\n3. Install Tailwind CSS and related dependencies: `pnpm add -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite`\n4. Initialize Tailwind CSS: `npx tailwindcss init` (this creates `tailwind.config.js`)\n5. Configure `tailwind.config.js`:\n   ```javascript\n   /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\n   export default {\n     content: [\n       \"./index.html\",\n       \"./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}\",\n     ],\n     theme: {\n       extend: {},\n     },\n     plugins: [],\n   }\n\n6. Update vite.config.ts to include the Tailwind CSS plugin:\n```javascript\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite'\nimport react from '@vitejs/plugin-react-swc'\nimport tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite' // Import the plugin\n\n// https://vite.dev/config/\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()], // Add the plugin\n})\n```\n7. Update `src/index.css` to include the Tailwind directive:\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n```\n8. Ensure src/main.tsx imports src/index.css.\n```javascript\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react'\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'\nimport './index.css'\nimport App from './App.tsx'\n\ncreateRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(\n  <StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </StrictMode>,\n)\n```\n9. Run the development server: `pnpm run dev --profile (or vite --profile)`\n[vite-profile-0.cpuprofile](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20116174/vite-profile-0.cpuprofile)\n10. Observe the long startup time.\n\n**Expected behavior** The Vite development server should start within a few seconds for a minimal starter project.\n\n**Actual behavior** The cold start takes 40+ seconds.\n\n**Environment:**\n\nOS: Linux (Debian GNU/Linux 12 bookworm in a dev container)\nNode.js version: v22.15.0\npnpm version: 10.10.0\nVite version: 6.3.5\n@tailwindcss/vite version: 4.1.5\ntailwindcss version: 4.1.5\n@vitejs/plugin-react-swc version: 3.9.0\n\n**Relevant Configuration Files:**\n\n[package.json](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20116184/package.json)\n\n**vite.config.ts:**\n```typescript\nimport tailwindcss from \"@tailwindcss/vite\";\nimport react from \"@vitejs/plugin-react-swc\";\n\nimport { defineConfig } from \"vite\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  server: {\n    host: true,\n  },\n  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],\n});\n```\n**tailwind.config.js**\n```javascript\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\nmodule.exports = {\n  content: [\n    './index.html', // For your root index.html\n    './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n  ],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {},\n  },\n  plugins: [],\n};\n```\n\n**Additional context** The project is running inside a dev container.

This means that as far as core is concerned, there is still only one `utility` layer, however utilities added via these APIs will now create a nested `@layer components`. Since all utilities that are in the `@layer utilities` alone will have have a higher presedenc than the components defined in `@layer utilities.components`, this will emulate the legacy behavior. \r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\n- Added unit tests\r\n- Added a UI test to ensure the layers are resolved correctly ","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17918","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Put components into an extra layer when using the legacy JS API\" (#17918)"},{"Id":"3048206466","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-08T08:24:59","Actor":"eloraa","Number":"17922","RawContent":null,"Title":"Tailwind generates empty classes for certain classnames","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

For instance, <body> should switch from bg-white to bg-black, and a div with bg-blue-300 dark:bg-blue-700 should switch to bg-blue-700.\nActual Behavior:\nThe elements do not change their appearance. They remain styled as per their non-prefixed utility classes (light mode styles). The dark: variants are ignored. Developer tools confirm the dark class is correctly toggled on the <html> element. The only console message is the standard advisory about not using the CDN in production.\nThis issue is reproducible with the minimal HTML provided in the \"Reproduction URL\" section (either via the CodePen link or the direct HTML code).\nThank you for looking into this.\nSaadah Al Kassab\nsaada1964@gmail.com\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17907","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Subject: Play CDN (v3.4.16): `darkMode: 'class'` strategy not applying styles despite correct setup\" (#17907)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-05-10T03:30:23.8511279Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":425}

It can also be composed with `rotate-x-*` and `rotate-y-*` because it's a separate property, but generally I think it will make more sense to use `rotate-z-*` explicitly when trying to compose a 3D rotation, as the order of operations feels more intuitive to me at least.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/13319","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[v4] Make 3D rotations composable\" (#13319)"},{"Id":"2202830824","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-22T16:45:19","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"13322","RawContent":null,"Title":"Transpile `import.meta.url` in config files","State":"closed","Body":"Right now if you try to use `import.meta.url` in a `tailwind.config.js` file (or a dependency) Node will throw an error.

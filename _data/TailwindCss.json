To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create a discussion to first discuss any significant new features.\r\n\r\nFor more info, check out the contributing guide:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Issue:\r\nTailwind CSS only supported font sizes up to text-9xl (8rem). For developers needing larger text sizes (e.g., in hero sections or landing pages), this required:\r\n\r\nUsing arbitrary values like text-[10rem], or Extending the Tailwind theme manually.\r\n\r\n### Change Introduced:\r\nI extended the default fontSize scale by adding new named utilities:\r\ntext-10xl through text-20xl, with increasing rem values (10rem to 20rem).\r\n\r\n- This allows users to scale typography in a consistent and semantic way without relying on custom values.\r\n- Removes the need to use arbitrary utilities or manually extend the theme.\r\n- Keeps the utility-first philosophy intact.\r\n- Makes Tailwind more robust and production-ready for large text use cases such as:\r\n\r\n-           Hero headlines\r\n-           Promo banners\r\n-           Display typography in dashboards\r\n\r\nNow developers can simply write text-12xl or text-16xl directly in their markup, without touching tailwind.config.js.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\n### üß™ How I Tested the Changes\r\nMade the Changes in defaultTheme.js\r\nI added the following entries:\r\n\r\njs\r\n\r\n      '10xl': '10rem',\r\n      '11xl': '11rem',\r\n      '12xl': '12rem',\r\n      '13xl': '13rem',\r\n      '14xl': '14rem',\r\n      '15xl': '15rem',\r\n      '16xl': '16rem',\r\n      '17xl': '17rem',\r\n      '18xl': '18rem',\r\n      '19xl': '19rem',\r\n      '20xl': '20rem',\r\nBuilt the Package\r\nInside the root of the Tailwind repo:\r\n\r\nbash\r\n\r\n      pnpm build\r\n\r\nLinked Locally for Testing\r\n\r\nI linked the local build to a test React project using:\r\n\r\n\r\n      pnpm link --global\r\n# Then inside the test project:\r\n      pnpm link tailwindcss\r\nTested in a React App\r\nIn the test app, I added:\r\n\r\n\r\n      <h1 class=\"text-14xl font-bold text-blue-600\">Massive Text</h1>\r\n‚úÖ Verified that the class was generated correctly in the compiled CSS and rendered properly in the browser.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18351","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Added text-10xl to text-20xl Font Size Utilities\" (#18351)"},{"Id":"3161625571","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-20T00:56:20","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"18352","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update @vitejs/plugin-react 4.5.0 ‚Üí 4.5.2 (patch)","State":"open","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

This PR fixes this case, implements more comprehensive candidate filtering, and supersedes a previous PR.\r\n\r\nHaving recently submitted a PR for handling another special case with Clojure keywords (the presence of `:` inside of keywords), I thought it best to invert the previous strategy: Instead of handling special cases one by one, consume keywords according to the Clojure reader spec. Consume nothing else, other than strings.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, this PR is a tad more invasive rather than additive, for which I apologize. The strategy is this:\r\n- Strings begin with a `\"` and ends with an unescaped `\"`. Consume everything between these delimiters (existing case).\r\n- Keywords begin with `:`, and end with whitespace, or one out of a small set of specific reserved characters. Everything else is a valid character in a keyword. Consume everything between these delimiters, and apply the class splitting previously contained in the outer loop. My previous special case handling of `:` inside of keywords in #18338 is now redundant (and is removed), as this is a more general solution.\r\n- Discard _everything else_. \r\n\r\nI'm hoping that a strategy that is based on Clojure's definition of strings and keywords will pre-empt any further issues with edge cases.\r\n\r\nCloses #18344.\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n- Added failing tests.\r\n- `cargo test` -> failure\r\n- Added fix\r\n- `cargo test` -> success","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18345","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix trailing `)` from interfering with extraction in Clojure keywords\" (#18345)"},{"Id":"3159247200","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-19T07:14:42","Actor":"eneroth","Number":"18344","RawContent":null,"Title":"Trailing `)` interferes with candidate extraction from Clojure/Script keywords","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

The percentage values are missing the % symbol, causing browsers to ignore the rules entirely.\n\n  **Expected Behavior**\n\n  When using opacity modifiers like bg-white/70, Tailwind should generate:\n```css\n  .bg-white\\/70 {\n    background-color: color-mix(in srgb, #fff 70%, transparent);\n  }\n```\n\n  **Actual Behavior**\n\n  Tailwind generates invalid syntax:\n```css\n  .bg-white\\/70 {\n    background-color: color-mix(in srgb, #fff .7, transparent);\n  }\n```\n  Note: .7 instead of 70% - this is invalid and browsers ignore it.\n\n# Reproduction\n\n  **Step 1: Install Tailwind v4.1.18**\n  > npm install tailwindcss@4.1.18 @tailwindcss/vite@4.1.18\n\n  **Step 2: Configure vite.config.js**\n```js\n  import { defineConfig } from 'vite';\n  import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite';\n\n  export default defineConfig({\n    plugins: [tailwindcss()],\n  });\n```\n\n  **Step 3: Use opacity utilities in HTML**\n```html\n  <div class=\"bg-white/70 text-gray-900/80 border-blue-500/50\">\n    Opacity not working\n  </div>\n```\n\n  **Step 4: Check compiled CSS**\n```css\n  /* Generated (INVALID) */\n  .bg-white\\/70 {\n    background-color: color-mix(in srgb, #fff .7, transparent);\n  }\n\n  .text-gray-900\\/80 {\n    color: color-mix(in srgb, oklch(21% .034 264.665) .8, transparent);\n  }\n\n  .border-blue-500\\/50 {\n    border-color: color-mix(in srgb, oklch(62.3% .214 259.815) .5, transparent);\n  }\n```\n\n  **Impact**\n\n  - All opacity modifiers (/10, /20, /50, /80, etc.) fail silently in browsers\n  - Chrome DevTools shows rules as crossed out (invalid)\n  - Affects background colors, text colors, borders, shadows, and any property using opacity\n\n  **Affected Utilities**\n\n  - `bg-{color}/{opacity}` - e.g., `bg-red-500/50`\n  - `text-{color}/{opacity}` - e.g., `text-blue-600/70`\n  - `border-{color}/{opacity}` - e.g., `border-gray-300/30`\n  - Custom classes using @apply with opacity utilities\n\n  Workaround\n\n  Manually override with valid syntax:\n\n```css\n  .bg-white\\/70 {\n    background-color: rgb(255 255 255 / 0.7) !important;\n  }\n```\n\n  Or use the modern RGB syntax directly:\n```css\n  .custom-class {\n    background-color: rgb(255 255 255 / 0.7);\n  }\n```\n\n\n  This appears to be a regression from v3.x, where opacity modifiers worked correctly.\n\n\n  The color-mix() generator should output:\n  - 70% instead of .7\n  - 80% instead of .8\n  - 50% instead of .5","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/19514","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Invalid color-mix() Syntax with Opacity Values\" (#19514)"},{"Id":"3777698740","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2026-01-03T11:51:00","Actor":"Kat404","Number":"19510","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4-alpha] @tailwindcss/vite throws \"Cannot convert undefined or null to object\" loop when using Bun","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\nv4.0.0\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nVite 7.3.0\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nNode.js 25.2.1, using [Bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun) 1.3.5 (baseline version) for the whole proyect\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nFirefox 146.0.1\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nArch Linux x86_64\n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\nhttps://github.com/Kat404/CSS-Aprendizaje\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nHello!

The compiler already knows about all `@utility` definitions when it processes the HTML.\n>\n> In contrast, the CLI/Vite plugin uses the oxide scanner to extract candidates from source files *before* knowing what utilities exist. The `UtilityMachine` in `@tailwindcss/oxide` interprets `/` as a modifier separator (for opacity modifiers like `bg-red-500/20`). When it encounters a second `/` in a utility name, it treats this as \"modifier followed by modifier\" which is invalid, and rejects the entire candidate.\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/19505","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Content Scanner ignores classes with 2 slashes (e.g. ui/button/sm)\" (#19505)"},{"Id":"3769742986","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-30T10:27:43","Actor":"karlhorky","Number":"19501","RawContent":null,"Title":"Arbitrary Responsive Design Breakpoints failing?","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

Create a new project: `bun init`\n2. Add to package.json:\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"bun-plugin-tailwind\": \"^0.1.2\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"bun --hot src/index.ts\"\n  }\n}\n```\n3. Run `bun install && bun run dev`\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\n`bun-plugin-tailwind` declares `bun` as a peer dependency in its package.json:\n\n```json\n\"peerDependencies\": {\n  \"bun\": \">=1.0.0\"\n}\n```\n\nThis causes Bun to install the `bun` npm package, which creates `node_modules/.bin/bun` and `node_modules/.bin/bunx` symlinks. However, these binaries are 0-byte placeholder files that fail to execute.\n\nWhen running `bun run <script>`, Bun prepends `node_modules/.bin` to PATH, so it finds the broken npm-installed `bun` binary instead of the global Bun installation. This causes all scripts to silently fail with exit code 1.\n\n**Expected behavior:** Scripts defined in package.json should work with `bun run dev`.\n\n**Workaround:** Add override to package.json to prevent the `bun` npm package from being installed:\n\n```json\n\"overrides\": {\n  \"bun\": \"link:.\"\n}\n```\n\n**Suggested fix:** Remove `bun` from peerDependencies. Since this plugin only works within the Bun runtime, requiring `bun` as a peer dependency is unnecessary — Bun is always present when using this package.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/19471","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bun-plugin-tailwind: peerDependency on \"bun\" causes broken npm bun package to shadow global Bun installation, breaking all scripts\" (#19471)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2026-01-05T03:30:25.3404697Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":478}

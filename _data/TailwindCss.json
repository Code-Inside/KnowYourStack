The `bg-neutral-900` class does not have any effect (when served either via the Vite hot-reloading dev server or when compiled and viewed via the Vite static production preview server).\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53527c46-6eeb-486d-9a24-45612204bdf5)\n\n### Expected\n\nI expect that the `bg-neutral-900` class in the Pug Vue template would cause Tailwind to include CSS that gives that text a dark background, which is what happens if we go back to `tailwindcss` and `@tailwindcss/vite` at v4.0.9 :\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fc0a7c0-57b7-4f24-96b8-a00fce23a2d5)\n\n**Additional context:**\n\nI recently reported a similar bug for this environment (Vue templates using Pug) here: #17211. That was fixed by #17252, which was included in the Tailwind 4.0.15 release today. Although that issue was fixed, this different issue (where the presence of an HTML attribute seems to cause not all Tailwind classes to be extracted from the Pug Vue template) is present in 4.0.15.\n\nThank you for Tailwind and for taking a look at this bug!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17313","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Some Tailwind classes are not

The implementation was also wrong as it always set alpha to the specific percent instead of applying it additively (note that this can be fixed with `calc(alpha * opacity)` though).\r\n\r\nInstead we decided to fix this by adding a `@supports` query to Preflight that only targets browsers that aren't affected by the crash. We currently use the following workaround:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/*\r\n  Set the default placeholder color to a semi-transparent version of the current text color in browsers that do not\r\n  crash when using `color-mix(…)` with `currentColor`. (https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17194)\r\n*/\r\n\r\n@supports (not (-webkit-appearance: -apple-pay-button)) /* Not Safari */ or\r\n  (contain-intrinsic-size: 1px) /* Safari 17+ */ {\r\n  ::placeholder {\r\n    color: color-mix(in oklab, currentColor 50%, transparent);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\nWhen testing the `color-mix(currentColor)` vs `oklab(from currentColor …)` we created the following support matrix. I'm extending it with _our fix_ which is the fix ended up using:\r\n\r\n| Browser | Version | `color-mix(… currentColor …)` | `oklab(from currentColor …)` | `@supports { color-mix(…) }` |\r\n| ------- | ------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------- |\r\n| Chrome  | 111     | ❌                            | ❌                           | ❌      |\r\n| Chrome  | 116     | ✅                            | ❌                           | ✅      |\r\n| Chrome  | 131+    | ✅                            | ✅                           | ✅      |\r\n| Safari  | 16.4    | 💥                            | ❌                           | ❌       |\r\n| Safari  | 16.6+   | ✅                            | ❌                           | ❌        |\r\n| Safari  | 18+     | ✅                            | ✅                           | ✅      |\r\n| Firefox | 128     | ✅                            | ❌                           | ✅      |\r\n| Firefox | 133     | ✅                            | ✅                           | ✅      |\r\n\r\nNote that on Safari 16, this change makes it so that the browser does not crash yet it still won't work either. That's because now the browser will fall back to the default placeholder color instead.

Essentially if you had a declaration where you used a `--modifier(…)` _and_ a `--value(…)` and both caused the declaration to be removed, the declaration after the current one would be removed as well.\n\nThis happened because 2 reasons:\n\n1. Once we removed the declaration when we handled `--modifier(…)`, we didn't stop the walk and kept going.\n2. The `replaceWith(…)` code allows you to call the function multiple times but immediately mutates the AST. This means that if you call it multiple times that you are potentially removing / updating nodes followed by the current one.\n\nE.g.:\n\n```css\n@utility mask-r-* {\n  --mask-right: linear-gradient(to left, transparent, black --value(percentage));\n  --mask-right: linear-gradient(\n    to left,\n    transparent calc(var(--spacing) * --modifier(integer)),\n    black calc(var(--spacing) * --value(integer))\n  );\n  mask-image: var(--mask-linear), var(--mask-radial), var(--mask-conic);\n}\n```\n\nIf this is used as `mask-r-10%`, then the first definition of `--mask-right` is kept, but the second definition of `--mask-right` is deleted because both `--modifier(integer)` and `--value(integer)` do not result in a valid value.\n\nHowever, the `mask-image` declaration was also removed because the `replaceWith(…)` function was called twice. Once for `--modifier(integer)` and once for `--value(integer)`.\n\n# Test plan\n\n1. Added a test to cover this case.\n2. Existing tests pass.\n3.

This is due to a longstanding issue in Rust that affects all native modules: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/91979. I reported this years ago but unfortunately it is still not fixed, and seems to have gotten worse in Rust 1.83.0 and later. Looks like Tailwind recently updated Rust versions and this issue started appearing when run in tools like Parcel that use worker threads.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to prevent the native module from ever being unloaded. One way to do that is to always load the native module in the main thread in addition to workers, but this is hard to enforce. @Brooooooklyn found another method, which is to use a linker option for this. I tested this on an Ubuntu system and verified it fixed the issue. You can test with the following script.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// test.js\r\nconst {Worker} = require('worker_threads');\r\nnew Worker('./worker.js');\r\n\r\n// worker.js\r\nrequire('@tailwindcss/oxide');\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout this change, a segmentation fault will occur.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17276","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix segmentation fault when loading @tailwindcss/oxide in a Worker thread\" (#17276)"},{"Id":"2927825440","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-18T09:54:45","Actor":"cuiqg","Number":"17264","RawContent":null,"Title":"Are these lines of code incorrect?","State":"closed","Body":"**Reproduction URL**\nhttps://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/d7c81164da55a09ef4333abb5195da2fe2e1ba62/packages/tailwindcss/preflight.css#L33-L42\n\nAre these lines of code incorrect?\n\nIt should be?\n\n```css\nfont-family: var(--default-font-family),\n    ui-sans-serif,\n    system-ui,\n    sans-serif,\n    'Apple Color Emoji',\n    'Segoe UI Emoji',\n    'Segoe UI Symbol',\n    'Noto Color Emoji';\n```\n\n\n\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17264","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Are these lines of code incorrect?\" (#17264)"},{"Id":"2926070698","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-17T19:05:57","Actor":"ygdani89","Number":"17256","RawContent":null,"Title":"Error: ‘Failed to load tailwindcss as a PostCSS plugin’ in Next.js","State":"closed","Body":"Error evaluating Node.js code\nError: It looks like you're trying to use tailwindcss directly as a PostCSS plugin.

The `paint-order` property is used to control the order in which an SVG element's stroke, fill, and markers are painted. By providing a utility for this property, Tailwind CSS users can easily control the painting order of their SVG elements directly within their markup, offering greater flexibility and efficiency.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nThe `paint-order` property is essential when working with SVG elements, as it allows designers and developers to control the order in which the various parts of an SVG element are rendered. This can be especially useful when creating complex illustrations, icons, or charts, where the painting order of strokes, fills, and markers can have a significant impact on the visual appearance.\r\n\r\nThe property accepts three keywords: `fill`, `stroke`, and `markers`. The default order is `fill`, `stroke`, `markers`, but by specifying a different order, users can achieve different visual effects. For example, reversing the order to `markers`, `stroke`, `fill` will cause the fill to be painted on top of the stroke and markers.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nThe below example can also be seen live in Tailwind Play here: https://play.tailwindcss.com/JcWQ4jlPKh\r\n\r\nWith the new `paint-order` utility, users can easily change the painting order of their SVG elements:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\">\r\n  <text x=\"10\" y=\"75\">stroke in front</text>\r\n  <text x=\"10\" y=\"150\" class=\"paint-order-stroke-fill\">stroke behind</text>\r\n</svg>\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"399\" alt=\"example of paint-order CSS property\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5913254/229029723-6fde4e2e-8b1c-4cff-8b43-fdb8c007c32c.png\">\r\n\r\n[_This example is originally sourced from MDN_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/paint-order#examples)\r\n\r\n## Resources & support\r\n\r\n[`paint-order` documentation (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/paint-order)\r\n\r\n<details><summary>supporting tweets (each linked to source tweet) ‚Äî (expand / collapse)</summary><br />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hamiltonulmer/status/1641498438083944449\"><img width=\"595\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5913254/229030483-be3fead7-ff8a-4f24-a367-200a5d91d7d6.png\"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hamiltonulmer/status/1641575986654502912\"><img width=\"595\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5913254/229030498-deb82d00-aee4-450a-9d85-2052724b317b.png\"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/stefanjudis/status/1179038205686865925\"><img width=\"595\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5913254/229030507-f2c3229f-efc9-46eb-b4aa-ddd12d0ef08e.png\"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/stefanjudis/status/1449839589095579650\"><img width=\"596\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5913254/229030520-0f8515d0-37b6-4aed-bfcf-fad946c95ce9.png\"></a>\r\n\r\n</details>","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/10923","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add support for paint-order CSS property\" (#10923)"},{"Id":"1650849843","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-02T13:59:49","Actor":"SylvainGarrigues","Number":"10931","RawContent":null,"Title":"Outdated installation documentation (SvelteKit)","State":"closed","Body":"As per the following domumentation on [Install Tailwind CSS with SvelteKit](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/sveltekit), one should run:\r\n```npx tailwindcss init tailwind.config.cjs -p```\r\n\r\nThis creates an ESM Tailwind config file but the `.cjs`extension is for CommonJS module format.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/10931","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Outdated installation documentation (SvelteKit)\" (#10931)"},{"Id":"1650281994","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-01T14:18:03","Actor":"AeroWang","Number":"10929","RawContent":null,"Title":"Does not match any directories of the form [dirName], Missing tips","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

This is done because the line-clamp plugin is now part of Tailwind CSS itself, and so the plugin is no longer required.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately some build tools hoist conditional `require` calls as static imports, even if they are inside of a `try/catch` block, causing build failures when the `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` package is not installed.\r\n\r\nTo solve this we removed this warning from Tailwind CSS and are instead including it in the latest patch version of the `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` plugin (https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-line-clamp/pull/26).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this means that, unless the user updates to the latest version of the `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` plugin, we can no longer automatically disable the line-clamp plugin ‚Äî which could result in having duplicated CSS entries for the line-clamp utilities.

I was changing the config to typescript and was noticing that the types for the `boxShadow` property seem to miss the option for arrays, even though it works, gets transpiled and works in the css custom property. For `dropShadow`, there are no type errors.\r\n\r\nI peeked into the types and noticed a difference:\r\n\r\n`boxShadow` property: `boxShadow?: ResolvableTo<KeyValuePair<string, string>> | undefined`\r\n`dropShadow` property: `dropShadow?: ResolvableTo<KeyValuePair<string, string | string[]>> | undefined`\r\n\r\nHere is the config in the tailwind play:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  theme: {\r\n    extend: {\r\n      boxShadow: {\r\n        100: [\r\n          '0px 1px 5px 0px rgba(1, 3, 35, 0.03)',\r\n          '0px 5px 18px 0px rgba(1, 3, 35, 0.04)',\r\n          '0px 22px 80px 0px rgba(1, 3, 35, 0.07)',\r\n        ],\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  plugins: [],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich throws `Type 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'string'.`\r\n\r\nI am wondering if this is intentional, but since the syntax does work and is also allowed by the types in `dropShadow`, I think this is an issue.\r\n\r\nI can create a PR to fix this, if this is not intentional.\r\n\r\n**Alternatives I considered**\r\n\r\nWhat I've seen also does work is to just chain the multiple shadows within one string, seperated with a comma.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/10910","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Config: `boxShadow` property: TypeScript error `Type 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'string'.`\" (#10910)"},{"Id":"1647362227","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-30T11:22:30","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"10911","RawContent":null,"Title":"Improve `boxShadow` TypeScript types","State":"closed","Body":"This PR improves the `boxShadow` types and makes it consistent with the `dropShadow` type.\n\nThis will also allow you to type the `boxShadow` as a string or as an array of strings.\n\nImplementation wise this already worked, it's just that the types were out of sync.\n\nFixes: #10910\n\n<!--\n\nüëã Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

There were no error messages.\r\n\r\nHere is my js config file (which works correctly):\r\n\r\ntailwind.config.js:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  content: [\"./src/**/*.{html,ts,tsx}\"],\r\n  darkMode: 'class',\r\n  theme: {\r\n    fontSize: {\r\n      '2xs': ['0.75rem', { lineHeight: '1.25rem' }],\r\n      xs: ['0.8125rem', { lineHeight: '1.5rem' }],\r\n      sm: ['0.875rem', { lineHeight: '1.5rem' }],\r\n      base: ['1rem', { lineHeight: '1.75rem' }],\r\n      lg: ['1.125rem', { lineHeight: '1.75rem' }],\r\n      xl: ['1.25rem', { lineHeight: '1.75rem' }],\r\n      '2xl': ['1.5rem', { lineHeight: '2rem' }],\r\n      '3xl': ['1.875rem', { lineHeight: '2.25rem' }],\r\n      '4xl': ['2.25rem', { lineHeight: '2.5rem' }],\r\n      '5xl': ['3rem', { lineHeight: '1' }],\r\n      '6xl': ['3.75rem', { lineHeight: '1' }],\r\n      '7xl': ['4.5rem', { lineHeight: '1' }],\r\n      '8xl': ['6rem', { lineHeight: '1' }],\r\n      '9xl': ['8rem', { lineHeight: '1' }],\r\n    },\r\n    typography: require('./typography'),\r\n    extend: {\r\n      boxShadow: {\r\n        glow: '0 0 4px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1)',\r\n      },\r\n      maxWidth: {\r\n        lg: '33rem',\r\n        '2xl': '40rem',\r\n        '3xl': '50rem',\r\n        '5xl': '66rem',\r\n      },\r\n      opacity: {\r\n        1: '0.01',\r\n        2.5: '0.025',\r\n        7.5: '0.075',\r\n        15: '0.15',\r\n      },\r\n      colors: require('./colors')\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  plugins: [\r\n    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),\r\n    require('@tailwindcss/forms'),\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here is my tailwind.config.ts which, when used, only emitts the reset css, and no error messages:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport type { Config } from 'tailwindcss'\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  content: [\"./src/**/*.{html,ts,tsx}\"],\r\n  darkMode: 'class',\r\n  theme: {\r\n    fontSize: {\r\n      '2xs': ['0.75rem', { lineHeight: '1.25rem' }],\r\n      xs: ['0.8125rem', { lineHeight: '1.5rem' }],\r\n      sm: ['0.875rem', { lineHeight: '1.5rem' }],\r\n      base: ['1rem', { lineHeight: '1.75rem' }],\r\n      lg: ['1.125rem', { lineHeight: '1.75rem' }],\r\n      xl: ['1.25rem', { lineHeight: '1.75rem' }],\r\n      '2xl': ['1.5rem', { lineHeight: '2rem' }],\r\n      '3xl': ['1.875rem', { lineHeight: '2.25rem' }],\r\n      '4xl': ['2.25rem', { lineHeight: '2.5rem' }],\r\n      '5xl': ['3rem', { lineHeight: '1' }],\r\n      '6xl': ['3.75rem', { lineHeight: '1' }],\r\n      '7xl': ['4.5rem', { lineHeight: '1' }],\r\n      '8xl': ['6rem', { lineHeight: '1' }],\r\n      '9xl': ['8rem', { lineHeight: '1' }],\r\n    },\r\n    typography: require('./typography'),\r\n    extend: {\r\n      boxShadow: {\r\n        glow: '0 0 4px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1)',\r\n      },\r\n      maxWidth: {\r\n        lg: '33rem',\r\n        '2xl': '40rem',\r\n        '3xl': '50rem',\r\n        '5xl': '66rem',\r\n      },\r\n      opacity: {\r\n        1: '0.01',\r\n        2.5: '0.025',\r\n        7.5: '0.075',\r\n        15: '0.15',\r\n      },\r\n      colors: require('./colors')\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  plugins: [\r\n    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),\r\n    require('@tailwindcss/forms')\r\n  ],\r\n} satisfies Config\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know if more info is needed.\r\n\r\nKind regards, Emil","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/10891","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"tailwind.config.ts (TypeScript) not working\" (#10891)"},{"Id":"1645521557","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-29T13:32:38","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"10898","RawContent":null,"Title":"Try resolving `config.default` before `config` to ensure the config file is resolved correctly","State":"closed","Body":"This PR fixes an issue where resolving the config object returns an object including `default` in some scenario's.\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to resolve `config.default` before `config` to ensure we always have the object we need.\r\n\r\nFixes: #10891\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nüëã Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

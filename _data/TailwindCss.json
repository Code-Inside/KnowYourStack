If this is used with `value(…)`, it's a signal to Tailwind to treat the value + modifier as a single value:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/* The CSS `ratio` type is our signal to treat the value + modifier as a fraction */\r\n@utility aspect-* {\r\n  /* aspect-square, aspect-3/4, aspect-[7/9] */\r\n  aspect-ratio: value(--aspect-ratio-*, ratio, [ratio]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/15455","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add functional utility syntax\" (#15455)"},{"Id":"2750673118","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-19T15:38:08","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"15453","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update @vitejs/plugin-react 4.3.1 → 4.3.4 (patch)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

When comparing the same HTML with the same utility classes against a Rails project building with Vite (minimal repo [here](https://github.com/phillipspc/railstailwindvite)), that styling looks correct there, but wrong in the gem version.\r\n\r\nHere's a screenshot of a copy/pasted [TailwindUI component](https://tailwindui.com/components/application-ui/forms/input-groups#component-2607d970262ada86428f063c72b1e7bd):\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4410fc8c-1dc5-4eda-b7f0-c396f4ae9d61)\r\n\r\nI opened this [issue originally on the gem's GitHub page](https://github.com/rails/tailwindcss-rails/issues/443), however according to the maintainer:\r\n> There's no magic in this gem, it's just running the upstream tailwindcss CLI against the generated tailwind config.\r\n\r\nSo it seems like whatever is breaking things in the gem is happening \"upstream\". This issue was [first reported](https://github.com/rails/tailwindcss-rails/discussions/441#discussion-7616317) on December 5th. \r\nI'm wondering if anyone from the Tailwind team would have a better idea, given that timing, of what might have changed that would introduce a downstream issue with the `tailwindcss-rails` gem. \r\n\r\nAny help is much appreciated, and if I can assist in providing any better reproduction/troubleshooting steps, I'm happy to do so!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/15426","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Style output via `tailwindcss-rails` gem appears off when compared to other build options\" (#15426)"},{"Id":"2749660695","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-19T10:44:20","Actor":"dany68","Number":"15443","RawContent":null,"Title":"Components are not working with utilities classes","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\nTailwind v4.0.0-beta.8\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\nVite v5.4.11, in an electron-vite app\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\nv22.11.0\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\n\r\nChrome (electronjs version 31.7.6  app)\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\n\r\nMacOS\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nIt seems components cannot have utilities such as md:, lg: or dark: applied to it.

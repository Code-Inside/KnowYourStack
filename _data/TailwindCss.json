In Tailwind V4 on my windows laptop after the latest update when my laptop is folded over in tablet mode while using a mouse the on hover effect does not work on buttons. Normally I would chalk this up to a weird Windows configuration especially being that I just did an update but most other buttons on the Internet seem to work fine, even the ones from the old [tailwind docs.](https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-statesl) work fine . This issue happens in both the recreation repo I made for you and on the official docs of the current version [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#hover-focus-and-active]https://tailwindcss.com/docs/hover-focus-and-other-states#hover-focus-and-active).

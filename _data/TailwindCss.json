The `paint-order` property is used to control the order in which an SVG element's stroke, fill, and markers are painted. By providing a utility for this property, Tailwind CSS users can easily control the painting order of their SVG elements directly within their markup, offering greater flexibility and efficiency.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nThe `paint-order` property is essential when working with SVG elements, as it allows designers and developers to control the order in which the various parts of an SVG element are rendered. This can be especially useful when creating complex illustrations, icons, or charts, where the painting order of strokes, fills, and markers can have a significant impact on the visual appearance.\r\n\r\nThe property accepts three keywords: `fill`, `stroke`, and `markers`. The default order is `fill`, `stroke`, `markers`, but by specifying a different order, users can achieve different visual effects. For example, reversing the order to `markers`, `stroke`, `fill` will cause the fill to be painted on top of the stroke and markers.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nThe below example can also be seen live in Tailwind Play here: https://play.tailwindcss.com/JcWQ4jlPKh\r\n\r\nWith the new `paint-order` utility, users can easily change the painting order of their SVG elements:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\">\r\n  <text x=\"10\" y=\"75\">stroke in front</text>\r\n  <text x=\"10\" y=\"150\" class=\"paint-order-stroke-fill\">stroke behind</text>\r\n</svg>\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"399\" alt=\"example of paint-order CSS property\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5913254/229029723-6fde4e2e-8b1c-4cff-8b43-fdb8c007c32c.png\">\r\n\r\n[_This example is originally sourced from MDN_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/paint-order#examples)\r\n\r\n## Resources & support\r\n\r\n[`paint-order` documentation (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/paint-order)\r\n\r\n<details><summary>supporting tweets (each linked to source tweet) — (expand / collapse)</summary><br />\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hamiltonulmer/status/1641498438083944449\"><img width=\"595\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5913254/229030483-be3fead7-ff8a-4f24-a367-200a5d91d7d6.png\"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hamiltonulmer/status/1641575986654502912\"><img width=\"595\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5913254/229030498-deb82d00-aee4-450a-9d85-2052724b317b.png\"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/stefanjudis/status/1179038205686865925\"><img width=\"595\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5913254/229030507-f2c3229f-efc9-46eb-b4aa-ddd12d0ef08e.png\"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/stefanjudis/status/1449839589095579650\"><img width=\"596\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5913254/229030520-0f8515d0-37b6-4aed-bfcf-fad946c95ce9.png\"></a>\r\n\r\n</details>","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/10923","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add support for paint-order CSS property\" (#10923)"},{"Id":"1645142358","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-30T19:56:59","Actor":"mayerraphael","Number":"10894","RawContent":null,"Title":"@tailwindcss/line-clamp check produces an error if bundled.","State":"closed","Body":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blame/3809127a2ce7e8173611ae40c7a260bb56e6342f/src/util/normalizeConfig.js#L304\r\n\r\nWe use tailwind with StencilJS, which uses Rollup to generate packages.

This is done because the line-clamp plugin is now part of Tailwind CSS itself, and so the plugin is no longer required.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately some build tools hoist conditional `require` calls as static imports, even if they are inside of a `try/catch` block, causing build failures when the `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` package is not installed.\r\n\r\nTo solve this we removed this warning from Tailwind CSS and are instead including it in the latest patch version of the `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` plugin (https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-line-clamp/pull/26).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this means that, unless the user updates to the latest version of the `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` plugin, we can no longer automatically disable the line-clamp plugin — which could result in having duplicated CSS entries for the line-clamp utilities.

I was changing the config to typescript and was noticing that the types for the `boxShadow` property seem to miss the option for arrays, even though it works, gets transpiled and works in the css custom property.

We are not interested in the dependencies that are listed in your `package.json` and thus in your `node_modules` folder.\n\nWe made the assumption that your imports have at least 3 characters. This sort of makes sense because there will be a `.`, then the OS separator like `/` and than a file name. E.g.: `./a` is the minimal amount of characters.\n\nThis makes sense for `import` statements, but in the case of `require`, it is totally valid to write `require('.')`. This will require the current `index.{js,ts,mjs,cjs,...}` in the current directory.\n\nBefore this change, having a `require('.')` wouldn't crash, but the dependency would not be marked as a module dependencies and therefore we won't listen for file changes for that dependency.\n\n<!--\n\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

If we can't safely do this, then we try to convert the `theme(…)` syntax (dot notation) to the modern `theme(…)` syntax (with CSS variable-like syntax).\n\n### Let's look at some examples:\n\n**Simple example:**\n\nInput:\n```html\n<div class=\"bg-[theme(colors.red.500)]\"></div>\n```\n\nOutput:\n```html\n<div class=\"bg-[var(--color-red-500)]\"></div>\n```\n\n---\n\n**With fallback:**\n\nInput:\n```html\n<div class=\"bg-[theme(colors.red.500,theme(colors.blue.500))]\"></div>\n```\n\nOutput:\n```html\n<div class=\"bg-[var(--color-red-500,var(--color-blue-500))]\"></div>\n```\n\n---\n\n**With modifiers:**\n\nInput:\n```html\n<div class=\"bg-[theme(colors.red.500/75%)]\"></div>\n```\n\nOutput:\n```html\n<div class=\"bg-[var(--color-red-500)]/75\"></div>\n```\n\nWe can special case this, because if you are using that modifier syntax we _assume_ it's being used in a `theme(…)` call referencing a color. This means that we can also convert it to a modifier on the actual candidate.\n\n---\n\n**With modifier, if a modifier is already present:**\n\nInput:\n```html\n<div class=\"bg-[theme(colors.red.500/75%)]/50\"></div>\n```\n\nOutput:\n```html\n<div class=\"bg-[theme(--color-red-500/75%)]/50\"></div>\n```\n\nIn this case we can't use the `var(…)` syntax because that requires us to move the opacity modifier to the candidate itself. In this case we could use math to figure out the expected modifier, but that might be too confusing. Instead, we convert to the modern `theme(…)` syntax.\n\n---\n\n**Multiple `theme(…)` calls with modifiers:**\n\nInput:\n```html\n<div class=\"bg-[theme(colors.red.500/75%,theme(colors.blue.500/50%))]\"></div>\n```\n\nOutput:\n```html\n<div class=\"bg-[theme(--color-red-500/75%,theme(--color-blue-500/50%))]\"></div>\n```\n\nIn this case we can't convert to `var(…)` syntax because then we lose the opacity modifier. We also can't move the opacity modifier to the candidate itself e.g.: `/50` because we have 2 different variables to worry about.\n\nIn this situation we convert to the modern `theme(…)` syntax itself.\n\n---\n\n**Inside variants:**\n\nInput:\n```html\n<div class=\"max-[theme(spacing.20)]:flex\"></div>\n```\n\nOutput:\n```html\n<div class=\"max-[theme(--spacing-20)]:flex\"></div>\n```\n\nUnfortunately we can't convert to `var(…)` syntax reliably because in some cases (like the one above) the value will be used inside of an `@media (…)` query and CSS doesn't support that at the time of writing this PR.\n\nSo to be safe, we will not try to convert `theme(…)` to `var(…)` in variants, but we will only upgrade the `theme(…)` call itself to modern syntax.\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14664","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Migrate `theme(…)` calls to `var(…)` or the modern `theme(…)` syntax\" (#14664)"},{"Id":"2588654198","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-16T14:06:09","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"14672","RawContent":null,"Title":"Reset `default` @theme values for non `extend` JS theme config","State":"closed","Body":"Imagine the following setup:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/* src/input.css */\r\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\r\n@config \"../tailwind.config.ts\";\r\n@theme {\r\n  --color-red-500: #ef4444;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n/* tailwind.config.ts */\r\nexport default {\r\n  theme: {\r\n    colors: {\r\n      red: {\r\n        600: '#dc2626'\r\n      } \r\n    },\r\n    extend: {\r\n      colors: {\r\n        400: '#f87171'\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the theme object in the JS config contains `colors` in the non-`extends` block, you would expect this to _not pull in all the default colors imported via `@import \"tailwindcss\";`_. This, however, wasn't the case right now since all theme options were purely _additive_ to the CSS.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes it so that non-`extend` theme keys _overwrite default CSS theme values_. The emphasis is on `default` here since you still want to be able to overwrite your options via `@theme {}` in user space.\r\n\r\nThis now generates the same CSS that our upgrade codemods would also generate as this would apply the new CSS right after the `@import \"tailwindcss\";` rule resulting in:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\r\n@theme {\r\n  --color-*: initial;\r\n  --color-red-400: #f87171;\r\n  --color-red-600: #dc2626;\r\n}\r\n@theme {\r\n  --color-red-500: #ef4444;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Keyframes\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a new core API to unset keyframes the same way. We previously had no option of doing that but while working on the above codemods we noticed that keyframes should behave the same way:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\r\n@theme {\r\n  --keyframes-*: initial;\r\n  @keyframes spin {\r\n    to {\r\n      transform: rotate(361deg);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo do this, the keyframes bookeeping was moved from the main Tailwind CSS v4 file into the `Theme` class. \r\n\r\n\r\n_I’m not sure super of the API yet but we would need a way for the codemods to behave the same as out interop layer here. Option B is that we don't reset keyframes the same way we reset other theme variables_.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14672","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Reset `default` @theme values for non `extend` JS theme config\" (#14672)"},{"Id":"2591626982","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-16T11:55:15","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"14687","RawContent":null,"Title":"`@apply` is not allowed inside `@keyframes`","State":"closed","Body":"This PR makes sure that you cannot use `@apply` inside `@keyframes`. \n\nWhile some utilities can be used in `@keyframes`, the moment you introduce a variant, that's not going to work anymore because they need to operate on selectors which `@keyframes` don't have.\n\nThis PR now removes all usages of `@apply` in `@keyframes`.\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14687","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"`@apply` is not allowed inside `@keyframes`\" (#14687)"},{"Id":"2591546444","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-16T11:25:53","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"14686","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add missing changelog entry","State":"closed","Body":"<!--\n\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

For example `theme(colors.red.500 / 50%)` will apply a 50% opacity to the `colors.red.500` value.\n\nHowever, if you used a variable instead of the hardcoded `50%` value, then this was not parsed correctly. E.g.: `theme(colors.red.500 / var(--opacity))`\n\n_If_ we have this exact syntax (with the spaces), then it parses, but some information is lost:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"bg-[theme(colors.red.500_/_var(--opacity))]\"></div>\n```\n\nResults in:\n```css\n.bg-\\[theme\\(colors\\.red\\.500_\\/_var\\(--opacity\\)\\)\\] {\n  background-color: color-mix(in srgb, #ef4444 calc(var * 100%), transparent);\n}\n```\nNotice that the `var(--opacity)` is just parsed as `var`, and the `--opacity` is lost.\n\nAdditionally, if we drop the spaces, then it doesn't parse at all:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"bg-[theme(colors.red.500/var(--opacity))]\"></div>\n```\n\nResults in:\n```css\n```\n\nThis means that we have to handle 2 issues to make this work:\n1.

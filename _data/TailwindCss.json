I have fought with ChatGPT and Gemini for 3 hours, providing all verbose outputs etc and they even got frustrated so I am not sure if I have missed something. Gemini made me submit this bug report in the end.

./scripts/install.js directly within node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide/ produces no output, even with set -x.\"\n\nPS:\n01.07. --- I am back onto it, disabled both Norton and Windows Defender (also Public Network) and Gemini confirmed the following:\n\"Therefore, the problem is absolutely, 100% with npm's process of handling that binary during installation.\"\n-----\nFirewalls still disabled, after \"npm install @tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu@4.1.11 --verbose\" Gemini says:\n\"This confirms the hang is happening during the phase where npm transitions from fetching package metadata to actually downloading the content (the .tgz files) of those specific oxide and lightningcss binary packages.\"\n--> it finished after some time, again with Exit-Code \"0\". Still no progress. Created a /bin in the project directory now and trying to manually fetch the binary. --> after 20 minutes Gemini was not able to locate a binary for manual download, seems like it is straight up impossible to get Tailwind to work on WSL2. Looking for an alternative of setting it up with Symfony and Vue now.\n-----\nLast edit for now, this is the summary of Gemini after roughly 5 hours in total of trying to get Tailwind to work on WSL2.\nAfter cd'ing to the .npm-directory and \"find ~/tailwind_test_isolated/node_modules -type f -name \"*tailwindcss-linux-x64*\" 2>/dev/null\" it confirms the binary indeed did not get downloaded anywhere on the disk.\n\n\nLet's clarify what's actually happening based on all the logs:\n\nThe binary is downloading: Your previous logs explicitly show npm http fetch GET 200 https://registry.npmjs.org/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu/-/oxide-linux-x64-gnu-4.1.11.tgz. This means the tarball containing the tailwindcss-linux-x64 executable is successfully being fetched to npm's cache. So, the binary exists and can be downloaded.\n\nThe problem is in the postinstall script: The @tailwindcss/oxide package has a postinstall script (node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide/scripts/install.js) that is supposed to extract this downloaded binary from the cache and place it into the correct location within your node_modules (likely node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide/dist/). The critical issue is that this script is reporting code: 0 (success) but is silently failing to actually perform this extraction/placement on your system.\n\nnpx tailwindcss won't work anyway (for v4 alpha): Even if the binary were placed correctly, the tailwindcss v4 packages do not include the standard bin field in their package.json files. This means npm and npx have no instruction on how to create a symlink or execute a command called tailwindcss. So, npx tailwindcss will always give \"could not determine executable to run\" with these alpha v4 packages, regardless of the binary's presence.\n\nTherefore, the problem boils down to: Why is the @tailwindcss/oxide/scripts/install.js script failing silently to extract and place the binary after it's downloaded?\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18417","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Tailwind CSS v4.x (@tailwindcss/oxide) native binary not installing on WSL2 / Win 11 Pro, postinstall script reports success but file is missing.\" (#18417)"},{"Id":"3190792124","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-01T13:23:44","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"18423","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update enhanced-resolve 5.18.1 → 5.18.2 (patch)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

After installing this version in a new project using:\n\n```\nnpm install -D tailwindcss@4.1.11\n````\n\n… I attempted to run the following:\n\n```\nnpx tailwindcss init\n```\n\nHowever, this consistently fails with the error:\n\n```\nnpm ERR! could not determine executable to run\n```\n\n### Investigation Findings:\n\n* The `tailwindcss` binary is **missing** from the `node_modules/.bin` directory.\n* Running `npm view tailwindcss@4.1.11 bin` returns **an empty result**, indicating that the published package may be missing the `bin` field in its `package.json`.\n* This behavior is **not present** in `v3.4.1`. After downgrading with:\n\n  ```\n  npm install -D tailwindcss@3.4.1\n  ```\n\n  … the CLI binary is correctly registered, and the following works:\n\n  ```\n  npx tailwindcss init\n  ```\n\n### Summary:\n\nIt appears that version `v4.1.11` of Tailwind CSS was published **without the CLI binary entry**, which breaks usage via `npx`, `npm exec`, or any other CLI-based workflows. This may have been an unintentional omission during publishing.\n\nPlease let me know if this was an intentional change or a packaging mistake. If needed, I’m happy to share logs, reproduce this issue further, or help test fixes.\n\nThanks for your time and continued work on Tailwind!\n\nBest regards,\nPrabhat","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18415","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Issue with Tailwind CSS Installation (Version 4.1.11) — Resolved with Version 3.4.1\" (#18415)"},{"Id":"3184902172","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-28T12:40:54","Actor":"DominicWrege","Number":"18412","RawContent":null,"Title":"documenation: v4 list-style-type does not work from example code","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

This is especially important as I use Angular Material, which forces their styles into the `<head>` earlier than application styles causing them to always win in a priority competition, and this behaviour cannot be changed.\n\nImportant being forced on `@apply` rules messes with complex custom classes (if you've ever tried to customise the browser's built-in slider input, you'll understand my pain), wherein instead of having my class reference a CSS variable and have that variable have sensible defaults that can simply be overridden with an inline style, i.e. \n```css\n// slider.css\n// exerpt from a much large class that has to separately handle mozilla and webkit, because sliders SUCK\n.slider {\n    // Mozilla track gradient (simulates a \"filling\" bar)\n        @apply [&::-moz-range-track]:bg-linear-to-r [&::-moz-range-track]:from-(--left-bar) [&::-moz-range-track]:via-(--right-bar) [&::-moz-range-track]:to-(--right-bar);\n        // Mozilla track value setter (allows 1 variable to control both pats of the fill)\n        @apply [&::-moz-range-track]:from-(percentage:--value) [&::-moz-range-track]:via-(percentage:--value) [&::-moz-range-track]:to-100%;\n}\n```\n\n```html\n// some-component.html\n<input type=\"range\" max=\"100\" class=\"slider\" [style.--value.%]=\"value\"  [value]=\"value\" />\n```\n\nWith v4 now I am forced to set the variable with `!important` in order to override the default value I have set at 50%\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18400","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Using important automatically applies it to utilites set via @apply in v4\" (#18400)"},{"Id":"3183057114","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-27T15:55:15","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"18404","RawContent":null,"Title":"Don't consider the global important state in `@apply`","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #18400\r\n\r\nIn v3 when you used `important: true` it did not affect `@apply`. However, in v4 it does and there's no way to make it *not*. This is definitely a bug and would be unexpected for users coming from v3 who use `@apply` and `important` together.\r\n\r\nBasically, the following code, along with the detected utility `flex` in source files…\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@import 'tailwindcss/utilities' important;\r\n.flex-explicitly-important {\r\n  @apply flex!;\r\n}\r\n.flex-not-important {\r\n  @apply flex;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n… would output this:\r\n```css\r\n.flex {\r\n  display: flex !important;\r\n}\r\n.flex-explicitly-important  {\r\n  display: flex !important;\r\n}\r\n.flex-not-important {\r\n  display: flex !important;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it's expected that `@apply` doesn't consider the \"global\" important state.

The issue occurs with custom variants (like my implementation of `focus-visible`) as well as built-in variants like `hover:`.\n\n\nIntelliSense's hover preview does get it right though:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8ecb265-c5ff-46c7-95c6-7ad6d4fac34e)\n\n## Expected behavior\nBoth ordering approaches should work and apply the styles correctly, regardless of whether the variant is placed before or after the arbitrary selector.\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18387","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Modifier order issue: variants before arbitrary not selectors fail to apply styles\" (#18387)"},{"Id":"3171399247","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-24T16:50:31","Actor":"ekko2665","Number":"18379","RawContent":null,"Title":"tailwindCSS not being  work in some android mobile","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

While we understand these are precompiled performance tools, some transparency or build options would help dev teams avoid security flagging on production servers.\n\nWhen deploying a Laravel 11 project using Tailwind CSS (via @tailwindcss/oxide) on a production server running ImunifyAV malware scanning, several files in the node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-* directories are repeatedly flagged as malware.\n\nThe affected files are native .node binaries such as: \n\n```node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu/oxide.linux-x64-gnu.node```\n```node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-musl/oxide.linux-x64-musl.node```\n\n---\n\n ```httpdocs/node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-musl/tailwindcss-oxide.linux-x64-musl.node```\n ```httpdocs/node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu/tailwindcss-oxide.linux-x64-gnu.node```\n```httpdocs/node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu/oxide.linux-x64-gnu.node```\n```httpdocs/node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-musl/oxide.linux-x64-musl.node```\n```httpdocs/node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-musl/tailwindcss-oxide.linux-x64-musl.node```\n```httpdocs/node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu/tailwindcss-oxide.linux-x64-gnu.node```\n```httpdocs/node_modules/@tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-musl/oxide.linux-x64-musl.node```\n\n---\n\n🧨 Problem Summary\n\nThis isn’t just an issue with Tailwind’s JIT binaries (oxide). Rollup — the JavaScript bundler that many frontend frameworks use (including Vite, which Laravel 11 defaults to) — is also shipping native .node binaries that are being flagged as malware by ImunifyAV.\n\n---\n\n**My Concerns**\n\nDoes this make any websites that use this tailwind library to become vulnerable?  ImunifyAV is saying they contain malware. Is it a false positive? On my side I ran the scan about 8 times and it came back with the same thing each time. I have always used tailwind and it would be ashame to have to move away from it due to these security issues. \n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18366","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"According to imunifyAV this may contain malware\" (#18366)"},{"Id":"3164470054","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-21T19:40:11","Actor":"kilavvy","Number":"18361","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix: Correct typo in comment","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request contains a couple of minor documentation fixes.\r\n\r\n- Corrected a typo from `predicable` to `predictable` in a comment for `DarkModeStrategy`.\r\n- Applied minor formatting to a comment in a test file.\r\n\r\nThese changes help improve code clarity and maintainability.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18361","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix: Correct typo in comment\" (#18361)"},{"Id":"3165166324","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-21T15:37:51","Actor":"danielehrhardt","Number":"18363","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support Angular Scss with Tailwind 4","State":"closed","Body":"Support Angular Scss with Tailwind 4","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18363","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Support Angular Scss with Tailwind 4\" (#18363)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-07-02T03:30:23.1166296Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":493}

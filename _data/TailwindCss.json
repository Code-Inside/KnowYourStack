It turns out that in some projects (see #15250 for the exact repro), the way we invoke `svelte-preprocess` was actually causing issues in Vite since with Vite, it's expected to use the `sveltePreprocess` version exported by `sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte`.\r\n\r\nWhile trying to change this we noticed that there are different versions of `sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` for Vite 5 and Vite 6 which caused us to investigate even more and we noticed that we do not even need to recursively call into the `sveltePreprocess()` as every plugin is run after each other anyways.

The process completed without errors, but the styles are no longer applied after the migration.\r\n\r\nInitially, I suspected the issue might be related to the prefix configuration, so I created a separate branch (no-prefix) to test the migration without a prefix. Unfortunately, the result was the same.\r\n\r\nHere are the relevant branches in the reproduction repository:\r\n- main: Stable working version on Tailwind v3\r\n- tailwind-4: Migrated to Tailwind v4 (non-functional)\r\n- no-prefix: Migrated to Tailwind v4 without prefix (non-functional)\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce:**\r\n1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/dcheglakov/angular-tailwind.\r\n1. Check out the tailwind-4 or no-prefix branch.\r\n1. Build and serve the Angular app.\r\n1. Notice that the styles are not applied.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nThe styles should work as they did in Tailwind CSS v3 after the migration process.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\nI followed the migration steps provided in the [Tailwind CSS upgrade guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide). Both the tailwind-4 and no-prefix branches demonstrate the issue.

In v3, you could extend the theme to add more variants by using an object syntax like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n{\r\n   theme: {\r\n    extend: {\r\n      aria: {\r\n        polite: 'live=\"polite\"',\r\n      },\r\n      supports: {\r\n        'child-combinator': 'h2 > p',\r\n      },\r\n      data: {\r\n        checked: 'ui~=\"checked\"',\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince we no longer rely on theme variables for these variants, the way to make this work is by adding custom variants for each of these manually added variants.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14407","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Create variants for `aria`, `supports`, and `data` JS config theme keys\" (#14407)"},{"Id":"2521106405","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-12T01:17:09","Actor":"adamwathan","Number":"14403","RawContent":null,"Title":"Don't override explicit `leading-*`, `tracking-*`, or `font-{weight}` utilities with font-size utility defaults","State":"open","Body":"This PR improves how the `text-{size}` utilities interact with the `leading-*`, `tracking-*`, and `font-{weight}` utilities, ensuring that if the user explicitly uses any of those utilities that those values are not squashed by any defaults baked into the `text-{size}` utilities.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, if you wrote something like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"text-lg leading-none md:text-2xl\">\r\n```\r\n\r\n…the `leading-none` class would be overridden by the default line-height value baked into the `text-2xl` utility at the `md` breakpoint. This has been a point of confusion and frustration for people [in the past](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/6504) who are annoyed they have to keep repeating their custom `leading-*` value like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"text-lg leading-none md:text-2xl md:leading-none lg:text-4xl lg:leading-none\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR lets you write this HTML instead but get the same behavior as above:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"text-lg leading-none md:text-2xl lg:text-4xl\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that this change _only_ applies to line-height values set explicitly with a `leading-*` utility, and does not apply to the line-height modifier.\r\n\r\nIn this example, the line-height set by `text-sm/6` does _not_ override the default line-height included in the `md:text-lg` utility:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"text-sm/6 md:text-lg\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat means these two code snippets behave differently:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"text-sm/6 md:text-lg\">…</div>\r\n<div class=\"text-sm leading-6 md:text-lg\">…</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the top one, the line-height `md:text-lg` overrides the line-height set by `text-sm/6`, but in the bottom one, the explicit `leading-6` utility takes precedence.\r\n\r\nThis PR applies the same improvements to `tracking-*` and `font-{weight}` as well, since all font size utilities can also optionally specify default `letter-spacing` and `font-weight` values.\r\n\r\nWe achieve this using new semi-private CSS variables like we do for things like transforms, shadows, etc., which are set by the `leading-*`, `tracking-*`, and `font-{weight}` utilities respectively. The `text-{size}` utilities always use these values first if they are defined, and the default values become fallbacks for those variables if they aren't present.\r\n\r\nWe use `@property` to make sure these variables are reset to `initial` on a per element basis so that they are never inherited, like with every other variable we define.\r\n\r\nThis PR does slightly increase the amount of CSS generated, because now utilities like `leading-5` look like this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n  .leading-5 {\r\n+   --tw-leading: 1.25rem;\r\n    line-height: 1.25rem;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n…and utilites like `text-sm` include a `var(…)` lookup that they didn't include before:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n  .text-sm {\r\n    font-size: 0.875rem;\r\n-   line-height: var(--font-size-sm--line-height, 1.25rem);\r\n+   line-height: var(--tw-leading, var(--font-size-sm--line-height, 1.25rem));\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this extra CSS doesn't feel worth it for the small improvement in behavior, we may consider just closing this PR and keeping things as they are.\r\n\r\nThis PR is also a breaking change for anyone who was depending on the old behavior, and expected the line-height baked into the `md:text-lg` class to take precedence over the explicit `leading-6` class:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"text-sm leading-6 md:text-lg\">…</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nPersonally I am comfortable with this because of the fact that you can still get the old behavior by preferring a line-height modifier:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"text-sm/6 md:text-lg\">…</div>\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14403","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Don't override explicit `leading-*`, `tracking-*`, or `font-{weight}` utilities with font-size utility defaults\" (#14403)"},{"Id":"2520451994","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-11T18:28:52","Actor":"olets","Number":"14401","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v3] using a class with a variant generates css for the variant-free class too","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

The goal of this PR is to make the automatic source detection configurable, let's dig in.\n\nBy default, we will perform automatic source detection starting at the current working directory. Auto source detection will find plain text files (no binaries, images, ...) and will ignore git-ignored files.\n\nIf you want to start from a different directory, you can use the new `source(…)` next to the `@import \"tailwindcss/utilities\" layer(utilities) source(…)`.\n\nE.g.:\n\n```css\n/* ./src/styles/index.css */\n@import 'tailwindcss/utilities' layer(utilities) source('../../');\n```\n\nMost people won't split their source files, and will just use the simple `@import \"tailwindcss\";`, because of this reason, you can use `source(…)` on the import as well:\n\nE.g.:\n\n```css\n/* ./src/styles/index.css */\n@import 'tailwindcss' source('../../');\n```\n\nSometimes, you want to rely on auto source detection, but also want to look in another directory for source files. In this case, yuo can use the `@source` directive:\n\n```css\n/* ./src/index.css */\n@import 'tailwindcss';\n\n/* Look for `blade.php` files in `../resources/views` */\n@source '../resources/views/**/*.blade.php';\n```\n\nHowever, you don't need to specify the extension, instead you can just point the directory and all the same automatic source detection rules will apply.\n\n```css\n/* ./src/index.css */\n@import 'tailwindcss';\n\n@source '../resources/views';\n```\n\nIf, for whatever reason, you want to disable the default source detection feature entirely, and only want to rely on very specific glob patterns you define, then you can disable it via `source(none)`.\n\n```css\n/* Completely disable the default auto source detection */\n@import 'tailwindcss' source(none);\n\n/* Only look at .blade.php files, nothing else  */\n@source \"../resources/views/**/*.blade.php\";\n```\n\nNote: even with `source(none)`, if your `@source` points to a directory, then auto source detection will still be performed in that directory. If you don't want that, then you can simply add explicit files in the globs as seen in the previous example.\n\n```css\n/* Completely disable the default auto source detection */\n@import 'tailwindcss' source(none);\n\n/* Run auto source detection in `../resources/views` */\n@source \"../resources/views\";\n```\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14820","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Auto source detection improvements\" (#14820)"},{"Id":"2619687458","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-29T11:41:10","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"14815","RawContent":null,"Title":"Handle `source(none)` in Vite","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14815","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Handle `source(none)` in Vite\" (#14815)"},{"Id":"2619687362","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-29T11:41:00","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"14814","RawContent":null,"Title":"`@source` globs should apply auto source detection","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14814","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"`@source` globs should apply auto source detection\" (#14814)"},{"Id":"2620659439","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-29T09:29:57","Actor":"rj-elias","Number":"14819","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] clearing namespace for corePlugin doesn't work","State":"open","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\nv4.0.0-alpha.30\r\n\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\n\r\nhttps://play.tailwindcss.com/bjEOmfVaL9\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@theme {\r\n  --background-color-*: initial; /* DO NOT WORK: doesn't clear the background color namespace */\r\n  --background-color-brand: blue; /* WORKS: extends the background color namespace with brand */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`--background-color-brand: blue;` works.

We often do this with code that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nrule.selector[0] === '@' && rule.selector.startsWith('@media')\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother issue we have is that we often need to check for `'@media '` including the space, because we don't want to match `@mediafoobar` if somebody has this in their CSS. Alternatively, if you CSS is minified then it could be that you have a rule that looks like `@media(width>=100px)`, in this case we _also_ have to check for `@media(`.\r\n\r\nHere is a snippet of code that we have in our codebase:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\n// Find at-rules rules\r\nif (node.kind === 'rule') {\r\n  if (\r\n    node.selector[0] === '@' &&\r\n    (node.selector.startsWith('@media ') ||\r\n      node.selector.startsWith('@media(') ||\r\n      node.selector.startsWith('@custom-media ') ||\r\n      node.selector.startsWith('@custom-media(') ||\r\n      node.selector.startsWith('@container ') ||\r\n      node.selector.startsWith('@container(') ||\r\n      node.selector.startsWith('@supports ') ||\r\n      node.selector.startsWith('@supports(')) &&\r\n    node.selector.includes(THEME_FUNCTION_INVOCATION)\r\n  ) {\r\n    node.selector = substituteFunctionsInValue(node.selector, resolveThemeValue)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich will now be replaced with a much simpler version:\r\n```ts\r\n// Find at-rules rules\r\nif (node.kind === 'at-rule') {\r\n  if (\r\n    (node.name === '@media' ||\r\n      node.name === '@custom-media' ||\r\n      node.name === '@container' ||\r\n      node.name === '@supports') &&\r\n    node.params.includes(THEME_FUNCTION_INVOCATION)\r\n  ) {\r\n    node.params = substituteFunctionsInValue(node.params, resolveThemeValue)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nChecking for all the cases from the first snippet is not the end of the world, but it is error prone. It's easy to miss a case.\r\n\r\nA direct comparison is also faster than comparing via the `startsWith(…)` function.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote: this is only a refactor without changing other code _unless_ it was required to make the tests pass. The tests themselves are all passing and none of them changed (because the behavior should be the same).\r\nThe one exception is the tests where we check the parsed AST, which now includes `at-rule` nodes instead of `rule` nodes when we have an at-rule.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14802","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Internal refactor, introduce `AtRule`\" (#14802)"},{"Id":"2619823868","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-29T00:09:45","Actor":"rajatgupta-dev","Number":"14816","RawContent":null,"Title":"Tailwind cdn url is not working","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

utilities","State":"closed","Body":"This PR updates all of our x/y named utilities (like `px-*`, `my-*`, `inset-y-*`, `scroll-px-*`, etc.) to use logical properties like `padding-inline` instead of separate `padding-left` and `padding-right` properties.\r\n\r\nWe held off on this originally for a while because `inline` doesn't really mean _horizontal_ like the \"x\" in `px-*` implies, but I think in practice this change is fine — I'm comfortable with \"x\" meaning \"in the inline direction\" and \"y\" meaning \"in the block direction\" in Tailwind.\r\n\r\nThis is technically a breaking change if anyone was depending on the fact that `px-*` for instance was always explicitly setting `padding-left` and `padding-right` even when building something in a vertical writing mode, but I kinda doubt there's a single real project on the internet that will actually be affected, so not too worried about it.\r\n\r\nIf someone _really_ wants to set `padding-left` and `padding-right` they can always use `pl-4 pr-4` instead of `px-4`.\r\n\r\nNice thing about this change is it produces quite a bit less CSS.\r\n\r\nTo test this change, I re-generated all of the snapshots and made sure none of the generated utilities changed position or anything in the output (initially they did before I updated `property-order.ts` to add some missing properties).\r\n\r\nI also created a little demo locally in the Vite playground to test things manually and make sure I didn't make any obvious typos or anything that could slip through the snapshots:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1223\" alt=\"image\"

This PR also ensures that the upgrade tool is idempotent, meaning that it can be run multiple times and it should result in the same output.\r\n\r\nOne awesome feature this unlocks is that you can run the upgrade tool on your codebase at any time and upgrade classes if you still have some legacy syntaxes, such as `bg-[var(--my-color)]`, in your muscle memory.\r\n\r\nOne small note: If something changed in the first run, re-running will not work immediately because your git repository will not be clean and the upgrade tool requires your git repo to be clean. But once you verified and committed your changes, the upgrade tool will be idempotent.\r\n\r\nIdempotency is guaranteed by ensuring that some migrations are skipped by checking what version of Tailwind CSS you are on _before_ the version is upgraded.\r\n\r\nFor the Tailwind CSS version: We will resolve `tailwindcss` itself to know the _actual_ version that is installed (the one resolved from `node_modules`). Not the one available in your package.json. Your `package.json` could be out of sync if you reverted changes but didn't run `npm install` yet.\r\n\r\nBack to Idempotency:\r\n\r\nFor example, we have migrations where we change the variant order of stacked variants. If we would run these migrations every time you run the upgrade tool then we would be flip-flopping the order every run.\r\n\r\nSee: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide#variant-stacking-order\r\n\r\nAnother example is where we rename some utilities. For example, we rename:\r\n\r\n| Before      | After       |\r\n| ----------- | ----------- |\r\n| `shadow`    | `shadow-sm` |\r\n| `shadow-sm` | `shadow-xs` |\r\n\r\nNotice how we have `shadow-sm` in both the `before` and `after` column.\r\n\r\nIf we would run the upgrade tool again, then we would eventually migrate your original `shadow` to `shadow-sm` (first run) and then to `shadow-xs` (second run). Which would result in the wrong shadow.\r\n\r\nSee: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide#renamed-utilities\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe order of upgrade steps changed a bit as well to make the internals are easier to work with and reason about.\r\n\r\n1. Find CSS files\r\n2. Link JS config files (if you are in a Tailwind CSS v3 project)\r\n3. Migrate the JS config files (if you are in a Tailwind CSS v3 project)\r\n4. Upgrade Tailwind CSS to v4 (or the latest version at that point)\r\n5. Migrate the stylesheets (we used to migrate the source files first)\r\n6. Migrate the source files\r\n\r\nThis is done so that step 5 and 6 will always operate on a Tailwind CSS v4 project and we don't need to check the version number again. This is also necessary because your CSS file will now very likely contain `@import \"tailwindcss\";` which doesn't exist in Tailwind CSS v3.\r\n\r\nThis also means that we can rely on the same internals that Tailwind CSS actually uses for locating the source files. We will use `@tailwindcss/oxide`'s scanner to find the source files (and it also keeps your custom `@source` directives into account).\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduces a few actual migrations related to recent features and changes we shipped.\r\n\r\n1.

If at the end of the migrations the original candidate is still the same as the new candidate, then we will parse & print the candidate one more time to pretty print into consistent classes. Luckily parsing is cached so there is no real downside overhead.\r\n\r\nConsistency (especially with arbitrary variants and values) will reduce your CSS file because there will be fewer \"versions\" of your class.\r\n\r\nConcretely, the pretty printing will apply changes such as:\r\n\r\n| Before                 | After             |\r\n| ---------------------- | ----------------- |\r\n| `bg-[var(--my-color)]` | `bg-(--my-color)` |\r\n| `bg-[rgb(0,_0,_0)]`    | `bg-[rgb(0,0,0)]` |\r\n\r\nAnother big important reason for this change is that these classes on their own\r\nwould have been migrated _if_ another migration was relevant for this candidate.\r\nThis means that there are were some inconsistencies. E.g.:\r\n\r\n| Before                  | After                  | Reason                               |\r\n| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |\r\n| `!bg-[var(--my-color)]` | `bg-(--my-color)!`     | Because the `!` is in the wrong spot |\r\n| `bg-[var(--my-color)]`  | `bg-[var(--my-color)]` | Because no migrations rand           |\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the way the `--my-color` variable is used, is different. This\r\nchanges will make sure it will now always be consistent:\r\n| Before | After |\r\n| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |\r\n| `!bg-[var(--my-color)]` | `bg-(--my-color)!` |\r\n| `bg-[var(--my-color)]` | `bg-(--my-color)` |\r\n\r\nYay!\r\n\r\nOf course, if you don't want these more cosmetic changes, you can always ignore the upgrade and revert these changes and only commit the changes you want.\r\n\r\n# Test plan\r\n\r\n- All existing tests still pass.\r\n  - But I had to delete 1 test (we tested that Tailwind CSS v3 was required).\r\n  - And had to mock the `version.isMajor` call to ensure we run the individual migration tests correctly.\r\n- Added new tests to test:\r\n  1. Migrating Tailwind CSS v4 projects works\r\n  1.

Start the dev server and check that Tailwind styling is applied (https://localhost:3000/posts):\n   ```\n   bin/dev\n   ```\n   \n   <img width=\"843\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-04-16 at 11 44 38 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1629ee36-58bf-45fd-80ec-0102de96e7fa\" />\n\n5. Build and push a Docker image for ARM64:\n   ```\n   docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64 -t kyrylo/tailwind-on-arm:latest --push .\n   ```\n6. On an ARM server (I use Hetzner CAX11), install Docker, then run the image:\n   ```\n   docker run -d -p 80:80 -e RAILS_MASTER_KEY=90279f1e5d289cb437ba0c2f959a2ea5 --name tailwind_on_arm kyrylo/tailwind-on-arm\n   ```\n7. Check the result at `http://<IP-ADDRESS>/posts` and notice that Tailwind styling is not applied:\n   | Screenshot | application.css |\n   |------------|-----------------|\n   | <img width=\"843\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-04-16 at 11 44 53 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3146703d-df20-4a24-a566-96e325df2723\" /> | <img width=\"790\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-04-16 at 11 49 39 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1da77e59-d900-4730-8400-2c70fe2fccec\" /> |\n   \n---\n\nI'm happy to help debug this further.

The same binary instead works fine on a MacBook Air equipped with the **2.2 Ghz Intel Core i7 dual-core CPU**. \nThe only significant hardware difference is that the Intel Core i7 Quad-Core CPU supports **three fewer CPU instructions** compared to the Intel Core i7 Dual-Core CPU.\nOlder Tailwind versions (<4.0) runs regularly on the older i7 CPU.\n\n### Steps to Reproduce:\n1. Download the tailwind-macos-x64 binary from the Tailwind 4.0.9 release (actually, any >=4.0).\n2. On a system with a processor lacking certain advanced instructions (e.g., an older iMac), run, for example, the following command:\n```bash\n$ ./tailwind-macos-x64 --help\n```\n3. The command returns:\n```yaml\nIllegal instruction: 4\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior:\nThe binary should execute normally without producing an illegal instruction error.\n\n### Observed Behavior:\nOn the affected iMac, the command fails with:\n```yaml\nIllegal instruction: 4\n```\n\nIn contrast, on a MacBook Air with a newer Intel Core i7 that supports the necessary instructions, the same binary executes as expected:\n\n``` bash\n$ tailwind-macos-x64 --help\n≈ tailwindcss v4.0.9\n\nUsage:\n  tailwindcss [--input input.css] [--output output.css] [--watch] [options…]\n\nOptions:\n  -i, --input ··········· Input file\n  -o, --output ·········· Output file [default: `-`]\n  -w, --watch ··········· Watch for changes and rebuild as needed\n  -m, --minify ·········· Optimize and minify the output\n      --optimize ········ Optimize the output without minifying\n      --cwd ············· The current working directory [default: `.`]\n  -h, --help ············ Display usage information\n```\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\nRunning `sysctl -a | grep machdep.cpu.features` on both machines shows that the iMac's CPU is missing three instruction sets that are present on the MacBook Air’s CPU.\n```bash\n# Intel Core i7 quad-core\n$ sysctl -a | grep machdep.cpu.features\nmachdep.cpu.features: FPU VME DE PSE TSC MSR PAE MCE CX8 APIC SEP MTRR PGE MCA CMOV PAT PSE36 CLFSH DS ACPI MMX FXSR SSE SSE2 SS HTT TM PBE SSE3 PCLMULQDQ DTES64 MON DSCPL VMX SMX EST TM2 SSSE3 CX16 TPR PDCM SSE4.1 SSE4.2 x2APIC POPCNT AES PCID XSAVE OSXSAVE TSCTMR AVX1.0 RDRAND F16C\n\n# Intel Core i7 dual-core\n$ sysctl -a | grep machdep.cpu.features\nmachdep.cpu.features: FPU VME DE PSE TSC MSR PAE MCE CX8 APIC SEP MTRR PGE MCA CMOV PAT PSE36 CLFSH DS ACPI MMX FXSR SSE SSE2 SS HTT TM PBE SSE3 PCLMULQDQ DTES64 MON DSCPL VMX SMX EST TM2 SSSE3 FMA CX16 TPR PDCM SSE4.1 SSE4.2 x2APIC MOVBE POPCNT AES PCID XSAVE OSXSAVE SEGLIM64 TSCTMR AVX1.0 RDRAND F16C\n\n# Differences:  FMA, MOVBE, SEGLIM64\n\n```\n\nThe issue does not occur with Tailwind 3.0, indicating that version 4.0 may have been compiled with optimizations that require advanced CPU instructions not available on the older processor.\n\n### Potential Solutions:\n\nProvide a variant of the binary compiled with optimizations compatible with older processors or with fallback options for unsupported CPU instructions.\nOffer a configuration option during the build process to target a wider range of CPU instruction sets.\n\nI appreciate your attention to this issue and look forward to any guidance or solutions you can provide.\n\nThank you!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17691","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"tailwind-macos-x64 binary >=4.0 fails with \"Illegal instruction: 4\" on older Intel CPUs\" (#17691)"},{"Id":"2998274322","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-16T03:59:37","Actor":"kocv59","Number":"17695","RawContent":null,"Title":"space-x- and space-y- breaking change","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

Falling back to inline is not an option for us, because the project then will not be maintainable and the code not readable.\n\nIn tailwindcss 3, the apply did not create such issues, because we didn't have to use @reference to use it.\n\nNow it takes around 5-10 seconds to show a letter change from a vue component over vite, it's like going back to webpack 😆 \n\nYes, I have read the documentation that we could use var(--bg-blue-500) or something, but then we can't use spacings, breakspoints etc, all the benefits of tailwind.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17693","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"@reference causing re-renders in non related component with HMR\" (#17693)"},{"Id":"2997271661","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-15T18:34:40","Actor":"FLCN-16","Number":"17692","RawContent":null,"Title":"[4.1.4] Getting parser error : Cannot convert undefined or null to object","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

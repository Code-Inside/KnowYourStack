We are used to working with numbers as breakpoints as you can see in the screenshot below and we would like to keep using this as it's easier when there is a need to add an extra breakpoint. \r\n\r\n![Screenshot breakpoints](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69677343/207865029-2b4f5a0e-4227-4ab6-8f0b-1d3229d633b3.png)\r\n\r\nWe wrote some custom plugins to be able to define text styles like for example h1, in this way we can use typo-h1 which sets the right properties for font-family, font-size, line-height, etc. We also made them responsive. \r\nBy using numbers as breakpoints in the config file, we noticed that Tailwind puts the media queries defined in the tailwind config at the top which results in media queries being set before the default values. (see screenshots below - 1. tailwind config file - 2. console log of the config file in a custom plugin function)\r\n\r\n![tailwind config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69677343/207866172-1acce28d-c444-4517-8fc5-9aa0e62fbbc8.png)\r\n\r\n![console log tailwind config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69677343/207866187-acee24c5-59a8-4a9f-8e00-1490c1cca27b.png)\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n1. Use numbers as screen sizes\r\n2. Add an object in the tailwind config file, using a number\r\n3.

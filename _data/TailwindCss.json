I intend to display the menu on the screen larger than 896px and hidden otherwise:\n```\n<div className=\"hidden ml-2 ml:flex ml:text-cyan-500\">\n    <NavMenu onLinkClick={handleLinkClick} />\n</div>\n```\n\nHowever, the `div` does not show up on `ml` breakpoint. The other classes e.g. `ml:text-cyan-500` work, but not `ml:flex`.\n\nOn hovering over `ml:flex`, the generated CSS seems to be correct:\n```\n.ml\\:flex {\n    @media (width >= 56rem /* 896px */) {\n        display: flex;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nI tried using `min-[56rem]:flex` and it seems to be working.\n```\n<div className=\"hidden ml-2 min-[56rem]:flex ml:text-cyan-500\">\n    <NavMenu onLinkClick={handleLinkClick} />\n</div>\n```\n\nDo you have any idea what's wrong here?

All of DaisyUI seems to be added to the app/assets/builds/tailwind.css output file.\n\nMy theory is that Tailwind is interpreting the daisyui.js file as a source file of the project because it doesn't fall into any of the rules of files [ignored by Tailwind's scanner](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/detecting-classes-in-source-files#which-files-are-scanned).\n\nThe resulting file weighs 177kb. If I comment @plugin ./daisiui.js the file weighs 8kb.\n\nI recently opened an issue in DaisyUI due to this same problem and it was determined that the source of it is most likely Tailwind.  https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui/issues/3621\n\nTo fix the issue I had to ignore all sources and add them manually\nhttps://github.com/pinzonjulian/daisy-bug/compare/main...set-explicit-sources\n\nIt seems to me that Tailwind could automatically ignore plugin's path to prevent this from happening. If not, users are forced to list all paths manually which kind of goes against the objective of the new engine.\n\nThanks!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17058","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Plugin in source code is picked up as application code in Standalone CLI mode\" (#17058)"},{"Id":"2904625054","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-08T07:54:39","Actor":"Autumnal-Joy","Number":"17054","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bug: Detecting classes in source files causes crash","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

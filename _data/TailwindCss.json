Upgrading to v4 was seamless for this, we were able to build and publish the design system.\r\n\r\nWhen using the design system in the monorepo in a Next.js project we're transpiling the components (rather than using the built version).\r\n\r\nI noticed that the styles were not being generated, I assumed this was because the automatic detection was not picking it up. Looking at the config code, it seems like we should be passing through the `base` as the config variable based on the config:\r\n```\r\ntype PluginOptions = {\r\n  // The base directory to scan for class candidates.\r\n  base?: string\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt first I tried putting in `\"../..\"` so that it would map to a relative root directory, but it seems like the only way to use base is with an absolute path eg `\"/Users/me/Code/monorepo/\" which does work.\r\n\r\nIt would just be nice to be able to use a relative directory here so that when we look at deploying/cloning the repo it's not hard coded to a user directory.\r\n\r\nI imagine this might be solved when:\r\n> We’ll introduce a way to configure content paths explicitly in the future for sure, but we’re curious to see how well this automatic approach works for everyone — it’s working awesome in our own projects.\r\n\r\nSo feel free to also close this and I can be patient 😅 ","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13136","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"v4: Automatic content detection in monorepos only finds direct package\" (#13136)"},{"Id":"2174708718","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-07T20:16:29","Actor":"jcbhmr","Number":"13133","RawContent":null,"Title":"v4 alpha does not work on Stackblitz","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

For example in the tailwindcss.com codebase, this reduces incremental build times from 40ms to 30ms.\n\nIn the CLI build, the following flags are available:\n\n- `--minify` — this will optimize the CSS output and minify it.\n- `--optimize` — this will optimize the CSS output but **not** minify it.\n\nIn the Vite plugin, the Lightning CSS optimizations are only enabled for production builds.\n\nIn the PostCSS plugin, we added a new option `optimize` that can be used to enable the optimizations.\n\n```ts\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: {\n    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {\n      // This will optimize and minify the CSS output.\n      optimize: true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```ts\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: {\n    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {\n      optimize: {\n        // This will optimize but not minify the CSS output.\n        minify: false\n      } \n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<!--\n\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

I've actually had similiar ideas with [winduum.dev](https://winduum.dev), utilizing CSS properties, color-mix etc. via [TailwindCSS plugin](https://github.com/winduum/winduum/blob/main/plugin/index.js)\r\n\r\nI just had a quick look at v4 locally and maybe found a bug, but not sure though, could be also inteded.\r\n\r\nCurrently the CSS properties defined in `@theme` are not used in the utility classes? I would expect it to work this way since the properties are defined in `:root` for usage. Wouldn't they be redundant this way if not used in custom CSS?\r\n\r\nSo when defining properties like this\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@theme {\r\n    --color-primary: blue;\r\n    --color-secondary: red;\r\n    --font-weight-bold: 700;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would expect the result be\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.text-primary {\r\n    color: var(--color-primary);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.text-secondary {\r\n    color: var(--color-secondary);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.font-bold {\r\n    font-weight: var(--font-weight-bold);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows more control over the utilities, you could for example change the color if needed from the parent with [--color-primary:red], or on hover etc.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to define CSS properties in `@theme` now, but you would have to define them in :root elsewhere and that seems redundant.\r\n\r\nAlso just wondering why introducing the `@theme` at-rule? Wouldn't be better just use the layer theme and properties defined in there under :root or :host? Seems more CSS friendly, also opens possibilities like `@import \"custom-theme.css\" layer(theme);`","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13114","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[v4] Missing CSS properties in utility classes \" (#13114)"},{"Id":"2172317674","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-06T20:00:27","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"13113","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] Bump versions to `4.0.0-alpha.4`","State":"closed","Body":"This PR preps the packages for a next alpha release.\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

Upon investigating, I discovered that the styles defined in \"preflight.css\" take precedence over other TailwindCSS styles. To illustrate this problem, \"preflight.css\" sets that \"h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6\" inherit the font size through the style \"font-size: inherit\". This means that if you assign the \"text-3xl\" class to an \"h1\" element, the style intended by \"text-3xl\" is overridden by the one established in \"preflight.css\".","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13112","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[v4] The \"preflight.css\" file has more priority than it should have!?\" (#13112)"},{"Id":"2172232035","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-06T19:56:52","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"13110","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] add extension-less exports for all exported CSS files","State":"closed","Body":"This PR fixes an issue where in some tools imports such as `@import \"tailwindcss/preflight\"` don't work, they only work if you use `@import \"tailwindcss/preflight.css\"` with the extension.\n\nThis PR should solve that by also exporting these files but without the `.css` extension.\n<!--\n\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

I doubt it, it seems pointless to me.\r\n\r\n## Why do we have rem units?\r\n\r\nIf the websites are using rem units for font-sizes, then the users can change the default browser font-size in case they have poor eyesight, which allows them to consume content easier on the internet. This is literally the only reason we have rem units!\r\n\r\nMost web developers probably have perfect eyesight because changing the default browser font-size most of the time either has no effect or it zooms the websites. This makes this setting rather useless since pretty much every browser has a dedicated default zoom feature anyway, and the browser zoom can easily be overwritten by the user, for example, with ctrl+wheel.\r\n\r\nI don't really understand why most developers use this unit incorrectly. The only change needed when the rem units became supported was to change some font-size to rem instead of pixels. This is pretty much a ~30 line change in CSS for complex websites. Instead, the developers decided to either overwrite the root font-size so they can pointlessly use rem units just because they read somewhere that they should, or they don't overwrite it but use rem everywhere again just to lose its intended functionality.\r\n\r\nWhy did the Tailwind developers think that it would be a good idea to change the border width on a button, a shadow under a card, or the distance between nav items just because the user has changed the default font-size?\r\n\r\n## What would be the effect of this change?\r\n\r\nCurrently, changing the browser default font-size just zooms exactly like how the browser can zoom.\r\n\r\nIf the spacing units were to change to pixels, nothing would change if the user didn't touch the default font-size. Pretty much every Tailwind website would look exactly the same. However, if the user has changed the default font-size, for example, to 20 pixels, this would mean that most Tailwind websites would show text in 125% size instead of zooming the websites to 125%. This should be the intended effect of changing the default font-size, not a redundant zoom.\r\n\r\nTailwind is popular, so if the spacing units were to change to pixels instead of rem in Tailwind, that would instantly solve this problem on countless websites.\r\n\r\nWould this break websites? Maybe, there are surely websites where the root font-size has been overwritten for some reason, but pretty much all of these websites use rem incorrectly. There are probably also websites where they overwrite the root font-size but also allow the user to change it with a button or something. Currently, this button in these websites zooms the content, and after the change, it would have the probably intended effect of changing the font-size (this is a positive effect in my opinion).\r\n\r\nThe users who decide to change the default font-size would have a better experience on the internet.\r\n\r\n## What needs to be changed?\r\n\r\nThe default config should have this theme.spacing property: \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nspacing: {\r\n\tpx: '1px',\r\n\t0: '0px',\r\n\t0.5: '2px',\r\n\t1: '4px',\r\n\t1.5: '6px',\r\n\t2: '8px',\r\n\t2.5: '10px',\r\n\t3: '12px',\r\n\t3.5: '14px',\r\n\t4: '16px',\r\n\t5: '20px',\r\n\t6: '24px',\r\n\t7: '28px',\r\n\t8: '32px',\r\n\t9: '36px',\r\n\t10: '40px',\r\n\t11: '44px',\r\n\t12: '48px',\r\n\t14: '56px',\r\n\t16: '64px',\r\n\t20: '80px',\r\n\t24: '96px',\r\n\t28: '112px',\r\n\t32: '128px',\r\n\t36: '144px',\r\n\t40: '160px',\r\n\t44: '176px',\r\n\t48: '192px',\r\n\t52: '208px',\r\n\t56: '224px',\r\n\t60: '240px',\r\n\t64: '256px',\r\n\t72: '288px',\r\n\t80: '320px',\r\n\t96: '384px',\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMost Tailwind users need to change nothing if this change goes live. Those developers who have actually affected website needs to change their Tailwind config to have the rem spacing values.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nEven if we assume that for some reason an unreasonable amount of websites need their interface to zoom when a user has changed the default font-size, this change would still be a positive change because the default should be what's best in most cases, not what can be useful in some weird edge cases especially when it takes about ~1 minute to change the pixel values to rem for a developer in their own config file.\r\n\r\n**Important**: This change would not affect font-sizes and some few other properties like max-w-md, which would still use rem units. This change would only affect the spacing properties like margin and some other properties like border-width.\r\n\r\nSorry if this was a bit aggressive, I'm just really frustrated that I needed to make this issue at all.</div>","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13108","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Spacing utilities to px instead of rem by default\" (#13108)"},{"Id":"2171821307","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-06T16:20:07","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"13106","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] Prep v4 `4.0.0-alpha.3` version","State":"closed","Body":"Requires:\r\n\r\n- #13103\r\n- #13105 \r\n- #13107","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/13106","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[v4] Prep v4 `4.0.0-alpha.3` version\" (#13106)"},{"Id":"2171836648","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-06T15:57:23","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"13107","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] Drop deprecated `decoration-slice` and `decoration-clone` utilities","State":"closed","Body":"This PR removes deprecated `decoration-slice` and `decoration-clone` utilities.\n<!--\n\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

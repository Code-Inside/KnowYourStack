In case you want to run a full build again (e.g.: when a CSS file changed), then you can call the `compile` function again.\n\nAll potential caches are scoped to the `compile` function, which means that if you call `compile` again, you will get a fresh instance (and the old caches can be garbage collected).\n\nThis PR also introduces more dedicated methods on the internal `DesignSystem` for parsing candidates, parsing variants and compiling AST nodes from candidates.\n\nAll these methods are behind caches, so we don't do unnecessary work and re-use everything as much as possible. All objects will use the same instance which means that we can compare them by reference when needed.\n\nThis also includes optimizations for incremental rebuilds, such as:\n\n- Don't even try to handle known invalid candidates.\n- Skip re-printing the AST to CSS when the generated AST is the same as the previous one.\n- Skip work if no new candidates are detected.\n\n\n<!--\n\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

For example in the tailwindcss.com codebase, this reduces incremental build times from 40ms to 30ms.\n\nIn the CLI build, the following flags are available:\n\n- `--minify` — this will optimize the CSS output and minify it.\n- `--optimize` — this will optimize the CSS output but **not** minify it.\n\nIn the Vite plugin, the Lightning CSS optimizations are only enabled for production builds.\n\nIn the PostCSS plugin, we added a new option `optimize` that can be used to enable the optimizations.\n\n```ts\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: {\n    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {\n      // This will optimize and minify the CSS output.\n      optimize: true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```ts\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: {\n    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {\n      optimize: {\n        // This will optimize but not minify the CSS output.\n        minify: false\n      } \n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<!--\n\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

Upgrading to v4 was seamless for this, we were able to build and publish the design system.\r\n\r\nWhen using the design system in the monorepo in a Next.js project we're transpiling the components (rather than using the built version).\r\n\r\nI noticed that the styles were not being generated, I assumed this was because the automatic detection was not picking it up. Looking at the config code, it seems like we should be passing through the `base` as the config variable based on the config:\r\n```\r\ntype PluginOptions = {\r\n  // The base directory to scan for class candidates.\r\n  base?: string\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt first I tried putting in `\"../..\"` so that it would map to a relative root directory, but it seems like the only way to use base is with an absolute path eg `\"/Users/me/Code/monorepo/\" which does work.\r\n\r\nIt would just be nice to be able to use a relative directory here so that when we look at deploying/cloning the repo it's not hard coded to a user directory.\r\n\r\nI imagine this might be solved when:\r\n> We’ll introduce a way to configure content paths explicitly in the future for sure, but we’re curious to see how well this automatic approach works for everyone — it’s working awesome in our own projects.\r\n\r\nSo feel free to also close this and I can be patient 😅 ","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13136","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"v4: Automatic content detection in monorepos only finds direct package\" (#13136)"},{"Id":"2174708718","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-07T20:16:29","Actor":"jcbhmr","Number":"13133","RawContent":null,"Title":"v4 alpha does not work on Stackblitz","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

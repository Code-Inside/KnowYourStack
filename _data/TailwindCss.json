TypeScript incorrectly marked as JavaScript\r\n**File:** `standalone.test.ts` (Line 125)\r\n\r\n**Problem:**  \r\nA snippet referencing `src/plugin.ts` used the `js` template tag even though the content included TypeScript syntax (`export interface PluginOptions {}`).  \r\nThis caused `prettier-plugin-embed` to attempt parsing TypeScript as JavaScript and fail.\r\n\r\n**Fix:**\r\n- Replaced `js` → `ts` template tag  \r\n- Added `ts` to imports from `../utils`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### 2. Invalid CSS parsed as actual CSS\r\n**File:** `index.test.ts` (Lines 2595–2599)\r\n\r\n**Problem:**  \r\nThe test intentionally contains invalid CSS (`*/` without an opening `/*`).  \r\nIt was tagged with the `css` template tag, causing Prettier to try formatting it and crash.\r\n\r\n**Fix:**\r\n- Replaced `css` → `txt` template tag  \r\n- Added `txt` to imports from `../utils`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Result\r\n-  Prettier lint checks now pass  \r\n-  TypeScript code is formatted correctly  \r\n-  Invalid CSS test no longer breaks formatting  \r\n-  Test suite is more stable and consistent\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/19400","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix invalid template tags in tests\" (#19400)"},{"Id":"3685433535","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-02T12:09:28","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"19399","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update @playwright/test 1.56.1 → 1.57.0 (minor)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

I noted each step in README that was used to create that project and was needed to reproduced that issue\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nChanging tailwind class names in `*.tsx` components does not trigger browser to reload the style file. After changing class names in `tsx` components, html updates but the styling is gone because initially loaded css does not include definition of newly added class. After manual reload style is loading fine.\r\n\r\nI observed that, after each change(for example changing from `bg-red-500` to `bg-blue-500` in component, new class is appended to: ` ./next/static/css/app_globals_css.css` so that means that tailwind is working as supposed to. It seems that there is something with Hot Module Replacement.\r\n\r\nDescribed behaviour exists when env variable is set to TAILWIND_MODE=watch\r\n\r\nI am beginner in javascript, typescript, next and tailwind but I am sure that it shouldn't behave liek that\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce issue \r\n\r\n1. Add color class to `app/page.tsx` for example `bg-red-500`\r\n2. Run app with `npm run dev`\r\n3. Enter `localhost:3000`\r\n4. Change background color class to something different(ex. `bg-red-600`) and save file\r\n5. File `.next/static/css/app_globals_css.css` has updated and added class exists at the end of file\r\n6. Background color on the page disappears because `css` file is not reloaded and new class does not exist in currently loaded file\r\n7. Reload page manually - change should be now visible\r\n8. Change background class again\r\n9. Add anything to `app/globals.css` and save it, still css is not refreshed\r\n\r\nAfter each step in the developer console message `[Fast Refresh] rebuilding` is printed. In the terminal, log below is printed\r\n\r\n```\r\nwait  - compiling...\r\nevent - compiled client and server successfully in 178 ms (332 modules)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Workaround for chrome\r\n\r\n1. Open developer console\r\n2. Go to settings -> workspace\r\n3. Add folder `~/.next/static/css`\r\n4. After that step, all the css changes should be visible immidiately after fast refresh\r\n\r\nVideo that shows following issue\r\n\r\n![reproducing-issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20795446/204384286-0ca448b1-75cd-4a92-80bf-c8e97e48bbfc.gif)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/9954","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Hot module replacement is not picking css changes after editing tailwind class in components\" (#9954)"},{"Id":"1463860755","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-30T13:26:17","Actor":"OpenSnack","Number":"9929","RawContent":null,"Title":"resolveConfig returns wrong TypeScript type for theme keys","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

For example, versions of Deno older than v1.2 don't support the new <code class=\"notranslate\">||=</code> operator, so adding e.g. <code class=\"notranslate\">--target=deno1.0</code> to esbuild now lets you tell esbuild to transpile <code class=\"notranslate\">||=</code> to older JavaScript.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Fix the <code class=\"notranslate\">esbuild-wasm</code> package in Node v19 (<a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2683\">#2683</a>)</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">A recent change to Node v19 added a non-writable <code class=\"notranslate\">crypto</code> property to the global object: <a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44897\">nodejs/node#44897</a>. This conflicts with Go's WebAssembly shim code, which overwrites the global <code class=\"notranslate\">crypto</code> property. As a result, all Go-based WebAssembly code that uses the built-in shim (including esbuild) is now broken on Node v19. This release of esbuild fixes the issue by reconfiguring the global <code class=\"notranslate\">crypto</code> property to be writable before invoking Go's WebAssembly shim code.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Fix CSS dimension printing exponent confusion edge case (<a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2677\">#2677</a>)</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">In CSS, a dimension token has a numeric \"value\" part and an identifier \"unit\" part. For example, the dimension token <code class=\"notranslate\">32px</code> has a value of <code class=\"notranslate\">32</code> and a unit of <code class=\"notranslate\">px</code>. The unit can be any valid CSS identifier. The value can be any number in floating-point format including an optional exponent (e.g. <code class=\"notranslate\">-3.14e-0</code> has an exponent of <code class=\"notranslate\">e-0</code>). The full details of this syntax are here: <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/\">https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">To maintain the integrity of the dimension token through the printing process, esbuild must handle the edge case where the unit looks like an exponent. One such case is the dimension <code class=\"notranslate\">1e\\32</code> which has the value <code class=\"notranslate\">1</code> and the unit <code class=\"notranslate\">e2</code>. It would be bad if this dimension token was printed such that a CSS parser would parse it as a number token with the value <code class=\"notranslate\">1e2</code> instead of a dimension token. The way esbuild currently does this is to escape the leading <code class=\"notranslate\">e</code> in the dimension unit, so esbuild would parse <code class=\"notranslate\">1e\\32</code> but print <code class=\"notranslate\">1\\65 2</code> (both <code class=\"notranslate\">1e\\32</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">1\\65 2</code> represent a dimension token with a value of <code class=\"notranslate\">1</code> and a unit of <code class=\"notranslate\">e2</code>).</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">However, there is an even narrower edge case regarding this edge case. If the value part of the dimension token itself has an <code class=\"notranslate\">e</code>, then it's not necessary to escape the <code class=\"notranslate\">e</code> in the dimension unit because a CSS parser won't confuse the unit with the exponent even though it looks like one (since a number can only have at most one exponent). This came up because the grammar for the CSS <code class=\"notranslate\">unicode-range</code> property uses a hack that lets you specify a hexadecimal range without quotes even though CSS has no token for a hexadecimal range. The hack is to allow the hexadecimal range to be parsed as a dimension token and optionally also a number token. Here is the grammar for <code class=\"notranslate\">unicode-range</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"notranslate\"><code class=\"notranslate\">unicode-range =\n  &lt;urange&gt;#\n\n&lt;urange&gt; =\n  u '+' &lt;ident-token&gt; '?'*            |\n  u &lt;dimension-token&gt; '?'*            |\n  u &lt;number-token&gt; '?'*               |\n  u &lt;number-token&gt; &lt;dimension-token&gt;  |\n  u &lt;number-token&gt; &lt;number-token&gt;     |\n  u '+' '?'+\n</code></pre>\n<p dir=\"auto\">and here is an example <code class=\"notranslate\">unicode-range</code> declaration that was problematic for esbuild:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight highlight-source-css\" dir=\"auto\"><pre><span class=\"pl-k\">@font-face</span> {\n  <span class=\"pl-c1\">unicode-range</span><span class=\"pl-kos\">:</span> U+0e2e-0e2f;\n}</pre></div>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This is parsed as a dimension with a value of <code class=\"notranslate\">+0e2</code> and a unit of <code class=\"notranslate\">e-0e2f</code>. This was problematic for esbuild because the unit starts with <code class=\"notranslate\">e-0</code> which could be confused with an exponent when appended after a number, so esbuild was escaping the <code class=\"notranslate\">e</code> character in the unit. However, this escaping is unnecessary because in this case the dimension value already has an exponent in it. With this release, esbuild will no longer unnecessarily escape the <code class=\"notranslate\">e</code> in the dimension unit in these cases, which should fix the printing of <code class=\"notranslate\">unicode-range</code> declarations.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">An aside: You may be wondering why esbuild is trying to escape the <code class=\"notranslate\">e</code> at all and why it doesn't just pass through the original source code unmodified. The reason why esbuild does this is that, for robustness, esbuild's AST generally tries to omit semantically-unrelated information and esbuild's code printers always try to preserve the semantics of the underlying AST. That way the rest of esbuild's internals can just deal with semantics instead of presentation. They don't have to think about how the AST will be printed when changing the AST. This is the same reason that esbuild's JavaScript AST doesn't have a \"parentheses\" node (e.g. <code class=\"notranslate\">a * (b + c)</code> is represented by the AST <code class=\"notranslate\">multiply(a, add(b, c))</code> instead of <code class=\"notranslate\">multiply(a, parentheses(add(b, c)))</code>). Instead, the printer automatically inserts parentheses as necessary to maintain the semantics of the AST, which means all of the optimizations that run over the AST don't have to worry about keeping the parentheses up to date. Similarly, the CSS AST for the dimension token stores the actual unit and the printer makes sure the unit is properly escaped depending on what value it's placed after. All of the other code operating on CSS ASTs doesn't have to worry about parsing escapes to compare units or about keeping escapes up to date when the AST is modified. Hopefully that makes sense.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Attempt to avoid creating the <code class=\"notranslate\">node_modules/.cache</code> directory for people that use Yarn 2+ in Plug'n'Play mode (<a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2685\">#2685</a>)</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">When Yarn's PnP mode is enabled, packages installed by Yarn may or may not be put inside <code class=\"notranslate\">.zip</code> files. The specific heuristics for when this happens change over time in between Yarn versions. This is problematic for esbuild because esbuild's JavaScript package needs to execute a binary file inside the package. Yarn makes extensive modifications to Node's file system APIs at run time to pretend that <code class=\"notranslate\">.zip</code> files are normal directories and to make it hard to tell whether a file is real or not (since in theory it doesn't matter). But they haven't modified Node's <code class=\"notranslate\">child_process.execFileSync</code> API so attempting to execute a file inside a zip file fails. To get around this, esbuild previously used Node's file system APIs to copy the binary executable to another location before invoking <code class=\"notranslate\">execFileSync</code>. Under the hood this caused Yarn to extract the file from the zip file into a real file that can then be run.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">However, esbuild copied its executable into <code class=\"notranslate\">node_modules/.cache/esbuild</code>. This is the <a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/advanced/rulebook/#packages-should-never-write-inside-their-own-folder-outside-of-postinstall\">official recommendation from the Yarn team</a> for where packages are supposed to put these types of files when Yarn PnP is being used. However, users of Yarn PnP with esbuild find this really annoying because they don't like looking at the <code class=\"notranslate\">node_modules</code> directory. With this release, esbuild now sets <code class=\"notranslate\">\"preferUnplugged\": true</code> in its <code class=\"notranslate\">package.json</code> files, which tells newer versions of Yarn to not put esbuild's packages in a zip file. There may exist older versions of Yarn that don't support <code class=\"notranslate\">preferUnplugged</code>. In that case esbuild should still copy the executable to a cache directory, so it should still run (hopefully, since I haven't tested this myself). Note that esbuild setting <code class=\"notranslate\">\"preferUnplugged\": true</code> may have the side effect of esbuild taking up more space on the file system in the event that multiple platforms are installed simultaneously, or that you're using an older version of Yarn that always installs packages for all platforms. In that case you may want to update to a newer version of Yarn since Yarn has recently changed to only install packages for the current platform.</p>\n</li>\n</ul></blockquote>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/releases/tag/v0.15.14\">0.15.14</a></h4>\n\n<blockquote><ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Fix parsing of TypeScript <code class=\"notranslate\">infer</code> inside a conditional <code class=\"notranslate\">extends</code> (<a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2675\">#2675</a>)</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Unlike JavaScript, parsing TypeScript sometimes requires backtracking. The <code class=\"notranslate\">infer A</code> type operator can take an optional constraint of the form <code class=\"notranslate\">infer A extends B</code>. However, this syntax conflicts with the similar conditional type operator <code class=\"notranslate\">A extends B ? C : D</code> in cases where the syntax is combined, such as <code class=\"notranslate\">infer A extends B ? C : D</code>. This is supposed to be parsed as <code class=\"notranslate\">(infer A) extends B ? C : D</code>. Previously esbuild incorrectly parsed this as <code class=\"notranslate\">(infer A extends B) ? C : D</code> instead, which is a parse error since the <code class=\"notranslate\">?:</code> conditional operator requires the <code class=\"notranslate\">extends</code> keyword as part of the conditional type. TypeScript disambiguates by speculatively parsing the <code class=\"notranslate\">extends</code> after the <code class=\"notranslate\">infer</code>, but backtracking if a <code class=\"notranslate\">?</code> token is encountered afterward. With this release, esbuild should now do the same thing, so esbuild should now correctly parse these types.

This caused esbuild's watch mode subsystem to add a dependency on the full list of entries in that directory since if that changes, the generated log message would also have to be updated. However, meant that on systems where a parent directory undergoes constant directory entry churn, esbuild's watch mode would continue to rebuild if <code class=\"notranslate\">--log-level=debug</code> was passed.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">With this release, these debug log messages are now generated by \"peeking\" at the file system state while bypassing esbuild's watch mode dependency tracking. So now watch mode doesn't consider the count of directory entries in these debug log messages to be a part of the build that needs to be kept up to date when the file system state changes.</p>\n</li>\n</ul></blockquote>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/releases/tag/v0.15.13\">0.15.13</a></h4>\n\n<blockquote><ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Add support for the TypeScript 4.9 <code class=\"notranslate\">satisfies</code> operator (<a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/2509\">#2509</a>)</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">TypeScript 4.9 introduces a new operator called <code class=\"notranslate\">satisfies</code> that lets you check that a given value satisfies a less specific type without casting it to that less specific type and without generating any additional code at run-time.

To handle cases like this, the path resolution layer in esbuild has a hack where it treats inaccessible directories as empty. However, esbuild's watch implementation currently triggers a rebuild if a directory previously encountered an error but the directory now exists. The assumption is that the previous error was caused by the directory not existing. Although that's usually the case, it's not the case for this particular parent directory on Android. Instead the error is that the directory previously existed but was inaccessible.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">This discrepancy between esbuild's path resolution layer and its watch mode was causing watch mode to rebuild continuously on Android. With this release, esbuild's watch mode instead checks for an error status change in the <code class=\"notranslate\">readdir</code> file system call, so watch mode should no longer rebuild continuously on Android.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p dir=\"auto\">Apply a fix for a rare deadlock with the JavaScript API (<a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/1842\">#1842</a>, <a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/2485\">#2485</a>)</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">There have been reports of esbuild sometimes exiting with an \"all goroutines are asleep\" deadlock message from the Go language runtime. This issue hasn't made much progress until recently, where a possible cause was discovered (thanks to <a href=\"https://bounce.depfu.com/github.com/jfirebaugh\">@jfirebaugh</a> for the investigation). This release contains a possible fix for that possible cause, so this deadlock may have been fixed. The fix cannot be easily verified because the deadlock is non-deterministic and rare. If this was indeed the cause, then this issue only affected the JavaScript API in situations where esbuild was already in the process of exiting.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">In detail: The underlying cause is that Go's <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/sync#WaitGroup\"><code class=\"notranslate\">sync.WaitGroup</code></a> API for waiting for a set of goroutines to finish is not fully thread-safe. Specifically it's not safe to call <code class=\"notranslate\">Add()</code> concurrently with <code class=\"notranslate\">Wait()</code> when the wait group counter is zero due to a data race. This situation could come up with esbuild's JavaScript API when the host JavaScript process closes the child process's stdin and the child process (with no active tasks) calls <code class=\"notranslate\">Wait()</code> to check that there are no active tasks, at the same time as esbuild's watchdog timer calls <code class=\"notranslate\">Add()</code> to add an active task (that pings the host to see if it's still there). The fix in this release is to avoid calling <code class=\"notranslate\">Add()</code> once we learn that stdin has been closed but before we call <code class=\"notranslate\">Wait()</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul></blockquote>\n<p><em>Does any of this look wrong? <a href=\"https://depfu.com/packages/npm/esbuild/feedback\">Please let us know.</a></em></p>\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/compare/223e6eaa90c699d052737bd574c25dab7adca212...478062d5310b27f1a6a259602a79bf84e233cc1d\">See the full diff on Github</a>.

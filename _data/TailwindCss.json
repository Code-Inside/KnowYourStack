However, these binaries are 0-byte placeholder files that fail to execute.\n\nWhen running `bun run <script>`, Bun prepends `node_modules/.bin` to PATH, so it finds the broken npm-installed `bun` binary instead of the global Bun installation. This causes all scripts to silently fail with exit code 1.\n\n**Expected behavior:** Scripts defined in package.json should work with `bun run dev`.\n\n**Workaround:** Add override to package.json to prevent the `bun` npm package from being installed:\n\n```json\n\"overrides\": {\n  \"bun\": \"link:.\"\n}\n```\n\n**Suggested fix:** Remove `bun` from peerDependencies. Since this plugin only works within the Bun runtime, requiring `bun` as a peer dependency is unnecessary — Bun is always present when using this package.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/19471","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"bun-plugin-tailwind: peerDependency on \"bun\" causes broken npm bun package to shadow global Bun installation, breaking all scripts\" (#19471)"},{"Id":"3748697007","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-19T21:20:03","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"19468","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update all of nextjs 16.0.10 → 16.1.0 (minor)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

However, lowercase-only parent keys (e.g., `iosv3`, `glass`, `electric`) work correctly.\n\nThis behavior is **undocumented** and creates confusion during migration from v3 to v4, as mixed-case keys worked fine in v3.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n### 1. Configuration Setup\n\n**globals.css:**\n\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n@config \"./tailwind.config.ts\";\n```\n\n**tailwind.config.ts:**\n\n```typescript\nimport type { Config } from \"tailwindcss\";\n\nconst config: Config = {\n  content: [\"./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}\"],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      colors: {\n        // ❌ This DOESN'T generate utilities\n        iosV3: {\n          \"glass-700\": \"rgba(26, 26, 27, 1)\",\n          \"glass-800\": \"rgba(17, 17, 18, 1)\",\n          \"electric-400\": \"rgba(34, 80, 225, 1)\",\n        },\n\n        // ✅ This DOES generate utilities\n        glass: {\n          700: \"rgba(31, 31, 31, 1)\",\n          800: \"rgba(17, 17, 18, 1)\",\n        },\n\n        // ✅ This DOES generate utilities\n        electric: {\n          400: \"rgb(33, 55, 252)\",\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n};\n\nexport default config;\n```\n\n### 2. Component Usage\n\n```tsx\n// Try to use the colors\n<div className=\"bg-iosV3-glass-700\">     {/* ❌ No style applied */}\n  This has no background\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"bg-glass-700\">           {/* ✅ Works correctly */}\n  This has background\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"bg-electric-400\">        {/* ✅ Works correctly */}\n  This has background\n</div>\n```\n\n### 3. Build and Inspect\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n# Check generated CSS - iosV3 utilities are missing\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n**All nested color objects should generate utilities**, regardless of parent key casing:\n\n- `bg-iosV3-glass-700` should be generated from `iosV3: { 'glass-700': '...' }`\n- `text-myTheme-primary` should be generated from `myTheme: { 'primary': '...' }`\n- Or at minimum, provide a **clear warning/error** during build\n\nThis behavior worked in Tailwind CSS v3.\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\n- ✅ `glass: { 700: '...' }` → Generates `bg-glass-700`\n- ✅ `electric: { 400: '...' }` → Generates `bg-electric-400`\n- ❌ `iosV3: { 'glass-700': '...' }` → **No utilities generated** (silent failure)\n- ✅ `iosv3: { 'glass-700': '...' }` → Generates `bg-iosv3-glass-700` (lowercase works!)\n\n## Workaround\n\nRename all mixed-case parent keys to lowercase:\n\n```typescript\n// Before (doesn't work)\ncolors: {\n  iosV3: { 'glass-700': '...' }\n}\n\n// After (works)\ncolors: {\n  iosv3: { 'glass-700': '...' }\n}\n```\n\nThen update all component usages:\n\n```tsx\n// Before\n<div className=\"bg-iosV3-glass-700\">\n\n// After\n<div className=\"bg-iosv3-glass-700\">\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nThis issue:\n\n1. **Breaks existing codebases** migrating from v3 to v4 with mixed-case color keys\n2. **Fails silently** - no errors or warnings, styles just don't apply\n3. **Is undocumented** - not mentioned in the v4 upgrade guide or documentation\n4. **Creates debugging confusion** - developers see classes in HTML but no styles applied\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n### Option 1: Support mixed-case keys (preferred)\n\nMake Tailwind v4 handle mixed-case parent keys the same way it handles lowercase keys.\n\n### Option 2: Document the limitation\n\nAdd clear documentation to the v4 upgrade guide explaining:\n\n- Mixed-case parent keys are not supported\n- Use lowercase-only parent keys for nested color objects\n- Provide migration instructions\n\n### Option 3: Show warnings\n\nDisplay a build-time warning when detecting mixed-case parent keys:\n\n```\n⚠ Warning: Color key 'iosV3' contains mixed-case characters.\nTailwind v4 only generates utilities for lowercase parent keys.\nConsider renaming to 'iosv3' for utilities to be generated.\n```\n\n## Additional Context\n\nWe discovered this while upgrading a large production codebase. The issue affected:\n\n- 43 component files\n- Multiple color utilities (bg-, text-, border-, fill-, from-, etc.)\n- Required bulk renaming across the entire codebase\n\nThe discovery process took significant debugging time because:\n\n1. No errors were shown\n2. HTML contained the correct class names\n3. CSS just didn't include the utilities\n4.

Went for the \"hacky\" approach with the non-native `tw-color-mix()` function for now, as this approach is much more straight-forward in the CSS parsing and AST functions.\r\n\r\n## Test plan & other Notes\r\n\r\n- Added a (first-failing) test \"does not apply optimizations to native color-mix()\"\r\n- Updated all tests that were failing\r\n- Apply the alpha in the `:placeholder` rule in preflight manually, to keep the css valid case that file would be loaded without directly from somewhere\r\n\r\n## Breaking Change\r\n\r\nWhat speaks against this: It would be a breaking change.

However, functional responsive variants like `max-sm:` and `min-md:` fall back to Tailwind's built-in defaults instead of using my custom values.\n\n**Example:**\n\n```css\n@theme static {\n  --breakpoint-sm: 640px;\n  --breakpoint-md: 768px;\n}\n```\n\nIn markup:\n```\n<div class=\"sm: p-2 max-sm: p-3 min-md: p-4\">Test</div>\n```\n\n**Generates:**\n- `sm:p-2` → `@media (min-width: 640px)` (correct)\n- `max-sm:p-3` → `@media (max-width: 639px)` (fallbacks to Tailwind default 639px, not the static value)\n- `min-md:p-4` → `@media (min-width: 768px)` (fallbacks to Tailwind default 768px, not the static value)\n\nUnprefixed breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, etc.) work as expected, but dynamic variants `max-*` and `min-*` ignore the custom definitions when using `@theme static`. If you use `@theme` or `@theme default`, this problem disappears, but using `static` is required for my scenario (for Nuxt UI or integration constraints).\n\n**Why this matters**\n- Projects using Tailwind CSS v4+ with custom breakpoint management in CSS need all responsive variants to respect user-defined breakpoints regardless of theme block type.\n- Duplicating breakpoints between `@theme static` and non-static theme blocks is not a sustainable workaround.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**\n1. Use `@theme static` to define custom breakpoints (e.g., `--breakpoint-sm: 640px;`)\n2. Add classes such as `sm:p-2`, `max-sm:p-3`, and `min-md:p-4` in your markup\n3. Build and inspect the generated CSS and see that max/min prefixed variants use default values\n\n**Expected:** All responsive variants use my custom breakpoints, regardless of theme block method.\n\n**Actual:** Only unprefixed variants do; `max-*` and `min-*` do not support custom statically-defined breakpoints. \n\nSee also: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/23347\n\n/cc @ivan-angjelkoski\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/19446","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Dynamic responsive variants (max-*/min-*) do not honor custom breakpoints defined in @theme static, while unprefixed variants do\" (#19446)"},{"Id":"3730313369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-12-15T13:11:18","Actor":"KingHorse2015","Number":"19444","RawContent":null,"Title":"Memory Leak when trying to build or run dev with Vite","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\n4.1.18\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nLaravel 12.42 - Vite 7.3\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nV20 LTS (Also tried V24 LTS, V25)\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nChrome / Edge\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nWindows 11 25H2\n\nVite Config\n```\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite';\nimport laravel from 'laravel-vite-plugin';\nimport tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n    plugins: [\n        laravel({\n            input: ['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'],\n            refresh: [\n                'resources/views/**',\n                'routes/**',\n                'app/**',\n            ],\n        }),\n        tailwindcss(),\n    ],\n    server: {\n        watch: {\n            ignored: [\n                '**/database/**',\n                '**/storage/**',\n                '**/vendor/**',\n            ],\n        },\n    },\n    logLevel: 'info',\n});\n```\n\n\nApp.css\n```\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n\n@source '../../vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Pagination/resources/views/*.blade.php';\n@source '../../storage/framework/views/*.php';\n@source '../**/*.blade.php';\n@source '../**/*.js';\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/19444","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Memory Leak when trying to build or run dev with Vite\" (#19444)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-12-25T03:30:25.5849063Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":509}

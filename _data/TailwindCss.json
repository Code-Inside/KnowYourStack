Additionally, there are instances where the rebuilding process fails, especially under heavy loads or when dealing with an extensive set of classes.

This leads to styling not being applied for max breakpoints, and no way for the dev to know unless it's visually noticeable in the browser.\r\n\r\nAs I had trouble figuring out where the max-* classes were defined while trying to identify the bug, once I remembered that they were auto-generated (tucked away in the docs [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#targeting-a-breakpoint-range)), I just explicitly defined these in the config as well. It's easier, then, to trace for any other devs unfamiliar with TW.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  sm: '400px',\r\n  md: '612px',\r\n  lg: '768px',\r\n  xl: '1024px',\r\n\r\n  'max-sm': { max: '399px'},\r\n  'max-md':  { max: '611px'},\r\n  'max-lg':  { max: '767px'},\r\n  'max-xl':  { max: '1023px'},\r\n\r\n  // This now has no impact on the max-* classes as we define them above\r\n  'has-hover': { raw: '(hover: hover)' },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this the expected behaviour? Should there be more notice when the max-* classes aren't successfully generated? Should docs surrounding the max-* classes be easier to find, or added to the screens section? Quick search is no help, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nThanks!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13022","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Adding non-pixel media queries to screens config prevents auto-generated max-* classes for the rest of the breakpoints\" (#13022)"},{"Id":"2152388269","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-24T22:47:57","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"13020","RawContent":null,"Title":"🚨 [security] Update vite 4.3.2 → 5.1.4 (major)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n<hr>\n\n🚨 <b>Your current dependencies have known security vulnerabilities</b> 🚨\n\nThis dependency update fixes known security vulnerabilities.

Are `container` or `grid` something special to the framework? \r\nIf that functionality does not work - why you even suggesting it.\r\n**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\nFor example: https://cdn.tailwindcss.com/3.4.1\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\nFor example: Play CDN\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\nFor example: v20\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\n\r\nFor example: Chrome\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\n\r\nFor example: macOS\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\n\r\nA Tailwind Play link or public GitHub repo that includes a minimal reproduction of the bug. **Please do not link to your actual project**, what we need instead is a _minimal_ reproduction in a fresh project without any unnecessary code. This means it doesn't matter if your real project is private/confidential, since we want a link to a separate, isolated reproduction anyways.\r\n\r\nA reproduction is **required** when filing an issue — any issue opened without a reproduction will be closed and you'll be asked to create a new issue that includes a reproduction. We're a small team and we can't keep up with the volume of issues we receive if we need to reproduce each issue from scratch ourselves.\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nDescribe the problem you're seeing, any important steps to reproduce and what behavior you expect instead.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/12935","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Play CDN does not work as expected\" (#12935)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2024-02-29T03:30:22.1338149Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":441}

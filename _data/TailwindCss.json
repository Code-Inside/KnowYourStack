The example provided is not functioning as expected. To demonstrate the problem, I have attached a video showcasing the issue.\r\n\r\n## Environment:\r\n\r\nBrowser: Brave Browser (version: [Please specify version])\r\nTailwind CSS version: v3.3.2\r\n\r\n## Steps to Reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the documentation page containing the example for sticky positioning.\r\n2. Observe that the sticky positioning element does not behave correctly.\r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior:\r\n\r\nThe sticky positioning element should stick to the specified position on the page as the user scrolls.\r\n\r\n## Actual Behavior:\r\nThe sticky positioning element does not stick to the specified position and behaves incorrectly when scrolling.\r\n\r\n## Attached Files:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/109217591/27b0b64f-2e2a-49ce-9da9-18902c0babe5","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/11509","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[Bug]: Example of Sticky Positioning Element Not Working in Tailwind Docs\" (#11509)"},{"Id":"1779633119","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-29T13:49:54","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"11504","RawContent":null,"Title":"Sort classes using position of first matching rule","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss/issues/174\r\n\r\nGiven a list of components like this:\r\n```js\r\naddComponents({\r\n  '.foo': { display: 'block' },\r\n  '.foo-1': { display: 'block' },\r\n  '.bar': { display: 'block' },\r\n\r\n  // This rule matches both the utility `foo` and `bar`\r\n  // But when sorting `foo` — we've already got a\r\n  // position for `foo` so we should use it\r\n  '.bar .foo': { display: 'block' },\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the last rule matches both the utilities `foo` and `bar`.\r\n\r\nWhen sorting lists of classes we would iterate over all generated rules. Given that last rule matches both `foo` and `bar` it would win for any instance of `foo` used. This means that the utility `foo` would have a much \"later\" position than expected. For example, `foo-1 foo` would be sorted and stay as-is instead of becoming the expected `foo foo-1`.\r\n\r\nNow, given that we cache rules, the internal utility we used to match against them could be overwritten. As such, once you used `bar` the utility was permanently changed and no longer matched the utility `foo` causing the sort order to change for any list of classes _after_ the one that used the utility `bar`.\r\n\r\nAll that to say, given this HTML:\r\n\r\nWe would see the following HTML file as having sorted classes:\r\n```html\r\n<span class=\"foo-1 foo\"></span>\r\n<span class=\"bar\"></span>\r\n<span class=\"foo foo-2\"></span>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen in reality it should be this:\r\n```html\r\n<span class=\"foo foo-1\"></span>\r\n<span class=\"bar\"></span>\r\n<span class=\"foo foo-2\"></span>\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/11504","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Sort classes using position of first matching rule\" (#11504)"},{"Id":"1780651342","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-29T13:46:21","Actor":"wqcstrong","Number":"11507","RawContent":null,"Title":"less don't support arbitrary value about shadow","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

We build up a one or more selectors that are used to \"modify\" the resulting utility selector in your CSS. After we've build up the final list of \"changes\" to a given utility, taking into account all it's variants, we then add prefixes to all classes in the selector (for example, `group` becomes `tw-group`, `dark` becomes `tw-dark`, `underline` becomes `tw-underline`, etc…). The problem with this approach is, at this point, there's no information about what data was derived from arbitrary values and thus no mechanism by which we can say \"prefix class `.a` but not `.b`\" or \"prefix `.a` but not in this one instance\".\r\n\r\nHow is it that we don't know? After all, aren't we matching against the utility?\r\n\r\nTake for example this very simplified version of the group variant:\r\n```js\r\nmatchVariant(\"group\", (value) => `.group${value} &`)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen matching the utility `group-[.bar]:flex` and building its rule we then process the `foo` variant and generate a selector. We place the value `.bar` in for the `value` parameter and the function returns `.group.bar &`.\r\n\r\nThis is almost as if we had written this:\r\n```js\r\naddVariant(\"group-[.bar]\", `.group.bar &`)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll notice here there are no prefixes present yet — this is because, in general, this is handled later in the pipeline for variants.\r\n\r\nNow, we explicitly call `prefix` function for the `group` class _and_ disable prefixing later in the pipeline _for this variant only_. This effectively treats the variant as if it were defined like so:\r\n\r\n```js\r\naddVariant(\"group-[.bar]\", `.tw-group.bar &`, { respectPrefix: false })\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn which case no prefixing is done after building the variant selector because it includes prefixes already.\r\n\r\nNow, given that existing user plugins may be defining variants AND those variants have their classes prefixed we can't just disable it wholesale and expect it to be handled in the variant. Additionally, since there's no information about what data was derived from arbitrary values (AND don't even have to be selectors!), to preserve backwards compat while also fixing this we've updated the `group` and `peer` variants specifically such that:\r\n\r\n1. The relevant `group`, `peer`, `group/name-here`, `peer/name-here`, etc… classes are prefixed _inside_ the variant function that generates the selector.\r\n2. Exposed an internal-for-now flag for variants called `respectPrefix` — much like the `respectPrefix` flag present in `addUtilities`, `matchUtilities`, `addComponents`, etc…\r\n3. Used this flag such that the auto-prefixing that happens later in the pipeline is _disabled_ for this specific variant (like we already do for arbitrary variants — it is infact using the same code path in the end)\r\n\r\nThis flag is left as internal for now as we want to be sure of the API before we expose it to user-land, work on documentation, etc…\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/11454","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Don't prefix arbitrary classes in `peer`/`group` variants\" (#11454)"},{"Id":"1778168021","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-28T07:42:29","Actor":"zellwk","Number":"11500","RawContent":null,"Title":"Preset file gets picked up, but is not working","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\n3.3.2\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\n Astro's Tailwind integration\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\nTested with v18 and v20. \r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\n\r\nNA.

I've spent about 2 hours on it now, and continue to find situations where it breaks my expectations of tailwind's behaviour. Got to stop now. I'm relatively confident though that this does not work as expected, as I would expect the `main.css` to be watched under any circumstances. I'd suspect the bug to be somewhere around [here](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/eae2b7a3f4f3a2981614a580a9f5534b9ffe0586/src/cli/build/watching.js#L223-L227), but not sure. TS is not my first language, and I'm also not usually involved with tailwind / CSS much.\r\n\r\nLet me emphasize though, that this **bug is present in freshly generated Phoenix v1.7.5 projects**, i.e. changes to `app.css` do not cause the watcher to trigger. Maybe of importance, as I think you're friends with the Phoenix people.\r\n\r\nHope this report helps regardless of its non-descriptiveness,\r\nmalte","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/11469","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Watching inputs does not function properly\" (#11469)"},{"Id":"1775496135","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-27T21:11:58","Actor":"god-of-javascript","Number":"11496","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ensure CI jobs don't run for longer than 15 minutes","State":"closed","Body":"This prevents long unwanted gh action runs!\r\n\r\n<img width=\"274\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-06-26 at 21 56 23\" src=\"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/124286495/df32d5f8-a4eb-41fe-9d4f-61a4b4d5d52c\">\r\n\r\nThis one is still running:\r\nhttps://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/actions/runs/5374805685/jobs/9750589528\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

I am using Nuxt 2 with the latest TailwindCSS (3.3.2) being installed as a plugin.\r\n\r\nThis is how my nuxt.config.js looks like:\r\n\r\n`css: ['~/assets/css/tailwind.css']`\r\n\r\n  `build: {\r\n    postcss: {\r\n      plugins: [\r\n        'tailwindcss',\r\n        'postcss-flexbugs-fixes',\r\n        [\r\n          'postcss-preset-env',\r\n          {\r\n            autoprefixer: {\r\n              flexbox: 'no-2009',\r\n            },\r\n            stage: 3,\r\n            features: {\r\n              'custom-properties': false,\r\n            },\r\n          },\r\n        ],\r\n      ],\r\n    }\r\n  }`\r\n\r\n  tailwind.config.js:\r\n`/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */`\r\n\r\n`module.exports = {\r\n    content: [\r\n      './components/**/*.{vue,js}',\r\n      './layouts/**/*.vue',\r\n      './pages/**/*.vue',\r\n      './plugins/**/*.{js,ts}',\r\n      './nuxt.config.{js,ts}',\r\n      './assets/**/*.{vue,js}',\r\n      './assets/css/*.css'\r\n    ],\r\n  safelist: ['text-gradient-warm', 'btn-gradient', 'btn-gradient:hover', 'bg-gradient-to-r', 'from-[#44BCFF]', 'via-[#FF44EC]', 'to-[#FF675E]'],\r\n  theme: {\r\n    extend: {\r\n      colors: {\r\n        'blue-custom': '#44BCFF',\r\n        'pink-custom': '#FF44EC',\r\n        'orange-custom': '#FF675E'\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n  plugins: [\r\n    require('daisyui'),\r\n  ],\r\n  daisyui: {\r\n    styled: true,\r\n    themes: [\"light\"],\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n`\r\n\r\nI have tried so many things but it just does not seem to work. I have also tried all solutions for similar problems I have found online but does not seem to be doing anything. Most text-gradients do not work, and most importantly, some gradient backgrounds on button do not work. For example:\r\n\r\n`<div class=\"absolute transition-all duration-1000 opacity-60 -inset-px bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-custom via-pink-custom to-orange-custom rounded-xl blur-lg group-hover:opacity-80 group-hover:-inset-1 group-hover:duration-200 animate-tilt\"></div>\r\n`\r\n\r\nShows a nice gradient shadow underneath my button but it shows nothing once deployed on Vercel.\r\n\r\nWould really appreciate any help on this as I have been stuck on it for days!\r\n\r\n</div>","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/11487","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"TailwindCSS custom classes not working on Vercel\" (#11487)"},{"Id":"1769793956","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-23T19:49:09","Actor":"peterhirn","Number":"11473","RawContent":null,"Title":"Deduplication swallows variable when name and value are identical (custom PostCSS plugin)","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

I've spent about 2 hours on it now, and continue to find situations where it breaks my expectations of tailwind's behaviour. Got to stop now. I'm relatively confident though that this does not work as expected, as I would expect the main.css to be watched under any circumstances.

TS is not my first language, and I'm also not usually involved with tailwind / CSS much.\r\n\r\nLet me emphasize though, that this bug is present in freshly generated Phoenix v1.7.5 projects, i.e. changes to app.css do not cause the watcher to trigger. Maybe of importance, as I think you're friends with the Phoenix people.\r\n\r\nHope this report helps regardless of its non-descriptiveness,\r\nmalte","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/11484","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Watching inputs does not function properly\" (#11484)"},{"Id":"1770328769","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-22T20:41:37","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"11476","RawContent":null,"Title":"Always prepend the license comment","State":"closed","Body":"This PR ensures that we always prepend the license comment to the beginning of the CSS file.\r\n\r\nWe used to only do this as part of preflight, which means that if you disable preflight then the license comment is not available anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

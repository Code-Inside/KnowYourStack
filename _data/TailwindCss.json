There are workarounds but they would break the consistency of using the dash-prefix for negative values that tailwind employs uniformly. We're building out some re-usable components and want to utilize those font-sizing classes in them so this is a bit of a hindrence. We've temporarily changed the syntax to `h-ms--1` to work around this but its not ideal as it doesnt obey the consistency.\r\n\r\nThe above repo has the full code demo but basically the following is the problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@layer utilities {\r\n\t.h-ms {\r\n\t\t/* Works fine */\r\n\t\t@apply font-header leading-tight;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t.h-ms-1 {\r\n\t\t/* Works fine */\r\n\t\t@apply h-ms text-ms-1 font-bold;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t.-h-ms-1 {\r\n\t\t/* Works fine, `-text-ms-1` is defined in the tailwind config */\r\n\t\t@apply h-ms -text-ms-1 font-bold;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t.new-class {\r\n\t\t/* This throws the below error */\r\n\t\t@apply -h-ms-1 italic;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich then throws the following error (the error goes away if you remove the offending dash-prefixed item in question from the apply statement):\r\n```\r\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'parent' of undefined\r\n    at Root.normalize (/Users/bmf/sites/tailwind-dash-test/node_modules/postcss/lib/container.js:292:15)\r\n    at Root.normalize (/Users/bmf/sites/tailwind-dash-test/node_modules/postcss/lib/root.js:25:23)\r\n    at Root.insertAfter (/Users/bmf/sites/tailwind-dash-test/node_modules/postcss/lib/container.js:201:22)\r\n    at Rule.after (/Users/bmf/sites/tailwind-dash-test/node_modules/postcss/lib/node.js:161:17)\r\n    at processApply (/Users/bmf/sites/tailwind-dash-test/node_modules/tailwindcss/lib/lib/expandApplyAtRules.js:453:16)\r\n    at /Users/bmf/sites/tailwind-dash-test/node_modules/tailwindcss/lib/lib/expandApplyAtRules.js:471:9\r\n    at /Users/bmf/sites/tailwind-dash-test/node_modules/tailwindcss/lib/processTailwindFeatures.js:55:50\r\n    at Object.Once (/Users/bmf/sites/tailwind-dash-test/node_modules/tailwindcss/lib/cli.js:682:27)\r\n    at LazyResult.runOnRoot (/Users/bmf/sites/tailwind-dash-test/node_modules/postcss/lib/lazy-result.js:337:23)\r\n    at LazyResult.runAsync (/Users/bmf/sites/tailwind-dash-test/node_modules/postcss/lib/lazy-result.js:393:26)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there another way to approach this that would work?

From the little bit of testing I've done it could be a bug or missing feature, but I wanted to ask here in case I'm missing something obvious.\r\n\r\nHere are the relevant parts of my config:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  theme: {\r\n    extend: {\r\n      colors: {\r\n        foobar: ({ opacityValue }) => `rgb(255 100 0 / ${opacityValue})`,\r\n      },\r\n      typography: ({ theme }) => ({\r\n        theme: {\r\n          css: {\r\n            '--tw-prose-headings': theme('colors.red[500] / 50%'), // this works\r\n            '--tw-prose-bullets': theme('colors.foobar / 80%'), // this does not\r\n          },\r\n        },\r\n      }),\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've also tried using the new `<alpha-value>` syntax. The `text-foobar/80` etc classes _do_ work in my template files, but `opacityValue` seems to be `undefined` when referencing it in the config. i.e. the above outputs `rgb(255 100 0 / undefined)` for `--tw-prose-bullets`.</div>\r\n\r\n### My analysis of this issue\r\n\r\nThe code that resolves alpha values in `theme()` function is:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/14542d94f7078dc8d065ddcc6d403cd0a467f1be/src/util/resolveConfig.js#L176-L186\r\n\r\nThis code expects there to be more that 2 components in the path; let's see why.\r\n\r\n#### 3-part color\r\n\r\n##### Initial state\r\n```js\r\nindex = 0;\r\nval = {\r\n  // …\r\n  colors: someResolvingFunction,\r\n  // …\r\n};\r\npath = ['colors', 'red', '500']; // also path.alpha = '50%';\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### While loop 1\r\n```js\r\nval = val[path[index++]]`\r\n// index = 1; val = someResolvingFunction\r\nlet shouldResolveAsFn =\r\n          isFunction(val) && (path.alpha === undefined || index < path.length - 1)\r\n// shouldResolveAsFn = true, since index < path.length - 1 is true as index = 1, path.length - 1 = 2.\r\nval = shouldResolveAsFn ? val(resolvePath, configUtils) : val\r\n// val = {\r\n//  …,\r\n//  red: {\r\n//    …,\r\n//    500: '#ef4444',\r\n//    …\r\n//  },\r\n//  …\r\n//  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### While loop 2\r\n```js\r\nval = val[path[index++]]`\r\n// index = 2; val = val['red'] = { …, 500: '#ef4444', … }\r\nlet shouldResolveAsFn =\r\n          isFunction(val) && (path.alpha === undefined || index < path.length - 1)\r\n// shouldResolveAsFn = false, since isFunction(val) = false\r\nval = shouldResolveAsFn ? val(resolvePath, configUtils) : val\r\n// val = { …, 500: '#ef4444', … }\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### While loop 3\r\n```js\r\nval = val[path[index++]]`\r\n// index = 3; val = val['500'] = { …, 500: '#ef4444', … }['500'] = '#ef4444'\r\nlet shouldResolveAsFn =\r\n          isFunction(val) && (path.alpha === undefined || index < path.length - 1)\r\n// shouldResolveAsFn = false, since isFunction(val) = false\r\nval = shouldResolveAsFn ? val(resolvePath, configUtils) : val\r\n// val = '#ef4444'\r\n```\r\nWhile loop stops since the condition `index < path.length` now evaluates to `false` and our final `val` value is `#ef4444`, all good ✔.\r\n\r\n#### 2-part color\r\n\r\n##### Initial state\r\n```js\r\nindex = 0;\r\nval = {\r\n  // …\r\n  colors: someResolvingFunction,\r\n  // …\r\n};\r\npath = ['colors', 'foobar']; // also path.alpha = '80%';\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### While loop 1\r\n```js\r\nval = val[path[index++]]`\r\n// index = 1; val = someResolvingFunction\r\nlet shouldResolveAsFn =\r\n          isFunction(val) && (path.alpha === undefined || index < path.length - 1)\r\n// shouldResolveAsFn = false, since index < path.length - 1 is false as index = 1, path.length - 1 = 1.\r\nval = shouldResolveAsFn ? val(resolvePath, configUtils) : val\r\n// val = someResolvingFunction\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### While loop 2\r\n```js\r\nval = val[path[index++]]`\r\n// index = 2; val = someResolvingFunction['foobar'] = undefined\r\n// val is now undefined so no value is printed.\r\n```\r\nWhile loop stops since the condition `val !== undefined` now evaluates to `false` and our final `val` value is `undefined`, not good ❌.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nThis is because in the first while loop of 2-part color, the `index < path.length - 1` condition stops `someResolvingFunction` from being evaluated as a function and instead, the function is passed through as-is.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/8991","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Custom color opacity in theme function\" (#8991)"},{"Id":"1325994826","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-02T15:13:04","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"9008","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix resolution of alpha values inside color functions","State":"closed","Body":"The default config in Tailwind CSS makes `theme.colors` a function that gets resolved.

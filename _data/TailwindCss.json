However, I noticed that these styles work in a full production build. The GitHub repo link above is a minimal example of this issue. The Tailwind Play link above is the same code, but it works (my guess is that the CSS is being generated differently compared to my Next.js project).\n\nI noticed something interesting when poking around the generated CSS files in dev mode in `.next/static/chunks`.  The generated CSS source map file has the `ms-4` and `me-4` styles, but the CSS file that corresponds to that source map doesn't have these styles.\n\nWe have used similar styles such as `sm:ms-4` extensively in a different Next.js project that uses Tailwind V3 instead, and these styles work in dev mode in that project.\n\nI also found this similar issue, but it has been closed: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/16438\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18949","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ms/me not working with responsive breakpoints in dev mode\" (#18949)"},{"Id":"3423017308","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-16T19:04:13","Actor":"bvandercar-vt","Number":"18948","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use `default` export condition for `@tailwindcss/vite`","State":"closed","Body":"## Summary\r\n\r\nIn `@tailwindcss/vite` 's `package.json`, change the `exports` key from `include` to `default` since there is no `require` case.\r\n\r\nRan into an issue using the `tsx` package to run a script that has a sub-dependency that imports from `@tailwindcss/vite`, where `tsx` converts things to cjs to run, and since there is no `require` case for this package, it can't find the file.

We do this because otherwise we would have to parse a lot more CSS syntax and validate it even though it would be valid CSS in 99.99% of the cases.\r\n\r\nEven worse, if you want to use newer CSS syntax that Tailwind CSS doesn't validate yet, then you would get warnings for valid CSS.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why we don't do this is because the browser already does a great job at ignoring invalid CSS.\r\n\r\nSo the linked issue #15872 would still silently fail in development mode. In this case, everything would work, except the shadow with the invalid syntax.\r\n\r\nBut in production mode, you would now get a proper warning from Lightning CSS, because they try to optimize the CSS and remove invalid CSS.\r\n\r\nOne potential issue here is that we run Lightning CSS on the generated CSS, not on the input CSS. So the current output shows the warnings in the output CSS not the input CSS. Any thoughts if we would just skip the line numbers?\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\n1. Everything works as before\r\n2. In production mode, you would get warnings printed to the terminal.

This complements the existing mobile-first `--breakpoint-*` system by providing max-width media\r\nqueries.\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\n\r\nCurrently, Tailwind v4 only supports mobile-first breakpoints via --breakpoint-* variables, which generate min-width media queries. Many designers and teams prefer desktop-first workflows where styles are defined for larger\r\nscreens and then overridden for smaller devices.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly useful for:\r\n- Teams migrating from Webflow or other desktop-first CSS frameworks\r\n- Projects that start with desktop designs and adapt down to mobile\r\n- Situations where max-width queries provide cleaner, more intuitive CSS\r\n\r\nChanges\r\n\r\nImplementation\r\n\r\n- Added --max-breakpoint-* variant support in src/variants.ts\r\n- Creates static variants for each --max-breakpoint-* theme variable\r\n- Generates max-width media queries using the same format as existing max-* variants\r\n- Uses descending sort order (largest breakpoints first) for proper CSS cascade\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n\r\nDefine desktop-first breakpoints in your theme:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@theme {\r\n  --max-breakpoint-phone: 501px;\r\n  --max-breakpoint-tablet: 1001px;\r\n  --max-breakpoint-desktop: 1441px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse them with intuitive, semantic class names:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Desktop-first: starts as flex-row, becomes flex-col on phones -->\r\n<div class=\"flex flex-row phone:flex-col\">\r\n  <div>Content</div>\r\n  <div>Sidebar</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<!-- Mixed approach: combine with existing min-width breakpoints -->\r\n<div class=\"md:grid md:grid-cols-2 tablet:block phone:text-center\">\r\n  <!-- ... -->  \r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nGenerated CSS:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@media not all and (min-width: 1441px) {\r\n  .desktop\\:hidden { display: none; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media not all and (min-width: 1001px) {\r\n  .tablet\\:block { display: block; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@media not all and (min-width: 501px) {\r\n  .phone\\:flex-col { flex-direction: column; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n\r\n- Semantic naming: Allow the use of meaningful breakpoint names like phone, tablet, desktop instead of size-based names\r\n- Desktop-first workflow: Define base styles for large screens, override for smaller devices\r\n- Seamless integration: Works alongside existing `--breakpoint-*` variables\r\n- Consistent behavior: Uses the same media query format and parsing logic as existing `@max-width` variants\r\n- Proper ordering: Automatically sorts breakpoints in descending order for optimal CSS cascade\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n\r\nAdded comprehensive test coverage including:\r\n- Basic functionality with custom breakpoint names\r\n- Breakpoint ordering (descending for max-width queries)\r\n- Mixed usage with existing min-width breakpoints\r\n- Edge cases and proper CSS generation\r\n\r\nAll existing tests continue to pass, ensuring no breaking changes.\r\n\r\nBackward Compatibility\r\n\r\nThis is a purely additive change that doesn't affect existing functionality:\r\n- Existing `--breakpoint-*` variables continue to work exactly as before\r\n- No changes to existing API or behavior\r\n- Can be used alongside existing breakpoint system\r\n\r\nExample Use Cases\r\n\r\nWebflow-style migration:\r\n```css\r\n@theme {\r\n  --max-breakpoint-tablet: 991px;\r\n  --max-breakpoint-mobile-landscape: 767px;\r\n  --max-breakpoint-mobile-portrait: 479px;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nComponent-specific responsive design:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<nav class=\"desktop:flex desktop:justify-between tablet:block mobile:text-center\">\r\n<!-- Navigation that stacks on smaller screens -->\r\n</nav>\r\n\r\nMixed responsive strategies:\r\n<div class=\"lg:grid lg:grid-cols-3 tablet:grid tablet:grid-cols-2 mobile:block\">\r\n<!-- Hybrid approach using both min and max width breakpoints -->\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis feature provides developers with more flexibility in their responsive design workflows while maintaining Tailwind's utility-first philosophy and consistent API patterns.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18917","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add support for `--max-breakpoint-*` theme variables\" (#18917)"},{"Id":"3399155320","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-09-10T13:57:30","Actor":"aihowes","Number":"18906","RawContent":null,"Title":"Grid column start and end generating `grid-column:` css properties","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

We've got an [upstream bug report](https://github.com/phoenixframework/tailwind/issues/129#issuecomment-3272275554) that the app.css output does not change when editing the input app.css in a Phoenix project on Windows. I've tracked it down to the following:\n\nWhen spawning the Tailwind CLI from Elixir using this command\n\n```\nSystem.cmd(\"C:/path/to/tailwind-windows-x64.exe\", [\"--input=assets/css/app.css\", \"--output=priv/static/assets/css/app.css\", \"--watch\"], into: IO.stream(:stdio, :line))\n```\n\neverything is good. But when passing a working directory to execute the command under\n\n```\nSystem.cmd(\"C:/path/to/tailwind-windows-x64.exe\", [\"--input=assets/css/app.css\", \"--output=priv/static/assets/css/app.css\", \"--watch\"], cd: File.cwd!(), into: IO.stream(:stdio, :line))\n```\n\nthe output app.css does indeed not update. Looking at the working directories in those cases, the difference is that when Elixir passes the working directory, it is passed with a lowercase drive letter:\n\n```\niex(1)> System.cmd(\"node\", [\"-e\", \"console.log(process.cwd())\"])\n{\"C:\\\\Users\\\\Steffen\\\\example_app\\n\", 0}\niex(2)> System.cmd(\"node\", [\"-e\", \"console.log(process.cwd())\"], cd: File.cwd!())\n{\"c:\\\\Users\\\\Steffen\\\\example_app\\n\", 0}\n```\n\nI'm not familiar with your watcher, so this may also be an upstream bug somewhere else, but I figured you'll be able to triage this better than me.

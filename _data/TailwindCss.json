utilities","State":"closed","Body":"Sometimes you're generating classes that you don't want to generate because they're matched in your content.\r\n\r\nFor example, we have a `container` class. If your content has the word `container` in it somewhere that's not meant to be an actual class we would still generate it.\r\nAnother case is you have a class like `collapse` that is shared by Tailwind CSS and another framework that you're using and the behavior between the two is different.\r\n\r\nHistorically, we've recommended disabling the core plugin that generates these classes and then either adding custom CSS or a plugin to your own config that generates the classes you want. \r\n\r\nFor example, to disable the `collapse` utility you would add this to your config:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// tailwind.config.js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  content: [\r\n    \"./src/**/*.html\",\r\n  ],\r\n  theme: {\r\n    extend: {},\r\n  },\r\n  corePlugins: {\r\n    // 1. Disable the `collapse` utility *and* all other `visibility` utilities\r\n    visibility: false,\r\n  },\r\n  plugins: [\r\n    // 2. Re-add the needed `visibility` utilities\r\n    function ({ addUtilities }) {\r\n      addUtilities({\r\n        '.visible': { visibility: 'visible' },\r\n        '.invisible': { visibility: 'hidden' },\r\n      })\r\n    },\r\n  ],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this solution is less than ideal because the resulting CSS will be in a different order and you have to replicate most of the core plugin in your own config file.\r\n\r\nHere we're introducing a new `blocklist` option that allows you to selectively disable generation of utilities that you do not want. For the situation above, with the `collapse` utility, you would now add this to your config:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// tailwind.config.js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  // 1. Disable generation of the `collapse` utility ONLY\r\n  blocklist: ['collapse'],\r\n  content: [\r\n    \"./src/**/*.html\",\r\n  ],\r\n  theme: {\r\n    extend: {},\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe utilities are matched by their exact class names. This means that if you want to block `hover:mx-auto` you would add `hover:mx-auto` to the blocklist. Simply including `mx-auto` on it's own will not prevent variants from being generated if they are matched.\r\n\r\n> **Note**\r\n> This blocklist does NOT affect user CSS, so if you have a class like `collapse` in your own CSS (or coming from another library you are using) it will still be included in the output.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/9812","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Allow users to block generation of certain utilities\" (#9812)"},{"Id":"1445603396","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-11T15:17:02","Actor":"TTransmit","Number":"9809","RawContent":null,"Title":"Border styles not applying in custom layers","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

I'm not sure if custom layers are supported but it was an unexpected behaviour. Borders work from `@layer base` and `@layer components` but not from `@layer customlayer`. \r\n\r\nMy main use case for a custom layer was as a way to differentiate between styles for different features - visually in the code. I'm guessing I should be using something like postcss-import and have different files for a large project using tailwind. \r\n\r\n```css\r\n@tailwind base;\r\n@tailwind components;\r\n@tailwind utilities;\r\n\r\n@layer base {\r\n\r\n    .border-shows-with-this {\r\n        @apply h-48 w-48 bg-red-600 m-4 border-green-600 border-4;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@layer components {\r\n\r\n    .border-also-shows-with-this {\r\n        @apply h-48 w-48 bg-red-600 m-4 border-green-600 border-4;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@layer different-layer {\r\n\r\n    .border-missing-with-this {\r\n        @apply h-48 w-48 bg-red-600 m-4 border-green-600 border-4;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/9809","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Border styles not applying in custom layers\" (#9809)"},{"Id":"1444590391","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-11T15:14:15","Actor":"rhukster","Number":"9798","RawContent":null,"Title":"Problem with invalid classname in custom CSS using @apply when watching","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\nTailwind 3.2.3\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\nFor example: v19.0.1\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\n\r\nmacOS 12.6\r\n\r\n**Steps to reproduce**\r\n\r\nDownload the small example test project:\r\n\r\n[tailwind-crash.zip](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/files/9985239/tailwind-crash.zip)\r\n\r\nFollow the instructions in the `README.md`\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nI use a pretty basic setup with CLI scripts in `package.json` like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"postcss8-tailwind\",\r\n  \"repository\": \"\",\r\n  \"private\": true,\r\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\r\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\r\n  \"license\": \"MIT\",\r\n  \"scripts\": {\r\n    \"dev\": \"tailwindcss -i ./css/site.css -o ./build/css/site.css --postcss --minify --watch\",\r\n    \"prod\": \"NODE_ENV=production tailwindcss -i ./css/site.css -o ./build/css/site.css --postcss --minify\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"dependencies\": {\r\n    \"@tailwindcss/forms\": \"^0.5.3\",\r\n    \"@tailwindcss/typography\": \"^0.5.8\",\r\n    \"alpinejs\": \"^3.10.5\",\r\n    \"postcss-import\": \"^15.0.0\",\r\n    \"tailwindcss-debug-screens\": \"^2.2.1\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"devDependencies\": {\r\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.13\",\r\n    \"postcss\": \"^8.4.18\",\r\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.2.3\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the JIT, i mainly just use `dev` script to compile my CSS while watching.  The normal and expected behavior when accidentally typing an invalid classname, was the the compiler would see the change, attempt to recompile and spit out an error indicating the line number and invalid class in question.  For a few weeks i've noticed that I would not get this neat output, rather it would stack-trace, and I would have to scroll up in the terminal to find the first line that indicated the file, line number and the class in question that was in valid.\r\n\r\nFor the past couple of days I've noticed that rather than this stack trace, the compile just gets stuck after the `Rebuilding...` text is output.  No errors, no messages.  Fixing the bad class, causes the file to recompile again with the `Done in XXms` message.  I now have to notice it got stuck manually exit out of the watch, then manually run the command again from CLI to get the stacktrace that I can then scroll back to find the bad classname.\r\n\r\nI've updated everything i can think of, including moving from Node 18 to latest Node 19.0.1.  I get this error over multiple projects, so it's not just this one instance. Is there any known issues with the latest version of `PostCSS` or is this coming from `tailwindcss` specifically?\r\n\r\nExample of the partial StackTrace when running:\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜ npm run dev\r\n\r\n> postcss8-tailwind@1.0.0 dev\r\n> tailwindcss -i ./css/site.css -o ./build/css/site.css --postcss --minify --watch\r\n\r\n\r\nRebuilding...\r\n/Users/joe/Projects/www/my-site/theme/custom/node_modules/postcss/lib/input.js:148\r\n      result = new CssSyntaxError(\r\n               ^\r\n\r\nCssSyntaxError: tailwindcss: /Users/joe/Projects/www/my-site/theme/custom/css/custom/typography.css:5:5: The `right-0x` class does not exist.

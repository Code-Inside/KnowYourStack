In case you want to run a full build again (e.g.: when a CSS file changed), then you can call the `compile` function again.\n\nAll potential caches are scoped to the `compile` function, which means that if you call `compile` again, you will get a fresh instance (and the old caches can be garbage collected).\n\nThis PR also introduces more dedicated methods on the internal `DesignSystem` for parsing candidates, parsing variants and compiling AST nodes from candidates.\n\nAll these methods are behind caches, so we don't do unnecessary work and re-use everything as much as possible. All objects will use the same instance which means that we can compare them by reference when needed.\n\nThis also includes optimizations for incremental rebuilds, such as:\n\n- Don't even try to handle known invalid candidates.\n- Skip re-printing the AST to CSS when the generated AST is the same as the previous one.\n- Skip work if no new candidates are detected.\n\n\n<!--\n\nðŸ‘‹ Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

It has quite a few configuration and extensions but I narrowed it down to two things, but one of those is the `important:true` config.\r\n\r\nSome figures (and the output is a ~900 lines css) without `important:true` it's taking ~2s, with `important: true` ~10s.

I find it very odd that just adding !important to every class makes that much of a difference so I'd thought of flagging this.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/12284","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"important:true is making 10x slower (sometimes more)\" (#12284)"},{"Id":"1962109432","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-25T20:27:29","Actor":"frank-laemmer","Number":"12290","RawContent":null,"Title":"Breakpoint text size VS line-height","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\nv3.3.5\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\n\r\nhttps://play.tailwindcss.com/wfrFmp1hfs\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1401\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-25 at 21 27 53\" src=\"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/962736/e5f12eef-7b50-4c14-9af4-431920849e18\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nI apply a text modifier (breakpoint prefix) to text size.

Specifically:\r\n\r\n* Include the generated type `DefaultTheme` in the return value\r\n* If a theme key is set in `config.theme`, it overrides the default theme value\r\n* If a theme key is extended in `config.theme.extend`, it's intersected with the resolved theme value\r\n* Custom theme keys set in the user config will also still show up in the return type\r\n\r\nThe generated `DefaultTheme` type doesn't itself contain all possible theme config keys (those that are defined via a callback are omitted), so we fall back to values from `ThemeConfig`, which are of a less concrete type (eg. `KeyValuePair<string, string>`).\r\n\r\nBasically, I think I've implemented the \"ridiculousness with conditional types\" mentioned in [the review for this PR](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/9972/files#r1035948691)\r\n\r\n### Incidental changes\r\n\r\nA couple of small changes were necessary elsewhere in the codebase to facilitate this:\r\n\r\n**`generate-types.js`**: Do not intersect the generated `DefaultTheme` type with `Config['theme']`. We need to use the concrete value types in here to improve the `ResolvedConfig` type, and the `Config['theme']` types get in the way of this. As far as I can see, the only place where `DefaultTheme` is currently referenced is in `defaultTheme.d.ts` where it is once again intersected with `Config['theme']`, so this change shouldn't make a difference to that.\r\n\r\n**`config.d.ts`**: I exported `ThemeConfig` to use in `ResolvedConfig`, and I also split out a separate `ThemeConfigCustomizable` interface which includes the final `[key: string]: any`. Otherwise there was no way to avoid `ResolvedConfig` itself including a fallback `[key: string]: any`, rendering any unknown property access valid in typescript's eye.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nGiven that the codebase itself isn't written in typescript, I wasn't sure of a good way to test the changes. I resorted to creating a sample ts file defining a config, resolving it, and trying to access various keys on the output---using my IDE for typescript feedback.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Example test file</summary>\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport { Config } from './types/config'\r\nimport resolveConfig = require('./resolveConfig')\r\n\r\nconst config = {\r\n  content: ['**/*.js'],\r\n  theme: {\r\n    gap: {\r\n      1: '1',\r\n      2: '2',\r\n    },\r\n    myCustom: {\r\n      foo: 'custom',\r\n      bar: 'custom',\r\n    },\r\n    extend: {\r\n      colors: {\r\n        cerulean: {\r\n          50: 'bla',\r\n          100: 'yeah',\r\n          200: 'another',\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      gap: {\r\n        3: '3'\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n} satisfies Config\r\n\r\nconst theme = resolveConfig(config).theme\r\n\r\ntheme.colors.cerulean // ✅\r\ntheme.colors.zinc // ✅\r\ntheme.gap // { 1, 2, 3 }\r\ntheme.spacing // { 0, 1, 2, 3, ... }\r\ntheme.padding // KeyValuePair<string, string>\r\n// @ts-expect-error\r\ntheme.extend\r\n// @ts-expect-error\r\ntheme.bla\r\ntheme.myCustom // ✅\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nI'd gladly do more real-world testing or add tests to the codebase if an approach could be suggested.\r\n\r\nThis is my first PR to a large-scale OS project.

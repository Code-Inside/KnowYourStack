If this is used with `value(…)`, it's a signal to Tailwind to treat the value + modifier as a single value:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/* The CSS `ratio` type is our signal to treat the value + modifier as a fraction */\r\n@utility aspect-* {\r\n  /* aspect-square, aspect-3/4, aspect-[7/9] */\r\n  aspect-ratio: value(--aspect-ratio-*, ratio, [ratio]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/15455","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add functional utility syntax\" (#15455)"},{"Id":"2750729711","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-19T15:40:59","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"15454","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update jiti 2.4.0 → 2.4.1 (patch)","State":"open","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

This issue was [first reported](https://github.com/rails/tailwindcss-rails/discussions/441#discussion-7616317) on December 5th. \r\nI'm wondering if anyone from the Tailwind team would have a better idea, given that timing, of what might have changed that would introduce a downstream issue with the `tailwindcss-rails` gem. \r\n\r\nAny help is much appreciated, and if I can assist in providing any better reproduction/troubleshooting steps, I'm happy to do so!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/15426","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Style output via `tailwindcss-rails` gem appears off when compared to other build options\" (#15426)"},{"Id":"2749660695","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-19T10:44:20","Actor":"dany68","Number":"15443","RawContent":null,"Title":"Components are not working with utilities classes","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\nTailwind v4.0.0-beta.8\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\nVite v5.4.11, in an electron-vite app\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\nv22.11.0\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\n\r\nChrome (electronjs version 31.7.6  app)\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\n\r\nMacOS\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nIt seems components cannot have utilities such as md:, lg: or dark: applied to it.

Is there a known fix? Imo it seems more like an issue with Safari not properly implementing the latest nested CSS standard than TailwindCSS, but maybe Tailwind is doing some non standard things?\r\n\r\n> Note I have also open an issue on Webkit bugzilla: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=284746 ","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/15406","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Nested CSS not supported in Safari\" (#15406)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2024-12-21T03:30:24.7935178Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":534}

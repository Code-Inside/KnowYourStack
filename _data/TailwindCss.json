This would be the very first time that the documentation for a utility didn't include any sort of reference table which felt like a smell and led us to look for other ways to approach this feature.\r\n\r\nFor a while we were convinced that the best way to implement this feature would actually be to deprecate the existing `listStyleType` utilities in favor of a generic `listStyle` plugin that targeted the `list-style` shorthand property in CSS. There's not a lot of point in setting both `list-style-type` and `list-style-image` on an element, so combining these into a single abstraction in Tailwind felt like a nice convenience to the end user, and would allow them to configure custom types and images under a single key in their `tailwind.config.js` file.\r\n\r\nWe worked on this for quite a while but ultimately decided against that approach for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. **Significant complexity needed for backwards compatibility**. We take backwards compatibility pretty seriously and wanted to make sure that we could introduce a new `listStyle` plugin without forcing users to have to make any changes to their project to upgrade.\r\n\r\n    This meant we needed to make sure customization theme values added to `listStyleType` were automatically inherited by the new `listStyle` plugin, that calls to `theme('listStyleType.disc')` still worked in both your CSS and within JS plugins, and that if you'd disabled the `listStyleType` core plugin that the `listStyle` plugin would be disabled. On top of this, we wanted to issue warnings for anyone interacting with the old APIs to motivate them to replace their use of `listStyleType` with `listStyle`.\r\n\r\n    The more we worked on this, the more nasty edge cases we found where the correct behavior felt very hard to decide on, and where handling even the edge cases we did know how to handle was introducing lots of nasty conditional code throughout many different places in the codebase. This just felt like a smell and forced us to step back and consider if there were any other solutions.\r\n\r\n2. **The `list-style` property doesn't compose with `list-style-position`**. The `list-style` shorthand property is short for `list-style-type`, `list-style-image`, _and_ `list-style-position`. That means if you set `list-style` after setting any of those properties, those properties are overridden.\r\n\r\n    This shows up as a problem when applying classes conditionally, for example:\r\n\r\n    ```html\r\n    <ul class=\"list-disc list-inside md:list-decimal\">\r\n      <!-- ... -->\r\n    </ul>\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    In the above example, if we used `list-style` to implement `list-decimal`, then `md:list-decimal` would override the `list-style-position` set by `list-inside`. In practice this probably isn't a big deal because it's pretty strange to change the bullet style conditionally, but it was a signal that using the generic `list-style` property was probably not the right solution.\r\n\r\nUltimately we decided to go with the first implementation idea which is a dedicated `listStyleImage` plugin, but solve the documentation problem by combining both `listStyleImage` and `listStyleType` into a single documentation page called \"List Style Type / Image\", much like we do with the `grid-column`, `grid-column-start`, and `grid-column-end` utilities.\r\n\r\nWe also decided to include `none` as a default value for `listStyleImage` just to make sure things like this would work:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<ul class=\"list-cupcake md:list-none\">\r\n  <!-- ... -->\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause `listStyleType` also includes `none` as a default value, this means that using `list-none` in your markup will generate two classes:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.list-none {\r\n  list-style-type: none;\r\n}\r\n.list-none {\r\n  list-style-image: none;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe considered writing some special case code here so that we could just include `none` under `listStyleType` but automatically use `list-style` instead of `list-style-type` just for the `none` value, but that would have the same issues I mentioned in point 2 above where it breaks composability. It also just feels dirty to special case things in the codebase, and is usually a sign that we're doing something we shouldn't be doing.\r\n\r\nOne minor downside to `list-none` working this way is that if for some reason you really want to set both a type and an image but unset just the type or image at a different breakpoint, you can't, because `list-none` will always unset both:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Will unset both the type and image -->\r\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-cupcake md:list-none\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven respecifying the one you want to keep won't work, because it will collide with the version of `list-none` that comes from that same core plugin:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Still won't work -->\r\n<ul class=\"list-disc list-cupcake md:list-none md:list-cupcake\">\r\n```\r\n\r\n**This feels like something we need to solve before merging**, as it's another one of those weird smells that just tells me our approach here isn't right. So far, I have two ideas but am not in love with either of them:\r\n\r\n1. **Use different names**. Maybe `list-none` is for `list-style-type` for BC reasons, and `list-image-none` or `list-no-image` is used for `list-style-image`. Would work, name options just suck.\r\n\r\n2. **Special case `list-none`**. Maybe we add `list-none` using `addUtilities` so it is always sorted before custom values. This would work but it would be the first time we've mixed `addUtilities` and `matchUtilities` in the same plugin, and any time we do something for the first time we need to think carefully about if we want to set that precedent.\r\n\r\nGoing to leave this open for now and probably waste four more hours talking about it with @reinink when he's back from vacation on Monday.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/10817","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add `list-style-image` support\" (#10817)"},{"Id":"1629484024","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-17T15:22:16","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"10815","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ensure integration tests are using `@swc/jest` transforms","State":"closed","Body":"This PR fixes a bug on `master`, where the integration tests are not running anymore.\n\nIn the `customMatchers` we are now always spying on the `log.warn` function.

This was surprising to people using `\"type\": \"module\"` in their projects, and made it more difficult to do things like extract your theme tokens into a separate module that you could import into your `tailwind.config.js` as well as into your application code to maintain a single source of truth.\r\n\r\nTo make this work, we need to transpile ESM and TS config files on the fly (using [jiti](https://github.com/unjs/jiti)), since Tailwind itself isn't published in native ESM and of course there's no native TS support in Node.js. This means there is a performance penalty to using ESM and TS config files, which we're mitigating as much as possible by using [Sucrase](https://github.com/alangpierce/sucrase) as the parser instead of Babel. The penalty on my machine is about ~10ms (~50ms using Babel) for one-off builds and the initial build in watch mode, and basically not measurable for incremental builds.\r\n\r\n### CLI improvements\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds `--esm` and `--ts` flags to the `tailwindcss init` CLI command to generate your config file using your preferred syntax:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpx tailwindcss init --esm\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen running the `init` command with no flags, Tailwind will guess which syntax to use based on the `\"type\"` field in your `package.json`.\r\n\r\nWhen using the `--postcss` flag, the generated `postcss.config.js` file will use the same syntax as your `tailwind.config.js` file, whether inferred or specified explicitly on the command line.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@natemoo-re and @innocenzi have been credited as co-authors for their efforts in earlier PRs:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/7327\r\n- https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/3544\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/10785","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Enable ESM and TS based config files\" (#10785)"},{"Id":"1626082650","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-15T19:01:35","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"10805","RawContent":null,"Title":"🚨 [security] Upgrade webpack: 4.46.0 → 5.76.1 (major)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n<hr>\n\n🚨 <b>Your current dependencies have known security vulnerabilities</b> 🚨\n\nThis dependency update fixes known security vulnerabilities.

Using `:is()`, all three of these DOM structures just work:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<html dir=\"rtl\" class=\"dark\">\r\n  <!-- ... -->\r\n    <p class=\"rtl:dark:italic\">Hello world.</p>\r\n  <!-- ... -->\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\r\n  <div class=\"dark\">\r\n    <p class=\"rtl:dark:italic\">Hello world.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"dark\">\r\n  <div dir=\"rtl\">\r\n    <p class=\"rtl:dark:italic\">Hello world.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Browser support for `:is()` is very good](https://caniuse.com/css-matches-pseudo) at this point, with support back to Safari 14 which is close to three years old.\r\n\r\nTailwind already uses CSS features that rely on even newer browsers (like native `aspect-ratio` support, as well as `:where()` in Preflight), so it feels reasonable to me to start relying on `:is()` in core as well.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/10766","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Make `dark` and `rtl`/`ltr` variants insensitive to DOM order\" (#10766)"},{"Id":"1619181623","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-10T15:52:08","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"10765","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use `inset` instead of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties","State":"closed","Body":"This PR improves the `inset` utility by using the `inset` property instead of the `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left` properties.\n<!--\n\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

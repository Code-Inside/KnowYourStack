I believe that either the parser should work in a same way in development and production mode, or it should report found errors in css.\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/15872","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"v4: @tailwindcss/vite: Invalid css in @theme section causes the styles to be silently broken in production build only\" (#15872)"},{"Id":"2811184066","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-25T21:28:14","Actor":"userquin","Number":"15869","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix(tailwindcss): default package exports","State":"open","Body":"<!--\r\n\r\nðŸ‘‹ Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

Since both Tailwind CSS v3.0 and v4.0 support the `components` layer, I'd expect the upgrade tool to leave component classes _unmodified_.\n\nHere's a unit test for a simple case (would be added to `packages/@tailwindcss-upgrade/src/codemods/migrate-at-layer-utilities.test.ts`):\n\n```ts\nit('should keep components', async () => {\n  expect(\n    await migrate(css`\n      @layer components {\n        .foo {\n          color: red;\n        }\n      }\n    `),\n  ).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`\n    \"@layer components {\n      .foo {\n        color: red;\n      }\n    }\"\n  `)\n})\n```\n\nThis test fails with the following output:\n\n```diff\n FAIL  src/codemods/migrate-at-layer-utilities.test.ts > should keep components\nError: Snapshot `should keep components 1` mismatched\n\n- Expected\n+ Received\n\n- \"@layer components {\n-   .foo {\n+ \"@utility foo {\n-     color: red;\n+   color: red;\n-   }\n  }\"\n```","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/15868","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Upgrade tool converts component classes to custom utilities\" (#15868)"},{"Id":"2811132585","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-25T19:05:19","Actor":"nilshelmig","Number":"15864","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] preflight removed margins conflicts with web-component :host styles","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

While upgrading to tailwindcss-v4 we encountered wrong paddings of buttons and wrong position and size of dialog boxes.\n\nIt seems because of preflight setting `padding` and `margin` for every element `*` to zero, it overrides the styling rules from `:host` of the custom-web-elements.\n\nCurrently, the only workaround I see is to create a custom preflight, so that setting `padding` and `margin` won't apply to `:host` elements, or set the `padding` and `margin` for the custom element with tailwindcss. The later one would mean more control on our side, but we have to reapply every sizing of material web-components ðŸ˜• \n\n**With preflight enabled**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17e29f80-a5dd-4e4d-9f8a-8d94f3bfd8d5)\n\n**With preflight disabled**\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86383a9d-0439-43f5-bc5c-4607af61923e)","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/15864","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[v4] preflight removed margins conflicts with web-component :host styles\" (#15864)"},{"Id":"2811096837","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-25T17:41:21","Actor":"obecker","Number":"15861","RawContent":null,"Title":"v3 -> v4 upgrade tool should replace `outline` with `outline-solid`","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

This is primarily a problem for websites like [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com) and [uiverse.io](https://uiverse.io) that allow users to create and share web projects in the browser. Having a Tailwind CSS WASM module would allow these websites to continue to support the latest version of Tailwind CSS.\r\n\r\nPossible use-cases for a Tailwind CSS WASM module are:\r\n- [Monaco integration](https://monaco-tailwindcss.js.org/)\r\n- Websites where you can use tailwind with instant preview, like [uiverse.io](https://uiverse.io/) or (to a lesser extent) [21st.dev](https://21st.dev/)\r\n- [StackBlitz](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13133) closing #13133 \r\n\r\n## Approach\r\n\r\nFor now, I copy-pasted the existing node module code and ported it from `napi` to `wasm-bindgen`.

And also v4 docs don't even mention that `outline-color` is now included in the default `transition` property.\n\nThis is what the current documentation says:\n\n```\ntransition-property: color, background-color, border-color, text-decoration-color, fill, stroke, --tw-gradient-from, --tw-gradient-via, --tw-gradient-to, opacity, box-shadow, transform, translate, scale, rotate, filter, -webkit-backdrop-filter, backdrop-filter;\n```\n\nBut this is what in reality is being outputted:\n\n```\ntransition-property: color, background-color, border-color, outline-color, text-decoration-color, fill, stroke, --tw-gradient-from, --tw-gradient-via, --tw-gradient-to, opacity, box-shadow, transform, translate, scale, rotate, filter, -webkit-backdrop-filter, backdrop-filter\n```\n\n\nThis is kind of an issue for us because we're using outline for all our focus states and in v4 there's a weird glitch when the outline on focus appears:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91f6dcba-7d43-4868-b4ae-1bb481852035)\n\nAs you can see, the initial outline color is black (which is equal to `currentColor`) and then it transitions into the specified color. \n\n\nThis, of course, disappears if we remove the `transition` property from the focused element. Or we now need to add `outline-transparent` to get rid of the initial black color but this won't solve the problem that the `outline-color` is now being transitioned (which is not preferred for our project).","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/15827","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[V4] `outline-color` should be excluded from the default `transition-property`\" (#15827)"},{"Id":"2809565447","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-24T16:42:18","Actor":"mikhoil","Number":"15805","RawContent":null,"Title":"Components (custom classes in the @layer component directive) do not work with media queries","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\n4.0.0\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nnextjs 14.2.5 and play.tailwindcss.com\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\n20.15.0\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nChrome\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nWindows\n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\nhttps://play.tailwindcss.com/ND5jWdm8wC\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nIn previous version (3.4.15) custom classes in @layer components have worked with media queries for example <div className=\"md:custom1 custom2\">....</div>, but after updating to version 4.0.0 in my project (or by changing version in play.tailwindcss.com) it doesn't work","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/15805","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Components (custom classes in the @layer component directive) do not work with media queries\" (#15805)"},{"Id":"2809858812","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-24T16:34:35","Actor":"sdavids","Number":"15819","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] Clarify relationship with browserslist","State":"open","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\n4.0.0\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\n`npx @tailwindcss/cli`\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\n22.13.1\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nChrome, Safari, and Firefox\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nmacOS\n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\n```shell\n$ npx @tailwindcss/cli --help\n```\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\n_lightingcss_ is used under the hood.\n\n\nIt supports _browserslist_ for [transpilation](https://lightningcss.dev/transpilation.html#cli).\n\n\nIt should be documented whether _tailwindcss/cli_ uses an existing `.browserslistrc`, evaluates `browserslist` in `package.json`, and/or supports `BROWSERSLIST_CONFIG`/`BROWSERSLIST_ENV` like _lightningcss-cli_.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/15819","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[v4] Clarify relationship with browserslist\" (#15819)"},{"Id":"2809743901","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-24T15:36:48","Actor":"Fedox-die-Ente","Number":"15814","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] Incomplete Functionality of Next.js Module CSS with Tailwind CSS: @apply and Custom Variants Issues","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong but I tried plenty of options and I just cant to unset all the existing tailwind's font-weights.\n```css\n@theme {\n    /* tried to unset this */\n    --font-*: initial;\n    /* and also this */\n    --font-weight-*: initial;\n\n    --font-weight-extraBold: 800;\n    --font-weight-bold: 700;\n    --font-weight-semiBold: 600;\n    --font-weight-normal: 400;\n}\n```\n\nhere it what I get on intellisense, it even multiplies the stuff\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18316ff1-c9a5-48f6-af21-73c82a4acc88)","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/15811","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Can't unset font-weights in v4\" (#15811)"},{"Id":"2809361432","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-01-24T15:14:37","Actor":"H-Sven","Number":"15800","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add custom breakpoints for screens in extend, resulting in the failure of max-*.","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

The repo above (v4bug) worked when someone jumped in and tried it, but not for me.\n\nI switched to a Linux environment, and it still failed for me, but when I created a new account on the Linux machine, it worked! Cloning my v4bug repo into `/tmp`, rather than under my home, also fixed the problem.\n\nLong story short, my home directory has a `.gitignore` file in it, the entire contents of which is `*`. I do this so that I can keep my home directory under git, but not have it pester me to add things I don't want. Anyway, `tailwindcss` seems to look at `.gitignore` files. This is fine, but perhaps it is climbing up the directory tree too far?","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/15804","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"tailwindcss CLI looks at .gitignore files from outside of current repo\" (#15804)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-01-26T03:30:26.3325515Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":476}

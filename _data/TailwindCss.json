This will be most noticeable in Intellisense.\r\n\r\nThe big issue we had is that we used module scoped Map objects where we cache data based on the DesignSystem. If you then create new design systems (often), then the cache would just keep growing and growing.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves that by essentially storing all the caches on the Design System itself. This way, when you throw away a Design System, all the caches go with it.\r\n\r\nAnother approach would've been to use a WeakMap, but then we would have to make sure that no strong references to the DesignSystem exist anywhere else, otherwise we would still have the same memory issues.\r\n\r\nNote: make sure to go commit by commit and use `?w=1` to ignore whitespace changes.\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\n1.

Right now, when you want to convert `[font-weight:400]` to `font-normal` it's not going to work because the signatures don't like up:\n\n```css\n/* [font-weight:400] */\n.x {\n  font-weight: 400;\n}\n\n/* font-normal */\n.x {\n  --tw-font-weight: 400;\n  font-weight: 400;\n}\n```\n\nSo this PR essentially ignores `--tw-{property}` _if_ the `{property}` exists with the exact same value. \n\nThe main reason we have this, is to make composition of utilities easier.\n\nAs with any of these upgrades, they are the expected behavior in most cases, but there could always be a case where you don't want this, but that's why the upgrade tool requires you to review each change before applying it. Intellisense will recommend the simplified class, but it's up to you to decide if you want to apply it or not.\n\nThere is a known edge case for `leading-{num}`, because the property is `line-height` and the CSS variable is `--tw-leading`. Right now we map `--tw-leading` to `line-height` but we can also update the leading classes to use `--tw-line-height` instead but that feels like a bigger breaking change _if_ people rely on these internal CSS variables...\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/19156","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Ignore `--tw-` variables during internal signature computation\" (#19156)"},{"Id":"3527920806","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-20T15:15:31","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"19147","RawContent":null,"Title":"Collapse multiple utilities","State":"closed","Body":"Some commits look like a lot of changes, but they just move things around, so best to use `?w=1` when viewing commit by commit.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new feature to the `designSystem.canonicalizeCandidates` to collapse multiple utilities to fewer utilities. To make this possible, we also have to convert some logical properties to physical properties (controllable via an option).\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nds.canonicalizeCandidates(['w-4', 'h-4'], {\r\n  collapse: true // Default `true`\r\n  logicalToPhysical: true // Default `true`\r\n}) // → ['size-4']\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can already compute the signature of each utility, where if two utilities have the same signature they are considered the same. \r\n\r\nHowever it's kind of impossible to generate all combinations of all utilities ever to figure out if there is a potential collapse possible. Even if we just focus on the incoming list of candidates, there could still be a lot of classes. So instead we have to be a bit more clever.\r\n\r\nFirst, we group candidates together by the used variants and if the important `!` flag was used. We can improve this in the future, but for now we won't even try to combine `hover:w-4 h-4`.\r\n\r\nNext, for each candidate, we figure out which property and value it uses. We can build up a lookup table for this. We already did this process for all utilities in the system as well.\r\n\r\nThe lookup table for `w-4 h-4 p-4` might look something like this.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"width\": {\r\n    \"16px\": [\"w-4\", \"size-4\"],\r\n  },\r\n  \"height\": {\r\n    \"16px\": [\"h-4\", \"size-4\"],\r\n  },\r\n  \"padding\": {\r\n    \"16px\": [\"p-4\"],\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, we can build groups of candidates where an intersection exists in the lookup table. In the example above, we can see that `w-4` and `h-4` both map to `size-4` for the value `16px`. So we can group these two candidates. The `p-4`d doesn't intersect with anything else, so it remains alone. This also means that we only have to generate combinations for two candidates (2^2 = 4) instead of three (2^3 = 8). In practice, your class list might have many classes, so keeping this number low is important.\r\n\r\nWhen we generate combinations, we will generate the most amount of candidates first so we have the largest collapse possible. We also stop when we reach <= 1 combinations because we need at least two candidates to collapse.\r\n\r\nSince this uses the internal design system, if you have custom `@utility`s, this will work as expected.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@utility example {\r\n  @apply border rounded p-4;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you then use:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"border m-0 rounded p-4\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we can collapse this to:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"example m-0\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut even if we used:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"border m-0 rounded pt-4 pb-4 px-4\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would still collapse to:\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"example m-0\"></div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n...because the `pt-4` and `pb-4` can collapse to `py-4`, and `py-4` and `px-4` can collapse to `p-4`.\r\n\r\nThis is also where that logical to physical conversion comes into play, because while `pt-4` and `pb-4` set the physical `padding-top` and `padding-bottom` properties. The `py-4` utility sets the logical `padding-block` property. So we internally transform `padding-block` to the `padding-top` and `padding-bottom` physical properties. The funny thing is that this logical to physical conversion actually means that we will convert `pt-4` and `pb-4` from _physical_ to _logical_ properties, because we converted to `py-4`...\r\n\r\nIn _most_ cases it's fine, and even preferred to use `py-1` over `pt-1 pb-1`, but in case it's not, then you can disable the `logicalToPhysical` option.\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\nAdded some dedicated tests for this new functionality.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/19147","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Collapse multiple utilities\" (#19147)"},{"Id":"3529028945","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-20T13:49:40","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"19148","RawContent":null,"Title":"Incorporate changes from latest `ignore` crate","State":"closed","Body":"This updates our internal fork of the `ignore` crate to incorporate changes from the latest release [v0.4.24](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/compare/ignore-0.4.23...ignore-0.4.24).\r\n\r\nAside: We should look into opening issues about the changes we had to make to see if they could be addressed in the crate itself so we can get rid of our fork.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/19148","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Incorporate changes from latest `ignore` crate\" (#19148)"},{"Id":"3532293253","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-20T12:59:11","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"19160","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update jiti 2.6.0 → 2.6.1 (patch)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

This standard behavior to prevent background scrolling seems to trigger a specific visual artifact in this environment (Tailwind v4.1.14, potentially related to backdrop-blur used on a sticky element like the navigation bar). Instead of just hiding the scroll, a persistent visual \"artifact\" appears on the screen, which looks like a \"white wide scrollbar\". This artifact remains visible for the entire duration the MenuItems component is open and disappears only when the menu closes and the styles are removed from <html>. Standard CSS methods to hide the scrollbar (like scrollbar-width: none; and ::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none; } applied when html has overflow: hidden) do not resolve this particular visual artifact. The issue disappears if the MenuItems component is removed or if the overflow: hidden; padding-right styles are manually removed from <html> in DevTools. This differs slightly from similar reports ( (https://github.com/tailwindlabs/headlessui/issues/762) ) which focus on layout shifts due to padding-right, as the primary issue here is the persistent visual \"scrollbar-like\" artifact while the menu is open.\n\n<img width=\"830\" height=\"188\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c7b4bad-eb32-498e-93d5-0d9f06414d68\" />\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/19153","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Visual artifact (\"white wide scrollbar\") when MenuItems opens, related to overflow: hidden on <html> and possibly Tailwind v4 / backdrop-blur\" (#19153)"},{"Id":"3529769393","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-19T08:50:21","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"19149","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove Oxide postinstall script","State":"closed","Body":"This PR effectively reverts #17929.\r\n\r\nThe bug in npm that required it was fixed a couple of months ago and with recent changes to pnpm that requires manually approving all postinstall scripts, this is creating some unnecessary noise.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/19149","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Remove Oxide postinstall script\" (#19149)"},{"Id":"3527673007","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-17T22:14:48","Actor":"hyperz111","Number":"19146","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update lightningcss to 1.30.2","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

In the former issue(node v 22) extraneous dependencies cannot be removed by standard methods (npm uninstall, npm prune, --ignore-scripts, etc.) and persist after installation and get reinstalled by post install scripts from `napi-postinstall` causing confusion and potentially interfering with clean environments or minimal builds.\n\nKeep in mind these steps have only been identified when the sharp package is present either as a direct or as a transitive dependency. `Sharp` is a transitive dependency by default in all `next.js` projects. \n\nYou can reproduce these issues here: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/reproduction-template?file=%2F.gitignore\n\nThis issue originally was brought up here: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/84450 and https://github.com/lovell/sharp/issues/4464 was thought to be caused by `create-next-app`, and the sharp packages Emscripten detection which uses similar WebAssembly binaries as tailwind and rebuilds them post-install https://github.com/lovell/sharp/issues/4442. \n\nThe two specific packages thought to explain the issue now are `eslint-config-next@15.5.4` and `@tailwindcss/postcss@4.1.14` by the way of `tailwindcss/oxide-wasm32-wasi`, `unrs-resolver` (optional dependency of eslint-config-next.js).  See full explanation here: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/84450#issuecomment-3393868023\n\n\n**Here are the exact steps to reproduce the issues using node version 22.10.0** \n\nTo

Everything went fairly okay, no need to dive too deep into it.\n\nThe actual issue I have (which caused things to not work properly) is that the `content` field from `tailwind.config.ts` was not properly migrated to my `globals.css` file. I'm having a monorepo, but the example would give you more clarity:\n\n```ts\n// root/apps/web/tailwind.config.ts\nconst config: Config = {\n  darkMode: ['class'],\n  content: [\n    // more here, it's a big and complex monorepo, but the example will make it clear\n    './node_modules/@heroui/theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',\n  ],\n```\n\nSince I'm using Next.js, `tailwind.config.ts` is inside `root/apps/web/` (my web app), which has a tailwind dependency. And it makes sense, since heroui is installed inside `root/apps/web/node_modules`.\n\nThen, after the upgrade, I get this:\n\n```css\n/* root/apps/web/src/ui/styles/globals.css */\n@source '../../../../../node_modules/@heroui/theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}';\n```\n\nIt took me some time to figure out why this wasn't working üòä \n\nAll of this makes sense, as the dir seems relative to root. That's where I executed the upgrade script from, because I am having multiple tailwind related apps/packages. But the result does not take in consideration where the actual tailwind config was, so that it can figure out the appropriate location.\n\nI'm sorry if this is confusing or there's something else off, but it's pretty hard for me to reproduce the same issue again üòä \n\nThanks!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18603","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Content to source upgrade issue\" (#18603)"},{"Id":"3258821612","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-24T07:25:04","Actor":"shidfabics-netizen","Number":"18600","RawContent":null,"Title":"tzah","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

This can cause problems, as you can see in the example below:\n\nWe have a SvelteKit app.\n\nThis is the `vite.config.ts`:\n\n```ts\nimport { sveltekit } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite';\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite';\nimport tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [tailwindcss(), sveltekit()]\n});\n```\n\nIn our `app.css` we have some gradient stops for the primary color.\n\n```css\n@theme inline {\n  /* Common Tailwind gradient stops for primary color */\n  --color-primary-50: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 7%, hsl(193deg 100% 100%) 93%);\n  --color-primary-100: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 20%, hsl(193deg 100% 100%) 80%);\n  --color-primary-200: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 40%, hsl(193deg 100% 100%) 60%);\n  --color-primary-300: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 60%, hsl(193deg 100% 100%) 40%);\n  --color-primary-400: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 80%, hsl(193deg 100% 100%) 20%);\n  --color-primary-500: var(--primary);\n  --color-primary-600: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 90%, hsl(193deg 0% 0%) 10%);\n  --color-primary-700: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 78%, hsl(193deg 0% 0%) 22%);\n  --color-primary-800: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 65%, hsl(193deg 0% 0%) 35%);\n  --color-primary-900: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 50%, hsl(193deg 0% 0%) 50%);\n  --color-primary-950: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 35%, hsl(193deg 0% 0%) 65%);\n}\n```\n\nWith this we can use gradient stops for the primary color the same way as with the default Tailwind colors.\n\nWhen I use the class `border-primary-200`, I get this code in my dev environment:\n\n```css\n.border-primary-200 {\n    @supports (color: color-mix(in lab, red, red)) {\n        border-color: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 40%, hsl(193deg 100% 100%) 60%);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhich looks as expected:\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bae57fd-066e-4439-b1c2-8374879b4563)\n\nBut in the prod environment the `color-mix` doesn't work correctly anymore:\n\n```css\n@supports (color:color-mix(in lab,red,red)) {\n    .border-primary-200 {\n        border-color: color-mix(in hsl, var(--primary) 40%, #fff 60%);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAs you can see the border color for the box in the center looks different:\n\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd60d073-c92c-47cc-af42-26f3a9840a4f)\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18591","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Vite plugin converts HSL and RGB colors to HEX during build\" (#18591)"},{"Id":"3244021302","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-21T19:39:35","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"18571","RawContent":null,"Title":"Don‚Äôt output CSS objects with `false` or `undefined` in the AST","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography/issues/384\r\n\r\nBasically when addUtilities/addComponents/matchUtilities/matchComponents saw a value of `false` it was being output instead of being discarded like it was in v3.\r\n\r\nThe types really require these to be strings but for things like the typography plugin this isn't really carried through from its theme config so it was easy to put anything in there and not realize it doesn't match the expected types.\r\n\r\nBasically this:\r\n```js\r\naddUtilities({\r\n  '.foo': {\r\n    a: 'red',\r\n    'z-index': 0,\r\n    '.bar': false,\r\n    '.baz': null, // this one already worked\r\n    '.qux': undefined,\r\n  },\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow works like it did in v3 and omits `.bar`, `.baz`, and `.qux`","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/18571","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Don‚Äôt output CSS objects with `false` or `undefined` in the AST\" (#18571)"},{"Id":"3249055706","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-21T16:54:52","Actor":"jacobfriedman","Number":"18582","RawContent":null,"Title":"Z-index is inaccurate","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

For context, i am working on a component library using the new vite tailwind plugin.\n\nIf you export tailwind 4 css into a tailwind 3 project (even with prefix) it throws due to: `@layer base is used but no matching @tailwind base directive is present.`. \n\nThe recommended workaround is to rename the layers as detailed [here](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/18123#discussioncomment-13245038).\n\nIn my case this looks like this:\n\n```css\n@layer swt-theme, swt-base, swt-components, swt-utilities;\n@import \"tailwindcss/theme.css\" layer(swt-theme) prefix(swt);\n@import \"tailwindcss/preflight.css\" layer(swt-base) prefix(swt);\n@import \"tailwindcss/utilities.css\" layer(swt-utilities) prefix(swt);\n\n@plugin \"daisyui\" {\n    themes: all;\n}\n```\n\nIn addition to tailwind i use daisyui 5 (compatible with tailwind 4). Because of the daisyui plugin, the final .css file still contains references to `@layer base` resulting in `@layer base is used but no matching @tailwind base directive is present`.\n\nI reported this as [issue](https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui/issues/3937) with a [tailwind play link](https://play.tailwindcss.com/z19vEIqURl?file=css), but it seems that this issue cannot be adressed by the author of daisyui. \n\nI quote:\n> I understand.\n> Unfortunately, it's not possible yet to use another layer name due to Tailwind CSS plugin API.\n> Tailwind CSS provides APIs like addBase, addComponents, addUtilities\n> addBase always adds styles to Tailwind's predefined @layer base and addComponents, addUtilities always add styles to Tailwind's predefined @layer utilities.\n>\n> If Tailwind provides more access regarding this behavior, we may be able to provide an option as well.\n\nI hope that you can provide a way for plugin provider to either customize layer names or to correctly propagate any name changes in the tailwind config to the plugins.\n\nThis issue currently forces me to update the css file by hand before publishing, so it is really annoying üòÖ \n\nThanks for your time, reading this!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18558","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enable plugins to rename layer names\" (#18558)"},{"Id":"3234197609","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-16T14:20:14","Actor":"askdevai-bot","Number":"18549","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Add comprehensive LLM-friendly API reference","State":"closed","Body":"## Summary\n\nThis PR adds a comprehensive LLM-friendly API reference document (`LLM.md`) to the TailwindCSS repository.

I think it was still not reading darkMode setting from tailwind.config.js.\n```\n\"tailwind\": \"tailwindcss -i ./assets/css/tailwind.css --config $PWD/tailwind.config.js --content './layouts/**/*.html,./content/**/*.md' --minify > static/css/output.css\"\n```\n\n**Expected**:\nClass-based dark mode utilities (e.g., .dark\\:bg-gray-800) are generated, and toggling the dark class on <html> enables dark mode.\n\n**Actual**:\nOnly media-query-based dark utilities are generated (inside @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { ... }).\nToggling the dark class has no effect.\nDowngrading to Tailwind v3 (e.g., 3.4.3) with the same config and CLI command works perfectly and generates class-based dark utilities.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\nUse the config and CLI command above in a Hugo project.\nInspect the generated CSS for .dark\\:bg-gray-800 or similar class-based selectors.\nObserve that only media-query-based dark utilities are present.\n\n**Environment:**\n- Tailwind CSS v4.1.11\n- Node.js v23.5.0\n- macOS \n- Hugo v0.148.1\n\n**Repo/Minimal** (package.json):\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"modern\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"tailwind\": \"tailwindcss -i ./assets/css/tailwind.css --config $PWD/tailwind.config.js --content './layouts/**/*.html,./content/**/*.md' --minify -o static/css/output.css\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@tailwindcss/cli\": \"^4.1.11\",\n    \"@tailwindcss/typography\": \"^0.5.9\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.21\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8.5.6\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.3\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"browserslist\": \"^4.25.1\",\n    \"caniuse-lite\": \"^1.0.30001727\",\n    \"electron-to-chromium\": \"^1.5.182\",\n    \"escalade\": \"^3.2.0\",\n    \"fraction.js\": \"^4.3.7\",\n    \"nanoid\": \"^3.3.11\",\n    \"node-releases\": \"^2.0.19\",\n    \"normalize-range\": \"^0.1.2\",\n    \"picocolors\": \"^1.1.1\",\n    \"postcss-value-parser\": \"^4.2.0\",\n    \"source-map-js\": \"^1.2.1\",\n    \"update-browserslist-db\": \"^1.1.3\"\n  },\n  \"description\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\nUsing the -o flag, absolute config path, and all recommended CLI options does not resolve the issue.\nThis breaks all class-based dark mode toggling for Hugo and similar static site generators.\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18547","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"darkMode: 'class' not respected in Tailwind CSS v4 CLI with Hugo (class-based dark utilities not generated)\" (#18547)"},{"Id":"3231322680","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-15T14:14:58","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"18541","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update @tybys/wasm-util 0.9.0 ‚Üí 0.10.0 (major)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this upgrade.

It loads an `index.css` file from the Tailwind `node_modules` folder, as well as my own custom `root.css` file, which includes `@import 'tailwindcss'`. My CSS file includes the correct dark mode declarations, but the `index.css` file does not, which mixes up the declarations if you choose a color mode that is not the current `prefers-color-scheme`.\n\n<img width=\"1922\" height=\"940\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf04da75-2b34-4a8c-ab87-30577539a51e\" />\n\nSo I ended up with two versions of Tailwind  v4.1.11, each with CSS declarations that contradict each other.\n\n<img width=\"1682\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7600609-fa18-4a8a-885e-ec417c7669b2\" />\n\nI have already tried various methods of debugging and fixing it, but with no success.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18539","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Problem with dark mode because Tailwind v4 loads two CSS versions in dev mode\" (#18539)"},{"Id":"3229150681","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-14T15:59:51","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"18535","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update @emnapi/core 1.4.3 ‚Üí 1.4.4 (patch)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

This means that you should be able to use `_` instead of a space.

We would like to package multiple npm modules that contain custom components. The structure is as follows:\r\n`packages/\r\n   - package1/\r\n   - package2/\r\n`\r\n\r\nIdeally every package has it's own .SCSS that imports tailwind and allows to use @apply for custom styles when needed. \r\n\r\nHere is the issue:\r\nIf we use components of package1 in package2 tailwind seems to overwrite itself, e.g. inspecting via chrome console will show the styles breakdown and will show the styles of taikwind twice indicating its imported once via package1 and once via package2. \r\nAlso importing components can have weird side effects. E.g. Using components within package1 are all fine, but using components of package1 in package2 will suddenly break simple styles as ‚Äúalign-center‚Äù just flat out ignoring it. This leads to overwriting styles with important !  However this is obviously far from ideal. \r\n\r\nSorry for not posting more details, happy to supply some configs, if needed, but I am guessing there is something falsely configured for importing / exporting tailwind in the packages.

But since the stable engine doesn't have any idea what `@tailwindcss/oxide` even is, it crashes.\r\n\r\nIf you would inspect the generated code, then it will look something like this:\r\n```js\r\nimport moduleName from '@tailwindcss/oxide'\r\n\r\nif (env.OXIDE) {\r\n  moduleName.doSomethingOxideSpecific()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n... which kind of defeats the whole purpose of the feature flag in the first place. In a project where `OXIDE` is defined this all works fine, but in other places it won't.\r\n\r\nThis PR will switch the **runtime** feature flag, to a **build time** feature flag. This will ensure that the code is not even there in the final built code but that should be fine since you can switch between the engines if you install a different version (`insiders` vs `oxide-insiders`).\r\n\r\nWe will replace `__OXIDE__` at build time. This also means that some parts of the code will now look something like `if (false) { require('@tailwindcss/oxide') }`. This means that the block will never be reachable, but luckily SWCs optimizer will get rid of the dead code entirely.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nüëã Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

The following screenshot  shows that not only is the definition missing, but it's also referencing `from-position` rather than `to-position` for the `to-color`\r\n\r\n<img width=\"418\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4250423/231343342-468dd81a-02b8-4ade-95c1-d70096c02f18.png\" />","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/10989","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Unexpected gradient-stop behavior across light and dark modes\" (#10989)"},{"Id":"1666688001","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-13T20:12:12","Actor":"matei-s","Number":"11002","RawContent":null,"Title":"fixed gradient stop for default transparent","State":"closed","Body":"Fixed a typo causing the gradient stop position to be ignored when using the implicit transparent color.\r\n\r\nFixes #10989.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/11002","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fixed gradient stop for default transparent\" (#11002)"},{"Id":"1665645658","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-13T13:32:16","Actor":"christianmagill","Number":"10998","RawContent":null,"Title":"CDN Not Available for 3.3.1","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\n3.3.1\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\nWinden with Tailwind CDN for Development\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\n\r\nArc\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\n\r\nmacOS\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\n\r\nhttps://cdn.tailwindcss.com/3.3.1\r\n\r\n**Describe your issue**\r\n\r\nCDN is not available for version 3.3.1","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/10998","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"CDN Not Available for 3.3.1\" (#10998)"},{"Id":"1666191277","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-13T11:31:50","Actor":"vjdevra","Number":"11000","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update colors.js","State":"closed","Body":"Changing shade 50 of zinc color to '#fafafb' which will be different from shade 50 of neutral color.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nüëã Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

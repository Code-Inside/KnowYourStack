The implementation was also wrong as it always set alpha to the specific percent instead of applying it additively (note that this can be fixed with `calc(alpha * opacity)` though).\r\n\r\nInstead we decided to fix this by adding a `@supports` query to Preflight that only targets browsers that aren't affected by the crash. We currently use the following workaround:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/*\r\n  Set the default placeholder color to a semi-transparent version of the current text color in browsers that do not\r\n  crash when using `color-mix(‚Ä¶)` with `currentColor`. (https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17194)\r\n*/\r\n\r\n@supports (not (-webkit-appearance: -apple-pay-button)) /* Not Safari */ or\r\n  (contain-intrinsic-size: 1px) /* Safari 17+ */ {\r\n  ::placeholder {\r\n    color: color-mix(in oklab, currentColor 50%, transparent);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\nWhen testing the `color-mix(currentColor)` vs `oklab(from currentColor ‚Ä¶)` we created the following support matrix. I'm extending it with _our fix_ which is the fix ended up using:\r\n\r\n| Browser | Version | `color-mix(‚Ä¶ currentColor ‚Ä¶)` | `oklab(from currentColor ‚Ä¶)` | `@supports { color-mix(‚Ä¶) }` |\r\n| ------- | ------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------- |\r\n| Chrome  | 111     | ‚ùå                            | ‚ùå                           | ‚ùå      |\r\n| Chrome  | 116     | ‚úÖ                            | ‚ùå                           | ‚úÖ      |\r\n| Chrome  | 131+    | ‚úÖ                            | ‚úÖ                           | ‚úÖ      |\r\n| Safari  | 16.4    | üí•                            | ‚ùå                           | ‚ùå       |\r\n| Safari  | 16.6+   | ‚úÖ                            | ‚ùå                           | ‚ùå        |\r\n| Safari  | 18+     | ‚úÖ                            | ‚úÖ                           | ‚úÖ      |\r\n| Firefox | 128     | ‚úÖ                            | ‚ùå                           | ‚úÖ      |\r\n| Firefox | 133     | ‚úÖ                            | ‚úÖ                           | ‚úÖ      |\r\n\r\nNote that on Safari 16, this change makes it so that the browser does not crash yet it still won't work either. That's because now the browser will fall back to the default placeholder color instead.

This causes PostCSS to crash, preventing it from tracking the files Tailwind processes. As a result, these files aren't added to the file watcher / dependency tree, leading to issues where cached compilation results aren't invalidated when a file changes, since it isn't recognized as a transitive dependency._\n\nI opened discussion here, too:\n\n[https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/17077](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/17077)","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17295","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Angular 19 cannot automatically recover using @apply with Tailwind CSS 4\" (#17295)"},{"Id":"2931943042","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-19T18:43:51","Actor":"charlieforward9","Number":"17289","RawContent":null,"Title":"Upgrade tool fails with unactionable error message","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

The first one uses Tailwind CSS v3. To test it, open the project, install dependencies with npm install, start the project with npm start, and navigate to http://localhost:9000/. You can toggle the width of the square using the button.\n\nI have also included a version using Tailwind CSS v4. Follow the same steps to start it. However, in this version, the size toggle no longer works because the w-[44px] class doesn‚Äôt seem to be generated.\n\nIf you add a div with this class, for example:\n\n```\n<div class=\"size-[144px] flex items-center justify-center mt-10 bg-yellow-500 rounded p-5\">This works</div>\n```\n\nboth the new div and the toggled element receive the correct height. Since I frequently use `size-[44px].class=\"size === 'small'\"`style bindings in my projects, I need this functionality to work properly.\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17290","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Arbitrary value classes not generated with Aurelia 2 style class bindings.\" (#17290)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-03-24T03:30:22.7973164Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":450}

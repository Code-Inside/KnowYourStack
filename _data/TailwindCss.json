Yet, as tailwind reaches almost 3M downloads per week (https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss), this behaviour may have a significant impact. Of course, it's up to Safari developers to fix this on their side if they're willing to. Meanwhile, an alternative to default styles for lists should be provided, or at least something in the docs to notify tailwind users about this issue. \r\n\r\nOne hack to restore semantics when `list-style: none` is applied : https://gerardkcohen.me/writing/2017/voiceover-list-style-type.html","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/8975","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"A11y issue : semantics on Lists being removed with Safari as list-style: none is a default.\" (#8975)"},{"Id":"1319222452","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-27T16:19:09","Actor":"Semdevmaster","Number":"8966","RawContent":null,"Title":"Incorrect work of url() in css file when using vite.js","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

For example, the component `.container` points back to the `@tailwind components` at-rule.\r\n\r\nWe would do this unconditionally for all generated output by Tailwind CSS. Since `@layer components` and `@layer utilities` in CSS register custom utilities, the source maps for these could be lost when the files containing the `@layer` and `@tailwind` directives were different. This happens when using postcss-import for example:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/* Source is: \"node_modules/tailwindcss/components.css\" */\r\n@import \"tailwindcss/components\";\r\n\r\n/* Source is: \"input.css\" */\r\n@layer components {\r\n  .test {\r\n    color: red;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of this we would throw away the original source information and it appeared, to later tools, that the original source map was just `@tailwind components` from the `components.css` file instead of having sources from `components.css` AND from `input.css`. This in turn broke Vite's url-rewriting because it relies on the original source map input.\r\n\r\nCuriously, with postcss-import, this problem doesn't appear for local CSS file imports. Only imports coming from `node_modules` (unless I did something wrong 🙃 ). I would have expected it to rewrite the rules from inside the CSS file to point to the `@import` but perhaps it treats node_modules stuff differently.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this PR fixes the source maps so that rules generated from `@layer` point back to the original source.\r\n\r\nFixes #8966","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/8971","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Don't rewrite source maps for `@layer` rules\" (#8971)"},{"Id":"1319528476","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-27T13:01:57","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"8969","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update jest: 28.1.2 → 28.1.3 (patch)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

The [CSS spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-ui-3/#valdef-cursor-pointer) establishes that `cursor: pointer` indicates an element is a link.\r\n\r\n[This article](https://medium.com/simple-human/buttons-shouldnt-have-a-hand-cursor-b11e99ca374b) has some additional justification for this.

Before you submit, please read the following:\r\n\r\nSearch open/closed issues before submitting since someone might have asked the same thing before!\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# 🐛 bug report: \r\n\r\nAuto-reload is not triggered upon making a change to HTML or adding Tailwind classes (unless AlpineJS script is commented out)\r\n\r\n<!--- Provide a general summary of the issue here -->\r\n\r\nPage doesn't auto-reload after applying changes to HTML or when adding Tailwind classes. I have to reload manually to get the changes to apply.

However, if I uncomment the AlpineJS CDN, it works just fine.\r\n\r\n## 💁 Possible Solution\r\n\r\n<!--- Not obligatory, but suggest a fix/reason for the bug -->\r\n\r\nCommenting out the AlpineJS script makes the file work, but then this defeats the purpose of being able to quickly build with both AlpineJS and TailwindCSS, given that I'll have to comment and then uncomment the CDN each time I'll be adding new methods, etc.\r\n\r\n## 🔦 Context\r\n\r\n<!--- How has this issue affected you?

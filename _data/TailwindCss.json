The repo currently has 2 workspaces: `app` for the React app, and `preset` which exports a Tailwind preset with themes and a plugin.\r\n\r\nThe (abridged) project layout:\r\n\r\n```\r\n├── package.json\r\n├── app\r\n│   ├── package.json\r\n│   ├── postcss.config.js\r\n│   ├── tailwind.config.js\r\n│   └── vite.config.ts\r\n└── preset\r\n    ├── package.json\r\n    └── src\r\n        └── index.ts\r\n```\r\n\r\n`app/tailwind.config.js`\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport preset from \"preset\";\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  content: [\"./index.html\", \"./src/**/*.{html,js,jsx,ts,tsx}\"],\r\n  presets: [preset],\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I run `vite` in dev mode, Vite server sets up \"hot module reload\" which enables automatically reloading the page on file changes.\r\n\r\nWhen I change `tailwind.config.js`, Vite HMR is able to reprocess CSS and automatically update styles. When I update styles in the `preset` workspace, Vite does not reprocess CSS, and styles are not updated, even after manually refreshing the page. The only way to force Vite to reprocess CSS is to restart the Vite server.\r\n\r\n**Intuition**\r\n\r\nIt could be that `scanDir` used [here](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/5e737d858755a7149e17b5f3feaeb0d42865354d/packages/%40tailwindcss-postcss/src/index.ts#L106-L107) is unable to scan directories outside of `base`, which doesn't let it [report those files as `dependency`](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/5e737d858755a7149e17b5f3feaeb0d42865354d/packages/%40tailwindcss-postcss/src/index.ts#L109-L130) (or `dir-dependency`) to Vite. If I manage to setup a development environment, I will test that theory and report back.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13663","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"PostCSS plugin not processing changes outside base directory\" (#13663)"},{"Id":"2286556344","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-08T22:02:42","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"13661","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add `nth-*` variants","State":"open","Body":"This adds variants for the `:nth-child()`, `:nth-last-child()`, `:nth-of-type()`, and `:nth-last-of-type()` pseudo classes.

However, they can _also_ use CSS custom properties that point to another dashed ident.\n\nE.g.:\n\n```css\n.foo {\n  --target: --sidebar;\n  anchor-name: var(--target);\n}\n```\n\nA workaround that some people used is adding a `_` in front of the variable: `mt-[_--my-thing]` this way we don't automatically inject the `var(…)` around it. This is a workaround and gross.\n\nWhile the idea of automatic var injection is neat, this causes more trouble than it's worth. Adding `var(…)` explicitly is better.\n\nA side effect of this is that we can simplify the internals for the `candidate` data structure because we don't need to track `dashedIdent` separately anymore.\n\n\n<!--\n\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

attn @adamwathan @RobinMalfait\r\n\r\nThis issue delves into some of the issues surrounding why the parser doesn't properly handle `supports-[content:\"(\"]:grid`, first explored in #13596. This specific case turned out to be quite the rabbit hole.\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, Tailwind's Rust parser runs into issues related to its `quote_stack` and `bracket_stack` when encountering a construct like `'('`.\r\n\r\nNone of these process correctly, apparently for this same reason:\r\n* `supports-[content:'(']`\r\n* `supports-[content:'[']`\r\n* `supports-[content:'\"']`\r\n* `supports-[content:\"'\"]`\r\n\r\nThis Tailwind Play example demonstrates the issue I'm describing: https://play.tailwindcss.com/EAhSfQFfTa\r\n\r\nI can think of a few potential solutions, all of which come with trade-offs:\r\n\r\n1. We could interpret everything after an open quote as a string until we hit the closing quote. This would break some things, but we'd be able to handle brackets or quotes within strings.\r\n\r\n2. We could always ignore `bracket_stack` characters within `quote_stack` characters, but not ignore `quote_stack` characters within `bracket_stack` characters.\r\n\r\n3. Specifically enforce escaping characters related to `quote_stack` and `bracket_stack` when they're in a string context. This would mean that `supports-[content:\"(\"]` would need to be written as `supports-[content:\"\\(\"]` to work.\r\n\r\n   * `supports-[content:'(']` -> `supports-[content:'\\(']`\r\n   * `supports-[content:'[']` -> `supports-[content:'\\[']`\r\n   * `supports-[content:'\"']` -> `supports-[content:'\\\"']`\r\n   * `supports-[content:\\\"'\\\"]` -> `supports-[content:\\\"\\'\\\"]`\r\n   ☝🏼 this last one might be problematic for more reasons than one, related to escaping the same quotes used when opening the `class` attribute as well as escaping the inner `quote_stack` character\r\n\r\n4. We could strictly enforce escaping special characters like these in string contexts.\r\n\r\n   This might be most consistent and with common escape patterns, but it would also be one of the most disruptive solutions.\r\n   \r\n   In the case of my Multi plugin, for example, I was surprised—when chatting with @RobinMalfait ([see discussion](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13473#issuecomment-2059785107))—to discover that nesting quotes in arbitrary values is not only supported but that they appear to be infinitely nestable.\r\n   \r\n   In other words, this works:\r\n   \r\n   ```\r\n   multi-['multi-['multi-['font-bold']'];text-green-700;before:content-['$']']\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   If escapes were required to resolve this issue, each level of nesting might require a greater level of escape characters, which could get out of hand quickly. For example, the above would need to be written like this:\r\n   \r\n   ```\r\n   multi-['multi-[\\'multi-[\\\\\\'font-bold\\\\\\']\\'];text-green-700;before:content-[\\'$\\']']\r\n   ```\r\n   \r\n   Of course, it would be convenient for me not to need to update my plugin(s) with new syntax and safety measures again, and such escaping would probably render my plugin too cumbersome to justify using. However, greater parity with CSS is probably a higher and more evergreen standard here.\r\n   \r\n   Simply wrapping the arbitrary value in quotes was an easy fix, but the magic around it allowing nested quotes may be the culprit behind `\"(\"` not working, to some degree.\r\n   \r\n   <table><tr><td>\r\n   \r\n   [![conversation between Brandon McConnell and Robin Malfait about the nature of quoted strings in Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/assets/5913254/21074661-d6ae-43b5-9fc4-42eaec21ef1d)](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13473#issuecomment-2059785107)\r\n   \r\n   </td></tr></table>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm new to Rust, so all of this is \"to the best of my current knowledge\" from what I could grok reading through the parser. I also consulted a colleague who is more experienced with Rust to corroborate my findings and theories, and they came to roughly the same conclusions.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13607","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"v4: Bug with how the parser handles nested `quote_stack` and `bracket_stack` characters when in a string context\" (#13607)"},{"Id":"2268893871","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-30T16:22:11","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"13608","RawContent":null,"Title":"Ensure strings are consumed as-is when using internal `segment()`","State":"closed","Body":"This PR fixes an issue where parens, bracket and curlies needed to be balanced inside of strings instead of consuming the string until the end.\n\nWhen encountering strings when using `segment` we didn't really treat them as actual strings. This means that if you used any parens, brackets, or curlies then we wanted them to be properly balanced.\n\nThis should not be the case, whenever we encounter a string, we want to consume it as-is and don't want to worry about bracket balancing. We will now consume it until the end of the string (and make sure that escaped closing quotes are not seen as real closing quotes).\n\nFixes: #13607\n\n<!--\n\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

either and likely requires a slight change to the parser to account for consuming chars in quoted strings in arbitrary values as-is, including special chars.\r\n\r\nTesting `supports-[content:\"(\"]` against `supports-[content:\"test\"]` confirmed the parenthesis as the problematic character, as expected, so that should be a relatively simple fix.\r\n\r\nAs that effort does not appear directly related to issue #13594, I prefer to handle that one in a separate PR, and I do intend to take my best shot at it so that I can get a bit less rusty at rust

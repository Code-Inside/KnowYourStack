to them properly.

So the content section of tailwind.config.js looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  content: [\r\n      \"./wwwroot/index.html\"\r\n  ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nI run a tailwind CLI watcher with a command like this:\r\n```\r\nnpx tailwindcss --output wwwroot/css/tailwind.css --watch -i css/twbase.css\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am suffering from the problem described in #7759 where the watcher stops watching after a while - anywhere between almost immediately and after lots and lots of successful rebuilds.\r\n\r\nBy using the \"Process Monitor\" utility to observe the filesystem activity on the index.html file, I have observed that when Visual Studio (devenv.exe) is saving index.html, it goes through a rename/replace process which means there is a window of time in which the index.html file does not actually exist.   It appears that node.exe (i.e. Tailwind) sometimes tries to read the file during this window and finds it to be missing.    \r\n\r\nThis apparently causes Tailwind to stop watching that file.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1306085/183951128-98b84dcd-166f-4d9d-b97f-6f98b9275266.png)\r\n\r\nThe blue selected line in the image is Node getting a file-not-found failure doing a CreateFile (it's actually an open-to-read) on index.html in the middle of devenv doing a rename dance.  I think that's a smoking gun.\r\n\r\nIf I change the content file specification to be a wildcard, then my first impression is that things are much more robust:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  content: [\r\n      \"./wwwroot/*.html\"\r\n  ],\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n\r\n1. Is it possible/likely that TW is converting a transient read-failure on a watched file into a permanent failure to watch that file?\r\n2. If so, could this be fixed?   \r\n \r\nEven without the specific Visual Studio rename thing, transient read failures are probably an inescapable feature of Windows, because it's so common that people have tools like anti-virus and cloud-backup and indexers which do lots of automatic file opening.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/9072","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Transient read failure may cause permanent failure to watch file\" (#9072)"},{"Id":"1334311323","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-08-10T14:36:05","Actor":"dcastil","Number":"9066","RawContent":null,"Title":"Not possible to set ring color with `future.respectDefaultRingColorOpacity` enabled","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

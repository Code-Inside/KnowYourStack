`package.json` to add:\n```json\n  \"overrides\": {\n    \"rollup\": \"npm:@rollup/wasm-node\"\n  }\n```\nThen starting the development server with\n```sh\n% npm install\n% npm run dev\n```\nAnd

by following the instructions of <https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite>\n\n```sh\n% npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite\n```\n\nThen we edit `vite.config.js` to make

finally running with `` and trying to open http://localhost:\n```sh\n% npm run dev\n```\n\nwill produce the error:\n```\nfailed to load config from

The definition of \"used\" in this case is:\r\n\r\n1. Used in your CSS  file(s) â€” (we check the final CSS AST for this)\r\n2. Used _somewhere_ in any of your source files (e.g.: a JavaScript file accessing a variable)\r\n\r\nThe issue this PR tries to solve is with the very first point. If you are using CSS modules, then every CSS file is processed separately. This is not a choice Tailwind CSS made, but how other build tooling works (like Vite for example).\r\n\r\nTo prevent emitting all of Tailwind's Preflight reset and all utilities per CSS file, you can use the `@reference` directive instead of repeating `@import \"tailwindcss\";`. This is explained here: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/compatibility#explicit-context-sharing \r\n\r\nBut now we are just _referencing_ them, not emitting them. And since the CSS module is not connected in any way to the main `index.css` file that contains the `@import \"tailwindcss\";` directive, we don't even see the CSS variables while processing the `index.css` file. (or wherever your main CSS file is)\r\n\r\nThis is where point 2 from above comes in. This is a situation where we rely on the extractor to find the used CSS variables so we can internally mark them as used.\r\n\r\nTo finally get to the point of this PR, the extractor only scans `.html`, `.js`, ... files but not `.css` files. So all the CSS variables used inside of CSS modules will not be generated.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes that behavior to also scan `.css` files. But _only_ for CSS variables (not any other type of class candidate). This is important, otherwise all your custom `@utility foo {}` definitions would always mark `foo` as a used class and include it in the CSS which is not always the case.\r\n\r\nOn top extracting CSS variables, we will also make sure that the CSS variables we find are in usage positions (e.g.: `var(--color-red-500)`) and not in definition positions (e.g.: `--color-red-500: #ff0000;`). This is important because we only want to emit the variables that are actually used in the final CSS output.\r\n\r\nOne future improvement not implemented here, is that technically we will also extract CSS variables that might not be used if defined in a `@utility`.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@utility never-used {\r\n  color: var(--color-red-500); /* --color-red-500 will be emitted, even if it might not be used */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes: #16904\r\nFixes: #17429\r\n\r\n# Test plan\r\n\r\n1.

Fortunatnyl for us, this does not apply to `@property` rules which we've been using before to initialize CSS variables.\r\n\r\nHowever, since we're now bringing back the `@property` polyfills, that would cause unexpected rules to be exported from the CSS file as this:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n@reference \"tailwindcss\";\r\n\r\n.skew {\r\n  @apply skew-7;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould turn to the following file:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.skew {\r\n  /* â€¦ */\r\n}\r\n@supports (/*â€¦*/) {\r\n  @layer base {\r\n    *, :before, :after, ::backdrop {\r\n      --tw-gradient-position: initial;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n@property /* â€¦ */ \r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that this adds a `*` selector which is not considered pure.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there is no way for us to silence this warning or work around it, as the dependency causing this errors ([`postcss-modules-local-by-default`](https://github.com/css-modules/postcss-modules-local-by-default)) is bundled into Next.js. To work around crashes, these polyfills will not apply to CSS modules processed by the PostCSS extension for now.\r\n\r\n## Testing on tailwindcss.com\r\n\r\nTo see the changes in effect, take a look at this screencast that compares tailwindcss.com on iOS 15.5 with a version that has the patches of this PR applied:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1279d6f5-3c63-4f30-839c-198a789f4292\r\n\r\n## Open questions\r\n\r\n- [ ] Should we make the `@property` polyfill not require an `@layer base` and instead place the generated CSS on the top of the file?\r\n- [ ] Add fallbacks for newly introduced usages of the relative color syntax.\r\n- [ ] Figure out how we actually implement the `@media` range query workarounds\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\n- [x] Tested on tailwindcss.com via a preview build: https://tailwindcss-com-git-legacy-browsers-tailwindlabs.vercel.app/\r\n- [x] Updated tests\r\n- [ ] Ensure we test on Chrome 111, Safari 16.4, Firefox 128 to make sure we have no regressions\r\n\r\n ","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/17435","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Improve compatibility with Safari 15\" (#17435)"},{"Id":"2956567458","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-28T16:40:57","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"17432","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add `bg-{position,size}-*` utilities","State":"closed","Body":"This PR adds `bg-{position,size}-*` utilities that support arbitrary values.

But when building the order of the plugins is not respected, causing issues and even a build error in the case of postcss-mixin. I get the same then not using the Vite config but a postcss config file. I would expect the dev and build would produce the same results and since Tailwind 4 is just a postcss plugin it would respect the plugin order.\n\n### Env\n```\nSystem:\n    OS: macOS 15.3\n    CPU: (12) arm64 Apple M2 Max\n    Memory: 141.72 MB / 32.00 GB\n    Shell: 5.9 - /bin/zsh\n  Binaries:\n    Node: 23.10.0 - /opt/homebrew/bin/node\n    npm: 10.9.2 - /opt/homebrew/bin/npm\n  Browsers:\n    Chrome: 134.0.6998.89\n    Safari: 18.3\n  npmPackages:\n    @tailwindcss/postcss:  4.0.17\n    postcss-mixins: 11.0.3\n    postcss-nested\": 7.0.2\n    vite: 6.2.3\n```\n\n### Issue project repo\n[https://github.com/WouterDeGeringel/tailwind4-postcss-plugins-issue-on-build](https://github.com/WouterDeGeringel/tailwind4-postcss-plugins-issue-on-build)\n\n### Reproduction steps\n- run: npm install\n- run: npm run dev\n- Everthing works fine (hover on \"X\" will turn it red\n- run: npm run build\n- You'll see an error (error during build: ...

One specific class with 3 modifiers (`file:disabled:dark:bg-green-500`) generates some invalid CSS which in turn crashes the entire page with `STATUS_BREAKPOINT`, this happened to me on both Chrome and WebView2 on Windows. I have `@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *));` in my css file, I copied a similar variant from [tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode#toggling-dark-mode-manually:~:text=%40custom%2Dvariant%20dark%20(%26%3Awhere(.dark%2C%20.dark%20*))%3B) and used it in the playground with the same error occurring. Removing the custom variant generates `@media` modifiers instead and fixes the issue.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25a5fb70-abef-4488-8692-f44e943c8ce8)","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/17402","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Invalid CSS causes entire page to crash with STATUS_BREAKPOINT\" (#17402)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-03-31T03:30:22.1960783Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":463}

This occurs because Heroku installs gems inside the project directory (`vendor/bundle`), which Tailwind then scans, encountering patterns like `{method}[rdoc-ref:Target#method!]` that contain `!` characters invalid as CSS tokens.\n\n## Environment\n\n- **Tailwind CSS**: v4 (via tailwindcss-rails 4.4.0)\n- **Ruby on Rails**: 8.1.1\n- **Platform**: Heroku (Ruby buildpack)\n- **Deployment**: Heroku uses `bundle install --path vendor/bundle --deployment`\n\n## Reproduction\n\n### Why it happens on Heroku but not locally:\n\n1. **Heroku**: Installs gems to `./vendor/bundle/ruby/3.4.0/gems/` (inside project)\n2. **Local**: Installs gems to system location like `~/.rbenv/versions/3.4.7/lib/ruby/gems/` (outside project)\n3. **Tailwind v4**: With `@import \"tailwindcss\";` and no explicit `@source` directives, recursively scans the current working directory\n4. **On Heroku**: Tailwind finds and scans vendor/bundle, including Rails framework source files\n5. **Locally**: Tailwind never sees gem files because they're outside the project directory\n\n### Specific warnings:\n\n```\nUnexpected token Delim(\"!\") at 1:14 in {*_will_change!}[rdoc-ref: #* will_change!]\n  Location: vendor/bundle/ruby/3.4.0/gems/activemodel-8.1.1/lib/active_model/dirty.rb:111\n\nUnexpected token Delim(\"!\") at 1:14 in {destroy!}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#destroy!]\n  Location: vendor/bundle/ruby/3.4.0/gems/activerecord-8.1.1/lib/active_record/errors.rb:169\n\nUnexpected token Delim(\"!\") at 1:14 in {save!}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#save!]\n  Location: vendor/bundle/ruby/3.4.0/gems/activerecord-8.1.1/lib/active_record/errors.rb:147 (+ 5 other files)\n\nUnexpected token Delim(\"!\") at 1:14 in {update_attribute!}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#update_attribute!]\n  Location: vendor/bundle/ruby/3.4.0/gems/activerecord-8.1.1/lib/active_record/errors.rb:148\n```\n\n### Example source code triggering warnings:\n\n```ruby\n# From activerecord-8.1.1/lib/active_record/errors.rb:147\n# Rails uses RDoc cross-reference syntax in inline documentation:\n# {ActiveRecord::Base#save!}[rdoc-ref:Persistence#save!]\n```\n\nThe `!` character is valid in Ruby method names but invalid as a CSS token.\n\n## Impact\n\n- ✅ Deployment succeeds\n- ✅ CSS builds correctly\n- ✅ Application functions normally\n- ⚠️ Build logs show 4 cosmetic warnings\n- ⚠️ No way to suppress warnings without modifying Rails framework source\n\n## Research Completed\n\nWe conducted comprehensive research and found:\n- ❌ No existing GitHub issues documenting this interaction\n- ❌ No Tailwind v4 CLI flags to suppress specific warnings\n- ❌ No way to exclude subdirectories in `vendor/` (Tailwind v4 removed v3 exclusion syntax)\n- ❌ `.gemrc` doesn't work (Bundler ignores it)\n- ❌ `@source` directives can't prevent scanning individual gem directories\n\n## Possible Solutions\n\n### 1. Add warning suppression options (Feature Request)\n\nAdd CLI flags or configuration to suppress warnings by:\n- File path patterns (e.g., `--suppress-warnings=\"vendor/**\"`)\n- Specific warning types (e.g., `--suppress=\"Unexpected token Delim\"`)\n\n### 2. Improve RDoc handling\n\nTailwind could recognize common documentation patterns like:\n- `{text}[rdoc-ref:Target]` (RDoc cross-references)\n- `{text}[rdoc-label:Label]` (RDoc labels)\n- And skip parsing them as CSS\n\n### 3. Better @source exclusion syntax\n\nRestore or enhance the ability to exclude paths from scanning:\n```css\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\n@source \"app/**\" exclude \"vendor/**\";\n```\n\n### 4. Documentation\n\nDocument this edge case and recommended workarounds for Rails developers deploying to Heroku.\n\n## Current Workaround\n\nAccept the warnings as cosmetic. They indicate Tailwind correctly identified patterns it cannot parse, but don't affect functionality.\n\n## Related Context\n\n- **RDoc syntax**: Standard Ruby documentation format used throughout Rails framework\n- **Heroku deployment**: Common platform for Rails applications\n- **Rails 8.1.1**: Current stable release of Ruby on Rails\n- **Tailwind v4**: Latest major version with new CSS-first architecture\n\nThis appears to be an undocumented edge case - a novel interaction between Rails framework documentation conventions, Heroku's gem installation strategy, and Tailwind v4's content scanning behavior.\n\n## Questions\n\n1. Is there already a way to exclude specific directories from scanning that we missed?\n2. Would you accept a PR adding warning suppression options?\n3. Should this be documented as a known limitation?\n\nThank you for considering this issue.

This, additionally, lets you have multiple config files for separate CSS entry points — oftentimes found in monorepos with multiple packages.\r\n\r\nThis means that you can now do this and it will look for the config file next to the CSS file:\r\n```css\r\n@config \"./tailwind.config.js\";\r\n@tailwind base;\r\n@tailwind components;\r\n@tailwind utilities;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis even works with `postcss-import` if you have a `@config` directive in an imported file. In which case the config will be relative to that imported CSS file. If you do not have an `@config` directive we will still use the config file specified by the postcss plugin for that CSS file.\r\n\r\n> **Warning**\r\n> This **does not** work the way you may expect with imports + preprocessors like Sass/LESS/etc… as those generally compile to one blob of CSS that's passed to PostCSS so it will likely be relative to the Sass entry file instead.\r\n\r\nFixes #6517","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/9405","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add `@config` support\" (#9405)"},{"Id":"1382773934","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-23T12:09:03","Actor":"thecrypticace","Number":"9396","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow resolving content paths relative to the config file","State":"closed","Body":"Right now we resolve content paths relative the the current working directory (\"CWD\"). If you run the CLI from a different location than the current working directory you can get unexpected results.\r\n\r\nAs an example, let's say that your config says that your content files live under `./src/pages/**/*.js` and `./src/components/**.js`. If you run Tailwind CSS using `npx tailwindcss build …` from _inside_ the `src/` directory then Tailwind will complain about not being able to find any content paths. This doesn't make much sense because, to the user, the content is relative to the \"project root\" — which is almost always where their config file is.\r\n\r\nSo, we've added an option `content.relative` that lets you specify this behavior explicitly:\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  content: {\r\n    relative: true,\r\n    files: [\r\n      \"./src/pages/**/*.js\",\r\n      \"./src/components/**/*.js\",\r\n    ],\r\n  },\r\n  // …\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n> **Note**\r\n> Setting `content.relative` to `true` ensures that your **non-absolute paths** are resolved relative to the config file. You can also explicitly say that you don't want this behavior by setting it to `false`.\r\n\r\nThis will let you run Tailwind CSS from anywhere and it will resolve the file paths relative the location of the config file. If you do NOT use a config file (because you're passing an object, because you're using Nuxt with it's Tailwind CSS plugin, or some other third party solution) then the paths are resolved relative to the current working directory.\r\n\r\nThis is a change we intend to make the **default behavior in the future** for v4 — as such we've added a flag `future.relativeContentPathsByDefault` that enables this behavior by default. This allows you to keep using the `array` syntax for content paths instead of needing the object:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  future: {\r\n    relativeContentPathsByDefault: true,\r\n  },\r\n  content: [\r\n    \"./src/pages/**/*.js\",\r\n    \"./src/components/**/*.js\",\r\n  ],\r\n  // …\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFixes #6516","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/9396","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Allow resolving content paths relative to the config file\" (#9396)"},{"Id":"1383426148","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-23T10:44:37","Actor":"jinalptl1993","Number":"9401","RawContent":null,"Title":"TailwindCSS production mode is not including any decimal classes like py-2.5, py-3.5","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

So we can basically just check the value is wrapped by css functions in `number`, `length`, and `percentage` https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/blob/b37a44a85d803ca353f299c1989c425874da9af5/src/util/dataTypes.js#L9\r\n\r\nSo we can now create some crazy stuff like\r\n```css\r\n/* bg-[rgb(11,22,33)] */\r\n.bg-\\[rgb\\(11\\2c 22\\2c 33\\)\\] {\r\n  --tw-bg-opacity: 1;\r\n  background-color: rgb(11 22 33 / var(--tw-bg-opacity))\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* bg-[linear-gradient(45deg,_red_0_50%,_blue_50%_100%)] */\r\n.bg-\\[linear-gradient\\(45deg\\2c _red_0_50\\%\\2c _blue_50\\%_100\\%\\)\\] {\r\n  background-image: linear-gradient(45deg, red 0 50%, blue 50% 100%)\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* bg-[auto_auto,cover,_contain,calc(10px_+_12%),max(20px,_10%)_10%] */\r\n.bg-\\[auto_auto\\2c cover\\2c _contain\\2c calc\\(10px_\\+_12\\%\\)\\2c max\\(20px\\2c _10\\%\\)_10\\%\\] {\r\n  background-size: auto auto,cover, contain,calc(10px + 12%),max(20px, 10%) 10%\r\n}\r\n```\r\ndiscussions: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/9351","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/9349","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Improve type checking for formal syntax\" (#9349)"},{"Id":"1375748903","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-16T10:29:03","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"9341","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update fast-glob: 3.2.11 → 3.2.12 (patch)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

This is useful when you define multiple background colors for example:\n```html\n<div class=\"bg-[rgb(0,0,0),rgb(255,255,255)]\"></div>\n```\n\nIn this case splitting by the regex would result in the proper result:\n```js\nlet result = [\n  'rgb(0,0,0)',\n  'rgb(255,255,255)'\n]\n```\n\nVisually, you can think of it like:\n```\n    ┌─[./example.html]\n    │\n∙ 1 │   <div class=\"bg-[rgb(0,0,0),rgb(255,255,255)]\"></div>\n    ·                       ──┬── ┬    ─────┬─────\n    ·                         │   │         ╰─────── Guarded by parens\n    ·                         │   ╰───────────────── We will split here\n    ·                         ╰───────────────────── Guarded by parens\n    │\n    └─\n```\n\nWe properly split by `,` not inside a `()`. However, this RegEx fails the moment you have deeply nested `,` values or an `(` is seen at the right of the current position. If you have the following example:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"bg-[rgba(0,0,0,var(--alpha))]\"></div>\n```\n\nVisually, this is what's happening:\n```\n    ┌─[./example.html]\n    │\n∙ 1 │   <div class=\"bg-[rgba(0,0,0,var(--alpha))]\"></div>\n    ·                         ┬ ┬ ┬\n    ·                         ╰─┴─┴── We accidentally split here\n    │\n    └─\n```\n\nThis is because on the right of the `,`, the first paren is an opening paren `(` instead of a closing one `)`.\n\nI'm not 100% sure how we can improve the RegEx to handle that case as well, instead I wrote a small `splitBy` function that allows you to split the string by a character (just like you could do before) but ignores the ones inside the given exceptions. This keeps track of a stack to know whether we are within parens or not.\n\nVisually, the fix looks like this:\n```\n    ┌─[./example.html]\n    │\n∙ 1 │   <div class=\"bg-[rgba(0,0,0,var(--alpha)),rgb(255,255,255,var(--alpha))]\"></div>\n    ·                         ┬ ┬ ┬             ┬       ┬   ┬   ┬\n    ·                         │ │ │             │       ╰───┴───┴── Guarded by parens\n    ·                         │ │ │             ╰────────────────── We will split here\n    ·                         ╰─┴─┴──────────────────────────────── Guarded by parens\n    │\n    └─\n```\n\n<!--\n\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

Applying multiple rotations in a sequence is order-dependent and can be done using an arbitrary `transform` value (e.g. `transform-[rotateX(45deg)_rotateY(-90deg)]`). \r\n\r\nCare has been taken to only apply transformations in the z-dimension when the relevant utilities are used. This should avoid triggering GPU rendering except when needed.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/13248","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"3D transform utilities\" (#13248)"},{"Id":"2195320801","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-19T15:40:08","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"13281","RawContent":null,"Title":"Prepare next release: `4.0.0-alpha.10`","State":"open","Body":"This PR prepares for the next alpha release: `4.0.0-alpha.10`\n\nRequires: #13248\n\n<!--\n\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

The CSS variables used in `transform`, `translate` and so forth are partially undefined in Firefox, rendering the entire rule without effect.\r\n\r\nIn the example above, the `<p>` should be translated by 2rem to the right, using `transform translate-x-8`. This works in Chrome and Safari as previously in < 4.0.0, because `translate-x-*` expands to two rules, one for setting `--tw-translate-x` and one for rendering\r\n\r\n```css\r\ntransform: translate(var(--tw-translate-x),var(--tw-translate-y)) rotate(var(--tw-rotate)) skewX(var(--tw-skew-x)) skewY(var(--tw-skew-y)) scaleX(var(--tw-scale-x)) scaleY(var(--tw-scale-y));\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the rest of the variables are defaulted from the preflight settings.\r\n\r\nIn v4, these are set via CSS's `@property` rules with appropriate defaults, but those at-rules are not yet supported in mainline Firefox. `translate-x-*` is also expanded into a singular rule, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.translate-x-8 {\r\n    --tw-translate-x: 3rem;\r\n    translate: var(--tw-translate-x) var(--tw-translate-y);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere the undefinedness of --tw-translate-y breaks the property's effect. You can quickly fix this by adding\r\n\r\n```css\r\n--tw-translate-x: 0;\r\n--tw-translate-y: 0;\r\n--tw-rotate: 0;\r\n--tw-skew-x: 0;\r\n--tw-skew-y: 0;\r\n--tw-scale-x: 1;\r\n--tw-scale-y: 1;\r\n```\r\n\r\nto your `@theme` block to default them at the root.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13268","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[v4] `transform` utilities not working in Firefox due to no support for `@property`\" (#13268)"},{"Id":"2190657699","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-17T13:00:43","Actor":"zoomoid","Number":"13267","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v4] `max-w-screen-*` utilities are not provided by default","State":"open","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\r\n\r\nv4.0.0-alpha.9\r\n\r\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\r\n\r\n@tailwindcss/postcss 4.0.0-alpha.9, Next.js 14.1.3\r\n\r\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\r\n\r\nv20.11.0\r\n\r\n**What browser are you using?**\r\n\r\nChrome, Firefox, Safari\r\n\r\n**What operating system are you using?**\r\n\r\nmacOS\r\n\r\n**Reproduction URL**\r\n\r\nClone the NextJS repo at <https://github.com/zoomoid/tailwindcss-4-experiments> and run the project in `missing-screen-widths`.

Now that full builds wait until the bundle stage, dev builds can simply run immediately. This might build Tailwind CSS twice, generating a FOUC (since the first build hasn't seen all candidates), but is much faster than waiting for the timeout.

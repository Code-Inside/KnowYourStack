(denied in EDIT1).\r\n\r\n1. Is there are way to fix this issue just by proper configuration?\r\n  - or modifying `getHoverStyle` CSS-in-JS variable is the only way?\r\n2. Do you consider this as a correct behavior or maybe a bug?\r\n  - if it's clear, move to discussions/help, please.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEDIT1:\r\n\r\nI noticed that it generated a broken CSS when using it with the hover variant:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Generated CSS - Utilities</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n.custom-hover {\r\n  border-radius: medium;\r\n  margin-left: -2px;\r\n  margin-right: -2px;\r\n  padding-left: 2px;\r\n  padding-right: 2px;\r\n  @media(hover:hover) {\r\n    & {\r\n      transition: background var(--p-transition-duration, .24s) ease;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    &:hover {\r\n      background: rgba(148, 149, 152, .18);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n.hover\\:custom-hover:hover {\r\n  border-radius: medium;\r\n  margin-left: -2px;\r\n  margin-right: -2px;\r\n  padding-left: 2px;\r\n  padding-right: 2px;\r\n  @media(hover:hover) {\r\n     {\r\n      transition: background var(--p-transition-duration, .24s) ease;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n     {\r\n      background: rgba(148, 149, 152, .18);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/11152","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Hover variant overrides a custom hover utility class styles in plugin\" (#11152)"},{"Id":"1694358715","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-03T15:59:27","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"11151","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update vite: 4.3.2 → 4.3.4 (patch)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

But The most important use case i use it in form validation. like this:\r\n```<input <!-- ... --> class=\"[&:not(:placeholder-shown):invalid]:ring-pink-400\" />```. \r\nWhat does that mean?

Both `pointer` and `hover` only test for the **primary** input. This means a touch device with trackpad connected (eg. iPad with Magic Keyboard) doesn’t show any hovers when using the trackpad when this flag is enabled.\r\n\r\nUsing [any-hover](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/any-hover) and [any-pointer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/any-pointer) should solve that issue, however simply changing the value might not be the best option, as some people could want the current behaviour. There also might be some edge cases I’m not seeing right now — likely some hybrid device which does some weird stuff in tablet vs laptop mode, etc. which could result in sticky hovers even with the flag enabled…\r\n\r\nA viable option might be to have control over which property is used, eg.\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfuture: {\r\n  hoverOnlyWhenSupported: \"primary\" | \"any\" | false,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is reproducible in XCode Simulator (click the \"Capture pointer\" button in top right) using the play link above. Here’s also a great page which shows the difference between the selectors and shows you what media your device currently matches:\r\nhttps://patrickhlauke.github.io/touch/pointer-hover-any-pointer-any-hover/\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI tried to solve this locally by first disabling the `hover` core plugin and wasn’t able to:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ncorePlugins: {\r\n  hover: false,\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooks like it’s not even specified in `CorePluginList` type. But then I tried simply adding a new custom `hover` variant and it allows me to override the core plugin, css output looks 👌 too — https://play.tailwindcss.com/TT1IC2V7xN\r\n\r\nSeems like this could be a viable short term solution for me, but it just doesn’t feel right…\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nplugins: [\r\n  function ({ addVariant }) {\r\n    addVariant('hover', '@media (any-hover: hover) and (any-pointer: fine) { &:hover }')\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/11109","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`hoverOnlyWhenSupported` doesn’t work with iPad trackpad\" (#11109)"},{"Id":"1685839392","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-27T09:41:24","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"11104","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update lightningcss: 1.18.0 → 1.20.0 (minor)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

This makes Node.js v14 a minimum requirement for Tailwind CSS.\r\n\r\nThe primary motivation for this change is to update our transitive dependency on `yaml` to resolve [CVE-2023-2251](https://huntr.dev/bounties/4b494e99-5a3e-40d9-8678-277f3060e96c/). While this CVE is not really relevant to a build-time project like Tailwind, it causes warnings for lots of people who check for these sorts of things in CI (by running `npm audit` for example) and creates a lot of headache.\r\n\r\nWe were originally going to wait until Tailwind CSS v4.0 to drop support for Node.js v12, but since it is end-of-life and hasn't been receiving security updates since 2022-04-30, we've decided we're comfortable making this change sooner even though it will require upgrading to a maintained version of Node.js for people that are still using v12.\r\n\r\nResolves #11081.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/11089","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Drop support for Node.js v12\" (#11089)"},{"Id":"1682994770","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-25T11:39:07","Actor":"hellosanbao","Number":"11090","RawContent":null,"Title":"jit mode compilet error with font-size","State":"closed","Body":"I  set the `font-size` like it: `text-[30rpx]`.\r\nI expect get`font-size:30rpx`,but the result is :`color:30rpx`,\r\nIt must end width 'px',but i want set 'rpx'\r\nversion: 3.3.1","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/11090","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"jit mode compilet error with font-size\" (#11090)"},{"Id":"1682891816","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-25T10:29:31","Actor":"jiri-thiemel-te","Number":"11088","RawContent":null,"Title":"Improve default reset of button styles for high contrast mode","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

Each button should have a border, even though it would be a transparent one. In high contrast mode background colours are overridden and buttons without border are very hard to identify in many scenarios as they look just like a regular text. Any border is also overridden with a custom contrast colour even the transparent one, which solves the issue. The problem is that many developers know about this issue and won't set a transparent border or custom appearance for high contrast scheme. And even those that do about this issue don't want to do this every time. There definitely should be reasonable defaults.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n\r\nChange the default button reset to include a transparent border.\r\n\r\nIf you consider this change problematic because of backwards compatibility, let's discuss alternative approach.\r\n\r\n**Related issues**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/2460","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/11088","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Improve default reset of button styles for high contrast mode\" (#11088)"},{"Id":"1682741175","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-25T09:02:05","Actor":"nathanaelytj","Number":"11087","RawContent":null,"Title":"Deps update CVE fix","State":"closed","Body":"Check Build","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/11087","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Deps update CVE fix\" (#11087)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2023-05-05T03:30:26.9113514Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":613}

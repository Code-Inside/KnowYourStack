Firstly, we need to read the full JavaScript config to get the _old_ prefix option. This is necessary because in v4, we will not allow things like custom-separators for the prefix. From this option we will then try and compute a new prefix (in 90% of the cases this is going to just remove the trailing `-` but it can also work in more complex cases).\r\n2. Then we migrate all Candidates. The important thing here is that we need to operate on the raw candidate string because by relying on `parseCandidate` (which we do for all other migrations) would not work, as the candidates are not valid in v4 syntax. More on that in a bit.\r\n3. Lastly we also make sure to update the CSS config to include the new prefix. This is done by prepending the prefix option like so:\r\n    \r\n    ```css\r\n    @import \"tailwindcss\" prefix(tw);\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Migrating candidates\r\n\r\nThe main difference between v3 prefixes and v4 prefixes is that in v3, the prefix was _part of the utility_ where as in v4 it is _always in front of the CSS class. \r\n\r\nSo, for example, this candidate in v3: \r\n\r\n```\r\nhover:-tw-mr-4\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould be converted to the following in v4:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntw:hover:-mr-4\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the first example _won't parse as a valid Candidate in v4, as the `tw-mr` utility does not exist, we have to operate on the raw candidate string first. To do this I created a fork of the `parseCandidate` function _without any validation of utilities or variants_. This is used to identify part of the candidate that is the `base` and then ensuring the `base` starts with the old prefix. We then remove this to create an \"unprefixed\" candidate that we validate against a version of the DesignSystem _with no prefixes configured_. If the variant is valid this way, we can then print it again with the `DesignSystem` that has the new prefix to get the migrated version.\r\n\r\nSince we set up the `DesignSystem` to include the new prefix, we can also be certain that migrations that happen afterwards would still disqualify candidates that aren't valid according to the new prefix policy. This does mean we need to have the prefix fixup be the first step in our pipeline.\r\n\r\nOne interesting bit is that in v3, arbitrary properties did not require prefixes where as in v4 they do. So the following candidate:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[color:red]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill be converted to:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntw:[color:red]\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14557","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Template migrations: Migrate v3 prefixes to v4\" (#14557)"},{"Id":"2559281756","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-01T15:00:20","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"14564","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add integration tests for multi-root builds","State":"closed","Body":"When your Vite or postcss project has multiple Tailwind CSS roots with different configs, they should not influence each other (with the exception of the same candidates being used).","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14564","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add integration tests for multi-root builds\" (#14564)"},{"Id":"2559429662","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-10-01T14:32:05","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"14565","RawContent":null,"Title":"Improve `@tailwindcss/postcss` performance for initial builds","State":"open","Body":"This PR improves the performance of the `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin.

We did this by adding the `@import` to the top of the file.\r\n\r\nWhile this is correct, this means that the diff might not be as clear. For example, if you have a situation where you have a license comment:\r\n```css\r\n/**! My license comment */\r\n@tailwind base;\r\n@tailwind components;\r\n@tailwind utilities;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis resulted in:\r\n```css\r\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\r\n/**! My license comment */\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile it is not wrong, it feels weird that this behaves like this. In this commit we make sure that it is injected in-place (the first `@tailwind` at-rule we find) and fixup the position if we can't inject it in-place.\r\n\r\nThe above example results in this:\r\n```css\r\n/**! My license comment */\r\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, there are scenario's where you can't replace the `@tailwind` directives directly. E.g.:\r\n```css\r\n/**! My license comment */\r\nhtml {\r\n  color: red;\r\n}\r\n@tailwind base;\r\n@tailwind components;\r\n@tailwind utilities;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we replace the `@tailwind` directives in-place, it would look like this:\r\n```css\r\n/**! My license comment */\r\nhtml {\r\n  color: red;\r\n}\r\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this is invalid CSS, because you can't have CSS above an `@import` at-rule. There are some exceptions like:\r\n- `@charset`\r\n- `@import`\r\n- `@layer foo, bar;` (just the order, without a body)\r\n- comments\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, we inject the import in the nearest place where it is allowed to. In this case:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n/**! My license comment */\r\n@import \"tailwindcss\";\r\n@layer base {\r\n  html {\r\n     color: red;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we will wrap the existing CSS in an `@layer` of the first Tailwind directive we saw. In this case an `@layer base`. This ensures that utilities still win from the default styles.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the (license) comment is allowed to exist before the `@import`, therefore we do not put the `@import` above it. This also means that the diff doesn't touch the license header at all, which makes the diffs cleaner and easier to reason about.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14536","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"CSS codemod: inject `@import` in a more expected location\" (#14536)"},{"Id":"2554910009","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-29T13:34:35","Actor":"fcrozatier","Number":"14548","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add a sensible default for alt texts","State":"closed","Body":"Hey! \r\n\r\nIn the rare cases of a broken image, when the alt text is displayed it's is styled as raw text by default.

Specifically, this version attempts to:\r\n\r\n- Allow migrations to access the raw candidate. This way we can migrate candidates that _would not parse as valid in v4_. This will help us migrate prefixes in candidates from v3 to v4.\r\n- There is no more awkward \"return null\" if nothing has changed. The return `null` was necessary because we relied on mutating the Variant and since parsing/printing could remove some information, it was not easy to find out wether a candidate needed to be migrated at all. With a string though, we can do this cheaply by returning the `rawCandidate`.\r\n- We previously asserted that if `parseCandidate` returns more than one candidate, we only picked the first one. This behavior is now moved into the migrations where we have more context. For now though, we still do not need to worry about this since in all cases, these duplicate candidates would serialize to the same `Candidate`. It is helpful if you only want to run a migration on a specific type of candidate (e.g. if there's a `static` one and a more generic `functional` one).  \r\n- We need access to the `DesignSystem` inside migrations now to be able to `parseCandidate`s.\r\n\r\nOpening this up as a separate PR since it can take some time to iron out the edge cases for the individual codemod PRs and I don't want to be rebasing all the time. \r\n\r\n## Before\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntype Migration = (candidate: Candidate) => Candidate | null\r\n```\r\n\r\n## After\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntype Migration = (designSystem: DesignSystem, rawCandidate: string) => string\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14539","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update template migration interface\" (#14539)"},{"Id":"2553171158","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-27T15:22:00","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"14538","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add the bg-gradient migration to the default list of template migrations","State":"closed","Body":"Quick follow-up from #14537 as I forgot to add the new migration to the default list of migrations.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14538","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Add the bg-gradient migration to the default list of template migrations\" (#14538)"},{"Id":"2553106893","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-27T14:52:57","Actor":"philipp-spiess","Number":"14537","RawContent":null,"Title":"Template migrations: Migrate `bg-gradient-*` utilities to `bg-linear-*`","State":"closed","Body":"In v4, we're making room for more gradient primitives with the addition of [gradient and conic gradient utilities](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14467).

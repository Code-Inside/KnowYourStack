Those are split into `max-*` variants and a group containing all `min-*` variants as well as the unprefixed static ones (e.g. `lg`, `sm`).\r\n\r\nWe currently define a custom sort order for all breakpoints variants that will compare their order based on the resolved value provided. So if you define `--breakpoint-sm: 100px` and `--breakpoint-lg: 200px`, we first check if both breakpoints have the same unit and then we rank based on the numerical value, making `sm` appear before `lg`.\r\n\r\nBut since the `min-*` variant and the `sm` variant share the same group, this also means that `min-sm` and `sm` as well as `min-lg` and `lg` will always have the same order (which makes sense—they also have the exact same CSS they generate!)\r\n\r\nThe issue now arises when you use these together with variant stacking. So, say you want to stack the two variants `max-lg:min-sm`. We always want stacked variants to appear _after_ their non-stacked individual parts (since they are more specific). To do this right now, we generate a bitfield based on the variant order. If you have four variants like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n| Order | Variant |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| 0  | `max-lg`  |\r\n| 1  | `max-sm`  |\r\n| 2  | `min-sm`  |\r\n| 3  | `min-lg`  |\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will assign one bit for each used variant starting from the lowest bit, so for the stack `max-lg:min-sm` we will set the bitfield to `0101` and those for the individual variants would result in `0100` (for `min-sm`) and `0001` (for `max-lg`). We then convert this bitfield to a number and order based on that number. This ensures that the stack always sorts higher.\r\n\r\nThe issue now arises from the fact that the variant order also include the unprefixed variants for a breakpoint. So in our case of `lg` and `sm`, the full list would look like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n| Order | Variant |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| 0  | `max-lg`  |\r\n| 1  | `max-sm`  |\r\n| 2  | `min-sm`  |\r\n| 3  | `sm`  |\r\n| 4  | `min-lg`  |\r\n| 5  | `lg`  |\r\n\r\nThis logic now breaks when you start to compute a stack for something like `max-lg:min-lg` _while also using the `lg` utility:\r\n\r\n| Stack | Bitmap | Integer Value |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| `max-lg:min-lg` | `010001` | 17 |\r\n| `lg` | `100000` | 18 |\r\n\r\nAs you can see here, the sole `lg` variant will now sort higher than the compound of `max-lg:min-lg`. That's not something we want!\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we need to encode the information of _same_ variant order somehow. A single array like the example above is not sufficient for this, since it will remove the information of the similar sort order. Instead, we now computed a list of nested arrays for the order lookup that will combine variants of similar values (while keeping the order the same). So from the 6 item array above, we now have the following nested array:\r\n\r\n| Order | Variant |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| 0  | [`max-lg`]  |\r\n| 1  | [`max-sm`]  |\r\n| 2  | [`min-sm`, `sm`]  |\r\n| 3  | [`min-lg`, `lg`]  |\r\n\r\nWhen we use the first layer index for the bitfield, we can now see how this solves the issue:\r\n\r\n| Stack | Bitmap | Integer Value |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| `max-lg:min-lg` | `1001` | 9 |\r\n| `lg` | `1000` | 8 |\r\n\r\nThat's pretty-much it! There are a few other changes in this PR that mostly handles with a small regression by this change where now, named `group` variants and unnamed `group` variants would now have the same order (something that was undefined behavior before).

I think the issue is related to how the tailwind compiler bundles CSS.\r\nI specified a custom keyframe in the tailwind.config.ts file for use in some one-off animations.\r\nThis feature documented here:\r\nhttps://tailwindcss.com/docs/animation#arbitrary-values\r\nI wanted the animations to be timed dynamically so I used string interpolation to attempt this:\r\n\r\n❌ Doesn't Work\r\n```typescript\r\nconst duration = 4;\r\nreturn (\r\n  <div className={`animate-[wiggle_${duration}s_ease-in-out_infinite]`}>\r\n  ...\r\n  </div>\r\n)\r\n// (assuming wiggle is a valid Keyframe in the tailwindcss.config.ts file)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis wouldn't work and I felt like I was going crazy.\r\nAfter some experimentation, I made a really unfortunate realization.\r\nFrom what I can intuit is that one-off animations compiled into individual classes during the tailwind compilation-step.\r\n\"animate-[wiggle_4s_ease-in-out_infinite]\"\r\nIs compiled as one fixed animation. It's not translating the specifications of the animation at runtime like I expect Tailwind's base classes to behave.\r\n\r\nMy band-aid solution is to just include comments with the dynamic variations of the animation I want.\r\nThe animations are pre-compiled and included in the CSS bundle to be dynamically iterated through.\r\n\r\n✅ Works\r\n```typescript\r\n  // animate-[giggle_1s_ease-in-out_infinite]\r\n  // animate-[giggle_2s_ease-in-out_infinite]\r\n  // animate-[giggle_3s_ease-in-out_infinite]\r\n  // animate-[giggle_4s_ease-in-out_infinite]\r\nconst duration = 3; // duration 1-4 is supported\r\nreturn (\r\n  <div className={`animate-[wiggle_${duration}s_ease-in-out_infinite]`}>\r\n  ...\r\n  </div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this behavior needs to be documented. Since this behavior a deviation from the expectations of TailwindCSS' design system but inevitable since CSS animations do need to be pre-compiled. I doubt most people actually get this far and would normally give up or reach for inline styles.

This has been a point of confusion and frustration for people [in the past](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/6504) who are annoyed they have to keep repeating their custom `leading-*` value like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"text-lg leading-none md:text-2xl md:leading-none lg:text-4xl lg:leading-none\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR lets you write this HTML instead but get the same behavior as above:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"text-lg leading-none md:text-2xl lg:text-4xl\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's important to note that this change _only_ applies to line-height values set explicitly with a `leading-*` utility, and does not apply to the line-height modifier.\r\n\r\nIn this example, the line-height set by `text-sm/6` does _not_ override the default line-height included in the `md:text-lg` utility:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"text-sm/6 md:text-lg\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat means these two code snippets behave differently:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"text-sm/6 md:text-lg\">…</div>\r\n<div class=\"text-sm leading-6 md:text-lg\">…</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the top one, the line-height `md:text-lg` overrides the line-height set by `text-sm/6`, but in the bottom one, the explicit `leading-6` utility takes precedence.\r\n\r\nThis PR applies the same improvements to `tracking-*` and `font-{weight}` as well, since all font size utilities can also optionally specify default `letter-spacing` and `font-weight` values.\r\n\r\nWe achieve this using new semi-private CSS variables like we do for things like transforms, shadows, etc., which are set by the `leading-*`, `tracking-*`, and `font-{weight}` utilities respectively. The `text-{size}` utilities always use these values first if they are defined, and the default values become fallbacks for those variables if they aren't present.\r\n\r\nWe use `@property` to make sure these variables are reset to `initial` on a per element basis so that they are never inherited, like with every other variable we define.\r\n\r\nThis PR does slightly increase the amount of CSS generated, because now utilities like `leading-5` look like this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n  .leading-5 {\r\n+   --tw-leading: 1.25rem;\r\n    line-height: 1.25rem;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n…and utilites like `text-sm` include a `var(…)` lookup that they didn't include before:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n  .text-sm {\r\n    font-size: 0.875rem;\r\n-   line-height: var(--font-size-sm--line-height, 1.25rem);\r\n+   line-height: var(--tw-leading, var(--font-size-sm--line-height, 1.25rem));\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this extra CSS doesn't feel worth it for the small improvement in behavior, we may consider just closing this PR and keeping things as they are.\r\n\r\nThis PR is also a breaking change for anyone who was depending on the old behavior, and expected the line-height baked into the `md:text-lg` class to take precedence over the explicit `leading-6` class:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"text-sm leading-6 md:text-lg\">…</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nPersonally I am comfortable with this because of the fact that you can still get the old behavior by preferring a line-height modifier:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"text-sm/6 md:text-lg\">…</div>\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/14403","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Don't override explicit `leading-*`, `tracking-*`, or `font-{weight}` utilities with font-size utility defaults\" (#14403)"},{"Id":"2520451994","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-11T18:28:52","Actor":"olets","Number":"14401","RawContent":null,"Title":"[v3] using a class with a variant generates css for the variant-free class too","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

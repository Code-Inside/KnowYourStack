Docs' Tailwind instance should scan `content: ['../ui/src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}']`\n2. Find classes like `bg-blue-500`, `text-white`, `px-5`, etc. in UI's Button.tsx\n3. Generate corresponding CSS utilities in docs' bundle\n4. Button should be styled correctly\n\n## Actual Behavior\n\n- Tailwind **only processes classes found in `docs/src/`**\n- Classes used in `../ui/src/` files are **completely ignored**\n- Button renders with **no styles** (all computed styles are 0 or default)\n- Console/Network shows CSS is loaded, but utility classes are missing\n\n## Workaround That Works\n\n**Build UI separately with its own Tailwind instance**\n\n1. Add Tailwind to UI package\n2. UI builds its own CSS → `dist/style.css`\n3. Docs imports the pre-built CSS:\n\n```tsx\n// docs/src/App.tsx\nimport { Button } from '@inz-ui/ui';\nimport '@inz-ui/ui/style.css';  // Pre-built CSS from UI package\n```\n\nThis works, but requires:\n- Maintaining two separate Tailwind instances\n- Building UI package before running docs\n- Running UI in watch mode during development (`vite build --watch`)\n- More complex development workflow\n\n## Attempts to Fix\n\n### ❌ Attempt 1: Import UI's CSS in docs (even without Tailwind in UI)\n```css\n/* docs/src/index.css */\n@import 'tailwindcss';\n@import '../../ui/src/index.css';  /* Just an empty file or regular CSS */\n```\n**Result**: Still doesn't scan UI components\n\n### ❌ Attempt 2: Absolute path in content\n```typescript\nimport { resolve } from 'path';\n\nexport default {\n  content: [resolve(__dirname, '../ui/src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}')],\n} satisfies Config;\n```\n**Result**: No change\n\n### ❌ Attempt 3: Add custom Vite plugin to pre-process UI files\n**Result**: Too complex, shouldn't be necessary\n\n## Question\n\n**Is cross-package content scanning supported in Tailwind CSS v4 with `@tailwindcss/vite`?**\n\nThis is a fundamental monorepo pattern where:\n- A UI library package provides raw components (no build step needed during dev)\n- A consumer package (docs/app) imports those components directly\n- Only the consumer package runs Tailwind to process all classes\n\nThis pattern is common in:\n- Design system documentation sites\n- Internal component library development\n- Storybook-style component showcases\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n- **Tailwind CSS v3 + PostCSS**: Works perfectly with the same setup\n- **Vite's HMR**: Works fine for component changes, just no styles\n- **Same-package scanning**: Works (docs' own files are processed correctly)\n- **Issue is specifically**: Cross-package file scanning in v4\n\nThe problem appears to be with how `@tailwindcss/vite` resolves the `content` glob patterns. It seems to only scan files within the same package, not relative paths outside the package root.\n\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/19313","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[@tailwindcss/vite - v4] Content scanning doesn't work with cross-package paths in monorepo\" (#19313)"},{"Id":"3627913556","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-11-15T07:07:42","Actor":"ValkyrieWing","Number":"19311","RawContent":null,"Title":"Base layer overiding the utility on abritary utility selector","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

We can always introduce support for the block direction separately in the future — no need for them to be introduced together and slow down the process.\r\n\r\nRight now we are using the shortest names possible like `ps-*` but if we eventually add block support and feel like that's too ambiguous, we can always support a more verbose version like `p-is-*` so that the block direction equivalent can be `p-bs-*`. My gut is that the block direction stuff will be needed so infrequently that simply making the block direction more verbose and keeping the inline ones terse is actually going to be the better trade-off though.\r\n\r\n**This PR does not include support for the logical values of `clear` or `float`**, as browser support is currently poor. We can of course revisit this in the future and add them another day when support is better.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/pull/10166","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add logical properties support for inline direction\" (#10166)"},{"Id":"1509012700","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-23T07:42:21","Actor":"Montago","Number":"10163","RawContent":null,"Title":"npx tailwindcss .... --watch is locking my files ","State":"open","Body":"I've installed the latest version of Tailwind (December 2022) and am using this guide : \r\nhttps://chrissainty.com/adding-tailwind-css-v3-to-a-blazor-app/\r\n\r\nusing this command: \r\n**npx tailwindcss -i ./app.css -o ./wwwroot/css/app.css --watch**\r\n\r\nWhile editing the Blazor files, the Powershell terminal compiles my CSS and is somewhat working fine. \r\n\r\nHowever - at some point i can't save the Razor / CSHTML files in Visual Studio because the files are locked by NPX / Node \r\nI then have to close Powershell / Tailwind builder to save my files. \r\n\r\nUltimately - i would much rather like to work with a pre-compiled subset version of Tailwind but have had a hard time finding the right way to select which features i want.

We are used to working with numbers as breakpoints as you can see in the screenshot below and we would like to keep using this as it's easier when there is a need to add an extra breakpoint. \r\n\r\n![Screenshot breakpoints](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69677343/207865029-2b4f5a0e-4227-4ab6-8f0b-1d3229d633b3.png)\r\n\r\nWe wrote some custom plugins to be able to define text styles like for example h1, in this way we can use typo-h1 which sets the right properties for font-family, font-size, line-height, etc. We also made them responsive. \r\nBy using numbers as breakpoints in the config file, we noticed that Tailwind puts the media queries defined in the tailwind config at the top which results in media queries being set before the default values. (see screenshots below - 1. tailwind config file - 2. console log of the config file in a custom plugin function)\r\n\r\n![tailwind config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69677343/207866172-1acce28d-c444-4517-8fc5-9aa0e62fbbc8.png)\r\n\r\n![console log tailwind config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69677343/207866187-acee24c5-59a8-4a9f-8e00-1490c1cca27b.png)\r\n\r\n### Reproduction\r\n1.

In an almost perfect world we can pass the transformer and extractor to the Rust based parser and call the callback functions to handle all of this. This is probably what we are going to do in the future but this requires more work to make sure that:\r\n\r\n1. It works as expected\r\n2. Doesn't result in (major) performance issues\r\n\r\nSince it currently doesn't work with the Rust based parser, we can implement a fix for this in the meantime before we reach the \"perfect\" solution.\r\n\r\nOne solution to this problem is to check if we do have a custom transformer or a custom extractor and if we do, then we can bail on the Rust parser completely and just use the current regex based parser.\r\n\r\nAn alternative solution, the solution implemented here, is that we group the `changedContent` into 2 buckets. The bucket where we rely on the default transformer and extractor and a bucket where a custom transformer or extractor is used.\r\n\r\nThen, the bucket where we use the default transformer and extractor can still rely on the way faster Rust based parser. For the other bucket we fallback to the regex based parser.\r\n\r\nThe nice part about this is that we can use both parsers at the same time, and the majority of the use cases should use the faster Rust based parser.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nüëã Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\r\n\r\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\r\n\r\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

For example, we can add the class left-[150px] to produce the CSS left: 150px;. However, this behavior is inconsistent when it comes to the right property.\r\n\r\nExpected Behavior:\r\nI expect that adding a class like right-[150px] should produce the CSS right: 150px;, similar to how the left property works.\r\n\r\nActual Behavior:\r\nAdding a class with the format right-[150px] does not produce the desired CSS output of right: 150px;. Instead, the class is ignored, and the right property remains unaffected.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Tailwind CSS supports local variables like start and end which should automatically adjust based on the set direction (e.g., ltr or rtl). These variables can be used in class names, such as {position}-{variable}. However, similarly to the 'right' issue, they also do not support that format.\r\n\r\nProposed Solution:\r\nTo ensure consistent behavior and enhance flexibility, I propose the following improvements to Tailwind CSS:\r\n\r\nImplement support for the right property, similar to how the left property works when using the {position}-{value} class format, as well as to the 'start' and the 'end' properties.\r\n\r\nBy implementing these changes, Tailwind CSS can provide a more comprehensive and consistent solution for positioning elements in various layout scenarios, especially in localized environments \r\n\r\nThank you for considering these improvements.</div>","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/11312","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Inconsistent Behavior for Positioning Classes in Tailwind\" (#11312)"},{"Id":"1731883986","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-30T10:21:51","Actor":"ruhul-appnap","Number":"11313","RawContent":null,"Title":"Tailwind Unable to resolve dynamic variable","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below.

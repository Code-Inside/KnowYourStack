Any folder matching the glob pattern is treated as a workspace project and is subject to the regular config resolution (single <code class=\"notranslate\">vitest.config.ts</code> or <code class=\"notranslate\">vite.config.ts</code> inside the folder)</li>\n<li>For example, <code class=\"notranslate\">projects/*</code> will match anything inside the <code class=\"notranslate\">projects</code> folder. If it's a folder, we try to find the config inside that folder (if there is none, it is still treated as a project with the default config). If it's a file, it will be treated as a Vitest config. <code class=\"notranslate\">projects/**/*</code> previously would assume that you only wanted to have folders as projects, but now it will match

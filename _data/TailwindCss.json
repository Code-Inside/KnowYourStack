This is prevalent when deploying to multiple servers. The same release will result in differing CSS build artifacts.\r\n\r\nWe experience this from time to time with a 404 error in the browser because the CSS filename on each server has a different hash. The HTML page is served from one server and then the CSS file is served by another server where the filename doesn't match.\r\n\r\nI've provided a copy of the output of two servers where you can see the order in which CSS selectors is different. Config is also provided.\r\n\r\nI want to say that this started with the move to Vite from Webpack.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else experienced this?\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1638\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/129096/213828059-a43d4b13-0ce5-490f-ab23-a3f50f0c0069.png\">\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/10378","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Order of CSS selectors is inconsistent each time the same build is run with Vite\" (#10378)"},{"Id":"1551528841","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-01-21T00:06:42","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"10377","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fine-tune `turbo.json` config to improve cache hits","State":"closed","Body":"This PR will fine-tune the `turbo.json` configure to hopefully improve the amoutn of cache hits.\n<!--\n\n👋 Hey, thanks for your interest in contributing to Tailwind!\n\n**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**\n\nIt's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature.

For context, i am working on a component library using the new vite tailwind plugin.\n\nIf you export tailwind 4 css into a tailwind 3 project (even with prefix) it throws due to: `@layer base is used but no matching @tailwind base directive is present.`. \n\nThe recommended workaround is to rename the layers as detailed [here](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/discussions/18123#discussioncomment-13245038).\n\nIn my case this looks like this:\n\n```css\n@layer swt-theme, swt-base, swt-components, swt-utilities;\n@import \"tailwindcss/theme.css\" layer(swt-theme) prefix(swt);\n@import \"tailwindcss/preflight.css\" layer(swt-base) prefix(swt);\n@import \"tailwindcss/utilities.css\" layer(swt-utilities) prefix(swt);\n\n@plugin \"daisyui\" {\n    themes: all;\n}\n```\n\nIn addition to tailwind i use daisyui 5 (compatible with tailwind 4). Because of the daisyui plugin, the final .css file still contains references to `@layer base` resulting in `@layer base is used but no matching @tailwind base directive is present`.\n\nI reported this as [issue](https://github.com/saadeghi/daisyui/issues/3937) with a [tailwind play link](https://play.tailwindcss.com/z19vEIqURl?file=css), but it seems that this issue cannot be adressed by the author of daisyui. \n\nI quote:\n> I understand.\n> Unfortunately, it's not possible yet to use another layer name due to Tailwind CSS plugin API.\n> Tailwind CSS provides APIs like addBase, addComponents, addUtilities\n> addBase always adds styles to Tailwind's predefined @layer base and addComponents, addUtilities always add styles to Tailwind's predefined @layer utilities.\n>\n> If Tailwind provides more access regarding this behavior, we may be able to provide an option as well.\n\nI hope that you can provide a way for plugin provider to either customize layer names or to correctly propagate any name changes in the tailwind config to the plugins.\n\nThis issue currently forces me to update the css file by hand before publishing, so it is really annoying 😅 \n\nThanks for your time, reading this!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18558","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Enable plugins to rename layer names\" (#18558)"},{"Id":"3234197609","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-16T14:20:14","Actor":"askdevai-bot","Number":"18549","RawContent":null,"Title":"docs: Add comprehensive LLM-friendly API reference","State":"closed","Body":"## Summary\n\nThis PR adds a comprehensive LLM-friendly API reference document (`LLM.md`) to the TailwindCSS repository.

We're a small team and we can't keep up with the volume of issues we receive if we need to reproduce each issue from scratch ourselves.\n\n**Describe your issue**\nWhen using Tailwind CSS v4.1.11 with a Hugo static site and the following config:\n\n```\nmodule.exports = {\n  darkMode: 'class',\n  content: [\n    './layouts/**/*.html',\n    './content/**/*.md'\n  ],\n  theme: {\n    extend: {\n      fontFamily: {\n        sans: ['Inter', 'Montserrat', 'sans-serif']\n      },\n      colors: {\n        primary: '#1e3a8a',\n        accent: '#38bdf8',\n        bgLight: '#f8fafc',\n        bgDark: '#181825'\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  plugins: [require('@tailwindcss/typography')],\n}\n```\n\nand running the CLI with:\n\n```\n\"tailwind\": \"tailwindcss -i ./assets/css/tailwind.css --config ./tailwind.config.js --content './layouts/**/*.html,./content/**/*.md' --minify -o static/css/output.css\"\n```\n\nso i initially created this workaround script in package.json, that worked in generating all the styles in output.css and being applied to site (except dark mode was still not working). I think it was still not reading darkMode setting from tailwind.config.js.\n```\n\"tailwind\": \"tailwindcss -i ./assets/css/tailwind.css --config $PWD/tailwind.config.js --content './layouts/**/*.html,./content/**/*.md' --minify > static/css/output.css\"\n```\n\n**Expected**:\nClass-based dark mode utilities (e.g., .dark\\:bg-gray-800) are generated, and toggling the dark class on <html> enables dark mode.\n\n**Actual**:\nOnly media-query-based dark utilities are generated (inside @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { ... }).\nToggling the dark class has no effect.\nDowngrading to Tailwind v3 (e.g., 3.4.3) with the same config and CLI command works perfectly and generates class-based dark utilities.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\nUse the config and CLI command above in a Hugo project.\nInspect the generated CSS for .dark\\:bg-gray-800 or similar class-based selectors.\nObserve that only media-query-based dark utilities are present.\n\n**Environment:**\n- Tailwind CSS v4.1.11\n- Node.js v23.5.0\n- macOS \n- Hugo v0.148.1\n\n**Repo/Minimal** (package.json):\n\n```\n{\n  \"name\": \"modern\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"tailwind\": \"tailwindcss -i ./assets/css/tailwind.css --config $PWD/tailwind.config.js --content './layouts/**/*.html,./content/**/*.md' --minify -o static/css/output.css\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [],\n  \"author\": \"\",\n  \"license\": \"ISC\",\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@tailwindcss/cli\": \"^4.1.11\",\n    \"@tailwindcss/typography\": \"^0.5.9\",\n    \"autoprefixer\": \"^10.4.21\",\n    \"postcss\": \"^8.5.6\",\n    \"tailwindcss\": \"^3.4.3\"\n  },\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"browserslist\": \"^4.25.1\",\n    \"caniuse-lite\": \"^1.0.30001727\",\n    \"electron-to-chromium\": \"^1.5.182\",\n    \"escalade\": \"^3.2.0\",\n    \"fraction.js\": \"^4.3.7\",\n    \"nanoid\": \"^3.3.11\",\n    \"node-releases\": \"^2.0.19\",\n    \"normalize-range\": \"^0.1.2\",\n    \"picocolors\": \"^1.1.1\",\n    \"postcss-value-parser\": \"^4.2.0\",\n    \"source-map-js\": \"^1.2.1\",\n    \"update-browserslist-db\": \"^1.1.3\"\n  },\n  \"description\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\n**Notes:**\nUsing the -o flag, absolute config path, and all recommended CLI options does not resolve the issue.\nThis breaks all class-based dark mode toggling for Hugo and similar static site generators.\n","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18547","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"darkMode: 'class' not respected in Tailwind CSS v4 CLI with Hugo (class-based dark utilities not generated)\" (#18547)"},{"Id":"3231322680","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-15T14:14:58","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"18541","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update @tybys/wasm-util 0.9.0 → 0.10.0 (major)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this upgrade.

It loads an `index.css` file from the Tailwind `node_modules` folder, as well as my own custom `root.css` file, which includes `@import 'tailwindcss'`. My CSS file includes the correct dark mode declarations, but the `index.css` file does not, which mixes up the declarations if you choose a color mode that is not the current `prefers-color-scheme`.\n\n<img width=\"1922\" height=\"940\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf04da75-2b34-4a8c-ab87-30577539a51e\" />\n\nSo I ended up with two versions of Tailwind  v4.1.11, each with CSS declarations that contradict each other.\n\n<img width=\"1682\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7600609-fa18-4a8a-885e-ec417c7669b2\" />\n\nI have already tried various methods of debugging and fixing it, but with no success.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18539","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Problem with dark mode because Tailwind v4 loads two CSS versions in dev mode\" (#18539)"},{"Id":"3229150681","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-14T15:59:51","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"18535","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update @emnapi/core 1.4.3 → 1.4.4 (patch)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

However, `.duration-normal` still works:\n```jsx\n<div class=\"duration-normal\"></div>\n```\n\n**❓Question:**\nHow can I use `&__done` style nesting again in Tailwind v4?\n\n**🔍 What I Tried:**\nI previously had this in postcss.config.js (Tailwind v3):\n```jsx\nplugins: {\n  'tailwindcss/nesting': {},\n  tailwindcss: {},\n  autoprefixer: {}\n}\n```\n\nBut in Tailwind v4, the docs recommend:\n```jsx\nplugins: {\n    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {}\n  }\n```\nAnd now the same nested &__done pattern doesn't compile.\n\n**⚠️ Why this matters:** \nI have 100+ files using this nesting style.Native CSS nesting syntax does not support this BEM-style shorthand.Refactoring all of this would be disruptive and risky.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18522","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Nesting with &__suffix no longer works after upgrading to Tailwind CSS v4\" (#18522)"},{"Id":"3228733485","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-14T14:27:53","Actor":"ivodolenc","Number":"18529","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unexpected behavior when custom `@theme` vars and `@utility` share same names","State":"closed","Body":"Hi, I just bumped into an issue where having a custom CSS variable defined in `@theme` with the same name as a custom `tw` `@utility` causes duplicate classes to be generated, with incorrect properties. This breaks the CSS and results in styles not rendering properly on the page.\n\nI'm using the latest version of `tailwind` in a `sveltekit` project with the default configuration. I also tested this in the official `tw` playground and I see the same behavior. Screenshots are attached so you can immediately see that something's wrong.\n\n<img width=\"375\" height=\"165\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e57fd84-205a-4972-b4b2-4985582f8faf\" />\n\n<img width=\"946\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e8270f5-f457-4ca4-90d6-aebc825f7742\" />\n\n<img width=\"347\" height=\"155\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cebcd21f-f6f8-4b8a-9738-0ef031dd9ef0\" />\n\n[Playground link](https://play.tailwindcss.com/U04WjTgJzA?file=css)\n\nI spent more than half an hour trying to find the problem. After renaming the custom variable, everything worked fine again. I believe this should be addressed, since CSS variables `--custom-name` and `tw` utilities `.custom-name` are diffirent concepts and shouldn't interfere with each other.\n\nI'm running into this because I want to define a custom utils and vars for variable font in the `@theme` config:\n\n```css\n@theme {\n  --font-400: 'wght' 400;\n  --font-ss-3: 'ss03' 1;\n}\n```\n\nSo I can use it later with custom util:\n\n```css\n@utility font-400 {\n  font-variation-settings: var(--font-400);\n}\n\n@utility font-ss-3 {\n  font-feature-settings: var(--font-ss-3);\n}\n```\n\nor via custom css directly if needed:\n\n```css\np {\n  font-variation-settings: var(--font-600);\n  font-feature-settings: var(--font-ss-3);\n}\n```\n\nThese variable names should remain isolated, custom properties under `@theme` shouldn’t conflict with custom `@utilities`.\n\n**In short**: everything works as expected unless a custom `@theme` variable shares its name with a custom `@utility`, in that case, CSS breaks due to conflicting class generation.","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18529","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Unexpected behavior when custom `@theme` vars and `@utility` share same names\" (#18529)"},{"Id":"3223761839","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-14T14:06:09","Actor":"depfu[bot]","Number":"18513","RawContent":null,"Title":"Update eslint 9.29.0 → 9.30.1 (minor)","State":"closed","Body":"\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about this update.

This pattern worked in Tailwind CSS v3 but appears broken in v4.\n\nIn particular, combining `@apply` with responsive and pseudo-class utilities inside Angular's SCSS context (`::ng-deep`) no longer compiles or applies styles as it used to.\n\n---\n\n### Example SCSS Code Illustrating the Problem:\n\n```scss\n@use '@angular/material' as mat;\n@reference 'tailwindcss';\n\n:host {\n  ::ng-deep {\n    .task-list {\n      @include mat.form-field-density(-1);\n\n      @apply hover:md:bg-red-500; // ❌ Not working in v4, worked in v3\n\n      &:hover {\n        @apply md:bg-red-500; // ❌ Not working in v4, worked in v3\n      }\n\n      .mdc-label {\n        @apply font-medium text-red-500; // ✅ Still works\n      }\n\n      .mat-mdc-checkbox-checked {\n        @apply pointer-events-none opacity-50;\n\n        .mdc-label {\n          @apply line-through!; // ✅ Still works\n        }\n      }\n\n      .action-trigger {\n        @apply md:opacity-0; // ❌ Not working as it did in v3 — no longer hidden on large screens\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThese patterns are used widely across our large Angular application, and after the v4 upgrade, many component styles have silently broken. While base utilities like `@apply text-red-500` still function, any usage of `@apply` with media queries or pseudo-classes(hover,placeholder...) appears to be ignored or stripped during build.\n\n### Impact\nThis is a critical issue for us:\n- We have a large codebase heavily reliant on these patterns.\n- Refactoring hundreds of components manually would be a major setback.\n- There was no mention of this change in the upgrade guide as of now.\n\n### Please confirm:\n\n- Is this behavior expected in Tailwind CSS v4?\n- Was support for `@apply + media/pseudo` utilities removed by design?\n- If so, is there a workaround or plugin we can adopt short-term?\n\nAny guidance or fix would be hugely appreciated. We're happy to provide further context or contribute to a fix if this is unintended.\n\nThank you!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/18519","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"[v4] Regression: Media queries inside @apply not working as expected compared to v3\" (#18519)"},{"Id":"3225388864","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-12T17:40:26","Actor":"mwnciau","Number":"18516","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unable to set property value to \"inherit\" in the CSS config","State":"closed","Body":"**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**\n\nv4.0.9\n\n**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**\n\nElixir Phoenix using the Tailwind 0.3.1 elixir package, built using the esbuild 0.9.0 elixir package, which is using esbuild 0.17.11\n\n**What version of Node.js are you using?**\n\nv22.16.0\n\n**What browser are you using?**\n\nFirefox\n\n**What operating system are you using?**\n\nUbuntu\n\n**Reproduction URL**\n\nhttps://play.tailwindcss.com/vJ8zniNWjT\n\n**Describe your issue**\n\nIt is impossible to set a custom theme variable to \"inherit\" using a CSS config.

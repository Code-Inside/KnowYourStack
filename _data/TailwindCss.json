So I installed `nvm` into the environment, and added `.nvmrc`, which is presently set to node v22.12.0.\n\nIn the repro IDX environment (above), run `npm run typecheck` (which is Astro's wrapper around `tsc`). The errors in `vitest.config.ts` and `astro.config.ts` are what's pertinent to this issue.\n\nThe errors will resolve if you run either of the following corrective workflows:\n\n```bash\nnpm rm tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite\nrm -rf node_modules/\nrm package-lock.json\nnpm i\n```\n\nThen, comment out `astro.config.ts` tailwind stuff before running type checking, like so:\n\n```js\n// import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  vite: {\n    // plugins: [tailwindcss()],\n  },\n});\n```\n\nThen run `npm run typecheck`. You'll see the `vitest.config.ts` type error inside Astro's Vite config is no longer there, after uninstalling `tailwindcss` and `@tailwindcss/vite`.\n\nSomething's up with Tailwind and Vite inside Astro!\n\n---\n\nAlternatively, instead of the above corrective workflow, you can downgrade node, like so:\n\n```bash\nnvm use 22.10.0 --save\nrm -rf node_modules/\nrm package-lock.json\nnpm i\nnpm run typecheck\n```\n\nUnfortunately, I need node greater than or equal to v22.12, so this is not an option!","Url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/19210","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Tailwind Vite plugin in Astro causes type errors in Astro Vite config in Node >=22.12\" (#19210)"},{"Id":"3556036754","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-10-27T10:14:14","Actor":"RobinMalfait","Number":"19216","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump Vitest to v4","State":"open","Body":"This PR bumps Vitest from v2 to v4.

This will be most noticeable in Intellisense.\r\n\r\nThe big issue we had is that we used module scoped Map objects where we cache data based on the DesignSystem. If you then create new design systems (often), then the cache would just keep growing and growing.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves that by essentially storing all the caches on the Design System itself. This way, when you throw away a Design System, all the caches go with it.\r\n\r\nAnother approach would've been to use a WeakMap, but then we would have to make sure that no strong references to the DesignSystem exist anywhere else, otherwise we would still have the same memory issues.\r\n\r\nNote: make sure to go commit by commit and use `?w=1` to ignore whitespace changes.\r\n\r\n## Test plan\r\n\r\n1.

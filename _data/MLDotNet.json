After turning on `LD_Debug`, it seems that one of the missing dependencies is `GLIBC_2.34`. Note that the image for helix test is still `centos 8 streaming` which glib version is 2.28. This could be the why the torchsharp test failures.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nfile=/temp/workitems/Microsoft.ML.TorchSharp.Tests/runtimes/linux-x64/native/libtorch_cpu.so\r\n       260:\r\n       260:     find library=libgomp-98b21ff3.so.1 [0]; searching\r\n       260:      search path=/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib64            (LD_LIBRARY_PATH)\r\n       260:       trying file=/usr/local/lib/libgomp-98b21ff3.so.1\r\n       260:       trying file=/usr/local/lib64/libgomp-98b21ff3.so.1\r\n       260:      search path=/temp/workitems/Microsoft.ML.TorchSharp.Tests/runtimes/linux-x64/native            (RUNPATH from file /temp/workitems/Microsoft.ML.TorchSharp.Tests/runtimes/linux-x64/native/libtorch_cpu.so)\r\n       260:       trying file=/temp/workitems/Microsoft.ML.TorchSharp.Tests/runtimes/linux-x64/native/libgomp-98b21ff3.so.1\r\n       260:\r\n       260:     /lib64/libc.so.6: error: version lookup error: version `GLIBC_2.34' not found (required by /temp/workitems/Microsoft.ML.TorchSharp.Tests/runtimes/linux-x64/native/libLibTorchSharp.so) (fatal)\r\n       260:     find library=libLibTorchSharp.so [0]; searching\r\n       260:      search path=/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib64            (LD_LIBRARY_PATH)\r\n       260:       trying file=/usr/local/lib/libLibTorchSharp.so\r\n       260:       trying file=/usr/local/lib64/libLibTorchSharp.so\r\n       260:      search cache=/etc/ld.so.cache\r\n       260:      search path=/lib64/tls:/lib64:/usr/lib64/tls:/usr/lib64                (system search path)\r\n       260:       trying file=/lib64/tls/libLibTorchSharp.so\r\n       260:       trying file=/lib64/libLibTorchSharp.so\r\n       260:       trying file=/usr/lib64/tls/libLibTorchSharp.so\r\n       260:       trying file=/usr/lib64/libLibTorchSharp.so\r\n       260:\r\n       260:     find library=LibTorchSharp [0]; searching\r\n       260:      search path=/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib64            (LD_LIBRARY_PATH)\r\n       260:       trying file=/usr/local/lib/LibTorchSharp\r\n       260:       trying file=/usr/local/lib64/LibTorchSharp\r\n       260:      search cache=/etc/ld.so.cache\r\n       260:      search path=/lib64/tls:/lib64:/usr/lib64/tls:/usr/lib64                (system search path)\r\n       260:       trying file=/lib64/tls/LibTorchSharp\r\n       260:       trying file=/lib64/LibTorchSharp\r\n       260:       trying file=/usr/lib64/tls/LibTorchSharp\r\n       260:       trying file=/usr/lib64/LibTorchSharp\r\n       260:\r\n       260:     find library=libLibTorchSharp [0]; searching\r\n       260:      search path=/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib64            (LD_LIBRARY_PATH)\r\n       260:       trying file=/usr/local/lib/libLibTorchSharp\r\n       260:       trying file=/usr/local/lib64/libLibTorchSharp\r\n       260:      search cache=/etc/ld.so.cache\r\n       260:      search path=/lib64/tls:/lib64:/usr/lib64/tls:/usr/lib64                (system search path)\r\n       260:       trying file=/lib64/tls/libLibTorchSharp\r\n       260:       trying file=/lib64/libLibTorchSharp\r\n       260:       trying file=/usr/lib64/tls/libLibTorchSharp\r\n       260:       trying file=/usr/lib64/libLibTorchSharp\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

I have used AutoML for Image Classification with 10 images each of cat and dog and generated the model(MLModel.zip~93MB) and c# code. ... I have been successful in loading the model in a function app locally and it works flawlessly giving the predictions properly. Source code attached.\r\n\r\nSteps: \r\n- Create Image Classification project using AutoML-Model Builder\r\n- Generate Model(MLModel.zip) and C# Code\r\n- Use MLModel.zip in Azure function\r\n- Run it locally - Works fine\r\n- Publish to Azure Function(Cloud) - Function App(Windows)\r\n- 'tensorflow' DllNotFound exception is thrown\r\n- Change 'Deployment Mode' to 'Self-Contained' and Target Runtime to 'win-x64'. Also change Platform Settings from 32-bit to 64-bit in Azure Function setting in portal.\r\n- Hit API from REST Client(Postman) : Classification is done successfuly\r\n- Hit API second time or consecutively - SSHException is thrown at PredictionEngine.Predict() method.\r\n\r\n**What happened?**\r\n- Deploying the same function over Azure Function(Cloud) gave DllNotFound exception for tensorflow dll during loading of the model. \r\n- Referred https://developers.de/2019/10/25/hosting-ml-net-in-appservice/ and changed Target Runtime to x64. Tensorflow dll not found error disappeared. \r\n- Hit Function API through Postman first time after above change and it was successful with proper prediction.\r\n- However, when API is hit second or consecutively, SSHException is thrown during prediction using PredictionEngine. \r\n\r\n**What did you expect?**\r\n- No exception at predictionEngine.Predict() while executing in Azure Function(cloud)\r\n- A similar issue reported over SO https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62947625/ml-net-tensorflow-image-clasification-crashes-with-sehexception-when-run-in-azur but there is no solution yet.\r\n- References\r\n - https://github.com/SciSharp/TensorFlow.NET/issues/485\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/4112\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n\r\nPlease paste or attach the code or logs or traces that would be helpful to diagnose the issue you are reporting.\r\n\r\n**Source Code:** Attached zip file : src.zip\r\n**Azure Function Project:** TestImageClassificationFunctionApp\r\n**Steps, call stack, snippets, logs:** ./testimageclassification/**Readme.md**\r\n**Diagnostic logs:** ./testimageclassification/diagnosis/\r\n\r\n**Exception:** System.Runtime.InteropServices.SEHException\r\n**FailedMethod:** Tensorflow.c_api.TF_SessionRun\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nSystem.Runtime.InteropServices.SEHException:\r\n   at Tensorflow.c_api.TF_SessionRun (TensorFlow.NET, Version=0.11.8.1, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51)\r\n   at Microsoft.ML.TensorFlow.TensorFlowUtils+Runner.Run (Microsoft.ML.TensorFlow, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51)\r\n   at Microsoft.ML.Vision.ImageClassificationModelParameters+Classifier.Score (Microsoft.ML.Vision, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51)\r\n   at Microsoft.ML.Vision.ImageClassificationModelParameters+<>c__DisplayClass22_0`2.<Microsoft.ML.Data.IValueMapper.GetMapper>b__0 (Microsoft.ML.Vision, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51)\r\n   at Microsoft.ML.Data.PredictedLabelScorerBase.EnsureCachedPosition (Microsoft.ML.Data, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51)\r\n   at Microsoft.ML.Data.MulticlassClassificationScorer+<>c__DisplayClass16_0.<GetPredictedLabelGetter>b__0 (Microsoft.ML.Data, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51)\r\n   at Microsoft.ML.Transforms.KeyToValueMappingTransformer+Mapper+KeyToValueMap`2+<>c__DisplayClass8_0.<GetMappingGetter>b__0 (Microsoft.ML.Data, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51)\r\n   at Microsoft.ML.Data.TypedCursorable`1+TypedRowBase+<>c__DisplayClass9_0`2.<CreateConvertingActionSetter>b__0 (Microsoft.ML.Data, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51)\r\n   at Microsoft.ML.Data.TypedCursorable`1+TypedRowBase.FillValues (Microsoft.ML.Data, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51)\r\n   at TestImageClassificationFunctionApp.ClassifyImage+<Run>d__0.MoveNext (TestImageClassificationFunctionApp, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Azure Function *.csproj **\r\n```poweshell\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netcoreapp3.1</TargetFramework>\r\n    <AzureFunctionsVersion>v3</AzureFunctionsVersion>\r\n    <UserSecretsId>xxxxx-xxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxx</UserSecretsId>\r\n    <Platforms>AnyCPU;x64</Platforms>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Azure.Storage.Blobs\" Version=\"12.5.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Storage\" Version=\"3.0.10\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.ML\" Version=\"1.5.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.ML.ImageAnalytics\" Version=\"1.5.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.ML.Vision\" Version=\"1.5.1\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions\" Version=\"3.0.7\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"SciSharp.TensorFlow.Redist\" Version=\"2.1.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <None Update=\"host.json\">\r\n      <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>\r\n    </None>\r\n    <None Update=\"local.settings.json\">\r\n      <CopyToOutputDirectory>PreserveNewest</CopyToOutputDirectory>\r\n      <CopyToPublishDirectory>Never</CopyToPublishDirectory>\r\n    </None>\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know in case any more information is required.\r\n\r\n[src.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/files/5113449/src.zip)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/5361","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Second time prediction using PredictionEngine in ML.Net throws SEHException in Azure Function deployed to Cloud.

However, in the \"Add the code to make predictions\" section described on this page, we will test the image in step 3 and the result in step 7 in the same section (Predicted Boxes Of Result on the page, I mean its your result:\r\nTop: 89.453415, Left: 481.95343, Right: 724.8073, Bottom: 388.32385, Label: Stop-Sign, Score: 0.99539465\r\nTest Image:\r\n![test-image1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24530432/115974481-bd3b6b80-a565-11eb-934c-fb6994b5bc8c.jpeg)\r\n\r\nResult Image:\r\n![asd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24530432/115974483-c9bfc400-a565-11eb-92cf-6eb9691cbc46.jpeg)\r\n\r\n), the resulting image does not apply to the Stop Sign in the picture. He points to another area in that picture.\r\n\r\nThen I experimented with more pictures with my model, but again, the results obtained by Predicted Boxes do not match the Stop Sign in any of the images. In other words, this application we run on Azure gives erroneous results.\r\n\r\nOr am I missing something?\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/5763","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The Prediction results on the tutorial page and the result of the application are incorrect.\" (#5763)"},{"Id":"861071741","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-23T22:40:05","Actor":"uzfm","Number":"5752","RawContent":null,"Title":"ML.NET support CUDA 11","State":"closed","Body":"ML.NET support CUDA 11\r\nLoading model from: F:\\V2Sorter\\DataSet\\03.01.2021\\imageClassifier_2.zip\r\n2021-04-16 16:06:33.457209: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1720] Found device 0 with properties:\r\npciBusID: 0000:03:00.0 name: GeForce RTX 3080 computeCapability: 8.6\r\ncoreClock: 1.905GHz coreCount: 68 deviceMemorySize: 10.00GiB deviceMemoryBandwidth: 707.88GiB/s\r\n2021-04-16 16:06:33.458465: I tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:49] Successfully opened dynamic library cudart64_110.dll\r\n2021-04-16 16:06:33.459114: I tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:49] Successfully opened dynamic library cublas64_11.dll\r\n2021-04-16 16:06:33.459639: I tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:49] Successfully opened dynamic library cublasLt64_11.dll\r\n2021-04-16 16:06:33.460164: I tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:49] Successfully opened dynamic library cufft64_10.dll\r\n2021-04-16 16:06:33.460705: I tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:49] Successfully opened dynamic library curand64_10.dll\r\n2021-04-16 16:06:33.461270: I tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:49] Successfully opened dynamic library cusolver64_10.dll\r\n2021-04-16 16:06:33.461946: I tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:49] Successfully opened dynamic library cusparse64_11.dll\r\n2021-04-16 16:06:33.462589: I tensorflow/stream_executor/platform/default/dso_loader.cc:49] Successfully opened dynamic library cudnn64_8.dll\r\n2021-04-16 16:06:33.463409: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1862] Adding visible gpu devices: 0\r\n2021-04-16 16:06:33.464111: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1261] Device interconnect StreamExecutor with strength 1 edge matrix:\r\n2021-04-16 16:06:33.464830: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1267] 0\r\n2021-04-16 16:06:33.465221: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1280] 0: N\r\n2021-04-16 16:06:33.465788: I tensorflow/core/common_runtime/gpu/gpu_device.cc:1406] Created TensorFlow device (/job:localhost/replica:0/task:0/device:GPU:0 with 7745 MB memory) -> physical GPU (device: 0, name: GeForce RTX 3080, pci bus id: 0000:03:00.0, compute capability: 8.6)\r\nException thrown: 'System.EntryPointNotFoundException' in Microsoft.ML.Vision.dll\r\ndevice is disconnected\r\nException thrown: 'System.IO.FileNotFoundException' in mscorlib.dll\r\nException thrown: 'System.IO.FileNotFoundException' in mscorlib.dll\r\nThe thread 0x2f80 has exited with code 0 (0x0).\r\n\r\nI'm using \"SciSharp.TensorFlow.Redist-Windows-GPU\" with CUDA 2.4.0 support but get the exception \"Exception thrown: 'System.EntryPointNotFoundException' in Microsoft.ML.Vision.dll\"\r\nwhat could be the problem?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/5752","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"ML.NET support CUDA 11\" (#5752)"},{"Id":"866334823","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-23T18:20:59","Actor":"Tweekaz2018","Number":"5762","RawContent":null,"Title":"Splitter/consolidator worker encountered exception while consuming source data","State":"open","Body":"### System information\r\n\r\nWindow Server R2 2012 x64\r\n- ** .net 5\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\n- Image classification for 4 classes. 16000(4000 per cat) images\r\n- Exception \r\n- Trained model\r\n\r\nWhen i had 2500 images per class it was ok.

The model simply predicts intent based on a question provided (that comes from the user). Things work relatively well when the phrases are close to the training set but I start getting some weird random results for totally unrelated terms. Looking at scores, these appear to be normalized so they add up to 1. That means that I can get a relatively high score (often around +-0.8) for a phrase that have nothing to do with any question from the training set. I am wondering if:\r\na) Is there a way to get unnormalized scores, e.g. the sum of the scores is <0,1> where the closer it is to 1, the higher confidence there is.\r\nb) General confidence value that would simply tell me if I should trust the output of the prediction?\r\n\r\nI was considering creating 2 models, one with a bunch of random text that is labeled as 0 and the actual training phrases labeled as 1.

Hope you help me figure out which one of these.\r\n\r\nWe have a service used by N clients. Each of these clients uses (and frequently retrain) a single Engine (model). Clients also come and go so I can have N clients at one point and M a little while later where M != N. Sidenote, the number of clients could be anywhere between few tens to few hundreds or maybe thousands.\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that fetching a prediction model from URI (that's our case, some people fetch from file system) and subsequent deserialization and setup is relatively expensive. \r\n\r\nAs far as I know, the prediction engine is also not thread-safe.\r\n\r\nI assume that's why the PredictionEnginePool was created. \r\n\r\nOur problem is the prediction engine pool is the only population during the app start. Also, there is some model auto-update functionality (watch) which doesn't work very well in our case as it introduces a lot of overhead. Imagine I have 1000 clients and I refetch 1000 models every X seconds.\r\n\r\nWhat I am thinking about is having the ability to:\r\n1. Add and remove model definitions from the pool on the fly.\r\n2. Reload models (by name) from code (only when the model is retrained). Sidenote: This might need to be synced by some mechanism if there is more than one server (Redis, messaging, or something like that).\r\n3. Have some sort of mechanism where only the most frequently used models are kept in memory.\r\na) Maybe timeout? E.g. when the model is requested and it doesn't exist, create it. Then keep it for X minutes with a moving window that is refreshed always when the same engine is requested again.\r\nb) Probably introduce some fixed limit of concurrent models where if we run out of this limit, we simply drop the oldest model and create this new one.\r\nc) Point 3.b) could introduce some callbacks that would help with autoscaling which would not only be very useful but also pretty cool IMHO.\r\nd) Naturally because it's not threadsafe, we actually have to keep more than one instance of each engine which is again something that can be optimized via some timeout, moving windows, fixed limits, and so on.\r\ne) Would be good to have some sort of middleware architecture here that allows one to gain insights into how models are requested.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? I know this probably has no place to exist in the CORE repo and maybe belongs more in the userland. But maybe parts of it could? I would very much appreciate any feedback that would lead me to the correct path.

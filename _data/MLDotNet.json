Please describe.**\r\nYou’re doing a lot of great work, but I think better OLS support would be really valuable. \r\n\r\nI know that your focus is industry-facing advanced ML, but it's hard to introduce the framework for those advanced models in an educational setting when ML.NET cannot handle basic OLS. I'd also guess that facilitating the use of ML.NET in an educational setting is helpful for meeting long-term performance objectives such as increasing industry adoption.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, it is frustrating to try using ML.NET in an educational setting. You have great advanced features, but OLS is the standard \"baseline\" trainer and it's impossible to use OLS with ML.NET for teaching because the OLS trainer in ML.NET relies on MKL and is thus not cross-platform. Accord.NET, MathNet.Numerics, and FSharp.Stats all have cross-platform OLS trainers. This is entirely feasible in managed code.\r\n\r\nRelated to below issues\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/5788#issuecomment-841230567\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/5696\r\n- https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/5787\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI should be able to use an OLS trainer on windows, linux, macOS x64 and macOS apple silicon, and all dependencies should come via (possibly platform specific) nuget feeds (no homebrew!). DiffSharp and TorchSharp are good prior art of high performance platform-specific nuget packages.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/6149","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Facilitate ML.NET for education by prioritizing cross-platform OLS\" (#6149)"},{"Id":"1191715399","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-04T20:39:55","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"6148","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:97926d79-6b8b-4d32-c8db-08d9d479971c)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: 97926d79-6b8b-4d32-c8db-08d9d479971c\r\n- **Build**: 20220331.2\r\n- **Date Produced**: March 31, 2022 3:37:49 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: e0b311bcd81fc9e27bcf7715dcda62fa38dfa49a\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

[trainer-estimator.json](https://github.com/LittleLittleCloud/machinelearning/blob/u/xiaoyun/addRuntime2/src/Microsoft.ML.AutoML/CodeGen/trainer-estimators.json) and [transformer-estimator.json](https://github.com/LittleLittleCloud/machinelearning/blob/u/xiaoyun/addRuntime2/src/Microsoft.ML.AutoML/CodeGen/transformer-estimators.json)\r\n\r\nOne example class looks like (kindly notice that the generated class is a partial class, and we manually code the rest of this class) \r\n``` csharp\r\ninternal partial class LightGbmBinary : SweepableEstimator<LgbmOption>\r\n{\r\n        public LightGbmBinary(LgbmOption defaultOption, SearchSpace<LgbmOption> searchSpace = null)\r\n        {\r\n            this.TParameter =

         this.EstimatorType = EstimatorType.LightGbmBinary;\r\n            this.TParameter = new LgbmOption();\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        internal override IEnumerable<string> CSharpUsingStatements \r\n        {\r\n            get => new string[] {\"using Microsoft.ML;\", \"using Microsoft.ML.Trainers;\", \"using Microsoft.ML.Trainers.LightGbm;\", };\r\n        }\r\n\r\n

this\r\n```csharp\r\ninternal partial class LightGbmBinary\r\n{\r\n        public override IEstimator<ITransformer> BuildFromOption(MLContext context, LgbmOption param)\r\n        {\r\n            var

estimators\r\nThis is because of \r\n- Avoiding having a giant factory class.\r\n- the generated `SweepableEstimator` class includes useful information for modelbuilder to reconstruct source code training pipeline ( such as `UsingStatement`/`NugetDependency` )\r\n\r\n## Will those generated classes be internal only\r\n\r\nThat's the plan, external users will have to use

works fine and the feature vectors are calculated correctly,\r\nAs soon as I try to create  the sample data at run time all featurevectors always result 0.\r\n\r\nActually all microsoft examples I found similar to this code  are fixed values and known at compile time.\r\n\r\nI attach my pipeline code below,  is this a bug, a behaviour or some error in my logic?

This centralizes all package version management in a single `Directory.Packages.props` file while ensuring the same packages and versions are restored.\n\n## Changes Made\n\n### Core Implementation\n- **Created `Directory.Packages.props`** with 89 PackageVersion items organized by category:\n  - Product dependencies (Apache.Arrow, Newtonsoft.Json, System.* packages, etc.)\n  - Test-only dependencies (MSTest, XUnit, coverlet, etc.) \n  - Build/infrastructure dependencies (MicroBuild, Arcade tools, etc.)\n- **Enabled `ManagePackageVersionsCentrally=true`** property to activate central package management\n- **Removed Version attributes** from all PackageReference items across:\n  - 64 .csproj files\n  - 4 .props/.targets files (test/Directory.Build.props, Directory.Build.targets, etc.)\n\n### Version Management\n- All package versions use existing properties from `eng/Versions.props` (e.g., `$(NewtonsoftJsonVersion)`, `$(SystemCollectionsImmutableVersion)`)\n- Maintains consistency with current version management approach\n- No changes to actual package versions - only centralized the management\n\n### Package Resolution Validation\n- ✅ Core projects restore successfully (Microsoft.ML.Core, Microsoft.ML.Data, Microsoft.ML.DataView)\n- ✅ Test projects restore successfully (Microsoft.ML.Tests, Microsoft.ML.Core.Tests)  \n- ✅ Sample projects restore successfully (Microsoft.ML.Samples, Microsoft.ML.Samples.OneDal)\n- ✅ Production projects restore successfully (Microsoft.ML.AutoML, Microsoft.ML.ImageAnalytics)\n- ✅ Package versions resolve correctly (verified via project.assets.json files)\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **Centralized Management**: All package versions now managed in single location\n2. **Consistency**: Eliminates version conflicts across projects\n3. **Maintainability**: Easier to update package versions repository-wide\n4. **Transitive Pinning**: Enables better control over transitive dependencies\n\n## Validation\n\nThe conversion was validated by:\n- Individual project restore testing across core, test, and sample projects\n- Verification that resolved package versions match expected versions from Versions.props\n- Confirmation that no PackageReference Version attributes remain in project files\n\n**Note**: Some GenAI projects have temporary restore failures due to network issues with `JsonSchema.Net.Generation` package from Azure DevOps feeds, but this is unrelated to the central package management conversion and will resolve when the feed is accessible.\n\nFixes #7479.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n>\n> <details>\n> <summary>Firewall rules blocked me from connecting to one or more addresses</summary>\n>\n> #### I tried to connect to the following addresses, but was blocked by firewall rules:\n>\n> - `dnceng.pkgs.visualstudio.com`\n>   - Triggering command: `dotnet restore Microsoft.ML.sln ` (dns block)\n>   - Triggering command: `dotnet restore src/Microsoft.ML.GenAI.LLaMA/Microsoft.ML.GenAI.LLaMA.csproj ` (dns block)\n>\n> If you need me to access, download, or install something from one of these locations, you can either:\n>\n> - Configure [Actions setup steps](https://gh.io/copilot/actions-setup-steps) to set up my environment, which run before the firewall is enabled\n> - Add the appropriate URLs or hosts to my [firewall allow list](https://gh.io/copilot/firewall-config)\n>\n> </details>\n\n\n<!-- START COPILOT CODING AGENT TIPS -->\n---\n\n💬 Share your feedback on Copilot coding agent for the chance to win a $200 gift card!

I use the kMeansTrainer for the clustering. It works - but during the \"training\" (which takes ~75 s) ...\n\n```csharp\nvar model = pipeline.Fit(trainingData);\n```\n... the CPU load is less than 20% on a i7-11850H @ 2.5 GHz CPU with 16 threads. If I got the ML.Net code right, it allows max. 16 / 2 = 8 threads. But I can set the `NumberOfThreads` in the trainer options from 1 to 8 - it doesn't change anything.\n\n```csharp\n            var options = new KMeansTrainer.Options\n            {\n                NumberOfClusters = numberOfClusters,\n                // InitializationAlgorithm = KMeansTrainer.InitializationAlgorithm.KMeansYinyang,\n                // OptimizationTolerance = 1e-7f, // default 1e-7f\n                NumberOfThreads = 8,  // default 8                \n                // MaximumNumberOfIterations = 1000\n            };\n            var pipeline = mlContext.Clustering.Trainers.KMeans(options);\n```\nThe consumed time doesn't change and the CPU load is also low.\n\nIf I reduce e.g. the `MaximumNumberOfIterations` or the `OptimizationTolerance`  I can see an effect on the training time (and on the results).\n\nFor the normalization of the data I use Parallel.For loops and during this loops, I can clearly see that all thread ramp up to ~80% load for a short time. \n\nIf I dig into the code: [KMeansLloydsYinYangTrain.Train](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/aea5651f13e18c4387266e830224abe25f7e9bf1/src/Microsoft.ML.KMeansClustering/KMeansPlusPlusTrainer.cs#L1351)  in every iteration the [chunks should be processes in parallel](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/aea5651f13e18c4387266e830224abe25f7e9bf1/src/Microsoft.ML.KMeansClustering/KMeansPlusPlusTrainer.cs#L1394), right? If I select the maximum of the 8 threads, I would expect that 8 threads should run at max. load.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nI expect that the KMeans training should use the maximum allowed CPU power in order to reduce time.\n\n**Additional context**\nWe compared our C# app with MatLab kMeans with the same data: ML.Net is faster than the MatLab implementation, but if I see that the cpu has 80 % idle time during the training, it could be even faster. ;)\n\n\nThanks,\nMike","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/7477","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"KMeansTrainer.Options NumberOfThreads has no effect?

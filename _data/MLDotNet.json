While there is already support for basic processing steps (tokenization, stop word removal, ...) and sentiment, other, higher-level workloads are not yet supported.\r\n\r\n# Feature request\r\n\r\n- Pre-trained embeddings, like BERT or GloVe, for documents are useful for down-level tasks.\r\n- It'd be even better if there was an easy to use API to tune or train custom models on custom datasets.\r\n\r\n# Use case\r\nIn our specific use case, we develop document classifiers. We only have a limited set of labeled documents to train with. Our plan is to use a pretrained or trained document embeddings, and learn a simple classifier on top, using the labeled documents.\r\n\r\n# Workarounds\r\nThere is already a project that runs BERT as ONNX on top of ML.NET, see https://github.com/GerjanVlot/BERT-ML.NET. I'd like to see this become an official part of ML.NET, with a good API, properly maintained and updated.\r\n\r\n# Outlook\r\nThese models are building-blocks for other features, like entity recognition (#630). Ideally ML.NET would support many more NLP tasks, as listed in https://github.com/microsoft/nlp-recipes#content.

Although [we originally agreed](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5145#issuecomment-632467994) to accept that fringe scenario, this PR fixes that problem, and adds a test for that scenario.\r\n\r\nThis PR also addresses the general problem, that if we add new options to `TextLoader `that need to affect how we parse Single/Doubles, then there was no direct/thread-safe way to make these options affect how `DoubleParser `works... For example, issue #4132 would require adding a new `TextLoader.Option` \"impute\" that needs to affect how `DoubleParser `works. Other case would be the offline suggestion of also adding a `ThousandsMarker` option to be able to parse `10,332.05` or `10.332,05` into `10332.05` depending on that option.\r\n\r\n### General explanation of the PR\r\nWithout this PR the behavior was that `TextLoader.Parser` would use the singleton `TextLoader.ValueCreatorCache.Instance` to get the delegates to parse the fields loaded from a file. In turn, the `ValueCreatorCache` singleton would have gotten those delegates from the singleton `Conversion.Instance`, whose methods for parsing text to single/doubles would, then, call static methods in `DoubleParser`.\r\n\r\n**I am assuming that the only reason to have both `ValueCreatorCache` and `Conversion `follow the singleton pattern was for performance reasons, so that they didn't have to create the delegates every time somewhere in the code their instances were needed**\r\n\r\nWith this PR:\r\n1. I created a new `DoubleParser.OptionFlags` enum that is used by `TextLoader`, and gets propagated through `ValueCreatorCache `up to `Conversion `in order to call the static `DoubleParser `methods with the correct options.\r\n2. I added code to `ValueCreatorCache `and `Conversion `to let them create other instances besides its default instance. Most of the codebase would still use their default instance, so this PR doesn't affect performance or behavior there. It's only in `TextLoader`, and only in the case when using custom options for `DoubleParser`, that a custom instance of `ValueCreatorCache `and `Conversion `gets created. So then performance would only be somewhat affected when creating those instances for that particular case. To have minimum impact in performance, I also added a `ConcurrentDictionary `to hold the `_customInstances `of `ValueCreatorCache `(i.e. those which were created using non-default `DoubleParser.OptionFlags`)... this way, when using custom options, the custom instance of `ValueCreatorCache `and Conversion would only be created once, and would be reused afterwards.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5154","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Created DoubleParser.OptionFlags to be used by TextLoader\" (#5154)"},{"Id":"623733113","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-23T20:08:35","Actor":"dcostea","Number":"5156","RawContent":null,"Title":"CustomMappingEstimator Exportable to ONNX?","State":"open","Body":"### Question\r\n\r\n- **Will be CustomMappingEstimator exportable to ONNX in the future?**\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/5156","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"CustomMappingEstimator Exportable to ONNX?\" (#5156)"},{"Id":"623665093","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-23T13:52:11","Actor":"shywa","Number":"5155","RawContent":null,"Title":"Application crashes inside Docker containing when using .Fit()","State":"open","Body":"When creating a model for a recommender system that uses MatrixFactorization, the Docker Container crashes on an Ubuntu server without further notice.\r\n\r\nThe only note in the kernel log is\r\n`kernel: [12922.080806] traps: dotnet[30957] trap invalid opcode ip:7f07d81b5efc sp:7ffdc5965110 error:0 in libMatrixFactorizationNative.so[7f07d81a5000+2a000]`\r\n\r\nIn the local version the recommender system and the training of the model are working.\r\n\r\n### System information\r\n\r\n- **OS version/distro**:\r\nUbuntu 18.04.4 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-101-generic x86_64)\r\n- **.NET Version (eg., dotnet --info)**: \r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 3.1.4\r\n  Commit:  0c2e69caa6\r\n.NET Core SDKs installed:\r\n  No SDKs were found.\r\n.NET Core runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.4 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.4 [/usr/share/dotnet/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\n- **What did you do?**\r\nStarting training of a new model using matrix factorization\r\n- **What happened?**\r\nThe application and the Docker Container crash without further message or exception.\r\n- **What did you expect?**\r\nTraining of a new model or at least an exception\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n\r\n#### Implementation:\r\n```\r\nLog.Information(\"Extracting train data...\");\r\nvar trainingData = GetDataView(trainData);\r\n\r\nvar options = new MatrixFactorizationTrainer.Options\r\n{\r\n    MatrixColumnIndexColumnName = UserIdEncoding,\r\n    MatrixRowIndexColumnName = MusicIdEncoding,\r\n    LabelColumnName = \"Label\",\r\n    NumberOfIterations = 20,\r\n    ApproximationRank = 100,\r\n    //Quiet = false\r\n};\r\nLog.Information(\"Setting Matrix Factorization\");\r\nvar trainingPipeline = trainingData.Transformer.Append(\r\n    MLContext.Recommendation().Trainers.MatrixFactorization(options));\r\n\r\nLog.Information(\"Starting training...\");\r\nITransformer trainedModel = trainingPipeline.Fit(trainingData.DataView);\r\n\r\nLog.Information(\"Saving model...\");\r\nMLContext.Model.Save(trainedModel, trainingData.DataView.Schema, ModelPath);\r\n\r\nLog.Information(\"Extracting test data...\"); ;\r\nvar testingData = GetDataView(testData);\r\n\r\nLog.Information(\"Starting model testing...\");\r\nvar testingTransform = trainedModel.Transform(testingData.DataView);\r\n\r\nLog.Information(\"Evaluating model\");\r\nreturn MLContext.Recommendation().Evaluate(testingTransform);\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Container Logs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[13:45:25 Information]\r\nPreparing prediction Model\r\n\r\n[13:45:25 Information]\r\nStarting Model Training...\r\n\r\n[13:45:25 Information]\r\nExtracting train data...\r\n\r\n[13:45:25 Information]\r\nSetting Matrix Factorization\r\n\r\n[13:45:25 Information]\r\nStarting training...\r\n\r\nWarning: insufficient blocks may slow down the trainingprocess (4*nr_threads^2+1 blocks is suggested)\r\nWarning: insufficient blocks may slow down the trainingprocess (4*nr_threads^2+1 blocks is suggested)\r\n--> Application crash\r\n```\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/5155","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Application crashes inside Docker containing when using .Fit()\" (#5155)"},{"Id":"621419479","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-22T22:01:37","Actor":"mstfbl","Number":"5145","RawContent":null,"Title":"Added decimal marker option in TextLoader","State":"closed","Body":"This PR adds the decimal marker option in TextLoader, so that cultures where a comma is the decimal marker (as in 3,5 = 3.5 * 10^1) can use their appropriate datasets.

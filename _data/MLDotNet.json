For other models (created against the same learning data) calculating PFI takes just a couple of seconds.\n\n**To Reproduce**\nRun the attached program.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nI would expect PFI to complete in a timely fashion. Or at least provide a mechanism to monitor the progress of PFI calculation with the ability to cancel it.\n\n**Screenshots, Code, Sample Projects**\nThe attached program contains two regression models created using AutoML, and a set of data used to create the two models. The program first calculates PFI against the first model which takes just a couple of seconds.

Whilst it is possible to loop to perform this function or chain multiple calls it does not seem like that would be a very efficient way of doing things compared to an \"under the hood\" implementation that could better optimise for performance.\n\nAn example of such functionality can be seen with R's `rbindlist()` function in the `data.table` library that will concatenate many large datasets efficiently. It also allows for matching by column names and filling of missing values, although that would not be needed in an initial implementation.\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/7332","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add efficient way of concatenating multiple DataFrame objects\" (#7332)"},{"Id":"2720944523","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-12-09T16:18:37","Actor":"github-actions[bot]","Number":"7330","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/4.0] Moved SpecialTokens assignment after the modification to avoid \"Collection Modified\" error","State":"closed","Body":"Backport of #7328 to release/4.0\r\n\r\n/cc @tarekgh @shaltielshmid\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nUsers of the BERT Tokenizer who provide a custom list of special tokens during tokenizer creation may encounter exceptions if the lowercasing option is enabled.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThis has been manually tested, with new tests added, and all regression tests have passed successfully.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nLow.

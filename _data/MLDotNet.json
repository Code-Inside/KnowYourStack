Therefor I have created a function:\r\n```csharp\r\nprivate static void EvaluateModel(MLContext mlContext, ITransformer trainedModel, IDataView testData)\r\n{\r\n    var predictedData = trainedModel.Transform(testData);\r\n\r\n    var metrics = mlContext.BinaryClassification.EvaluateNonCalibrated(predictedData, \"target\", \"Score\", \"PredictedLabel\");\r\n\r\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Accurecy: {metrics.Accuracy: 0.###}\");\r\n    Console.WriteLine($\"---------------------------\");\r\n    Console.WriteLine($\"Confusion Matrix\");\r\n    Console.WriteLine(metrics.ConfusionMatrix.GetFormattedConfusionTable());\r\n    Console.WriteLine();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Run `mlnet classification --dataset \"./FILE_PATH/FILE_NAME.csv\" --label-col 11 --has-header true --train-time 60`\r\n2. Add to `SampleClassification.training.cs` the function `EvaluateModel`\r\n3. Adjust the already existing `Train` function by\r\n4. run `dotnet run`\r\n5. Error: `An unhandled exception of type 'System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException' occurred in Microsoft.ML.Data.dll: 'Schema mismatch for score column 'Score': expected Single, got Vector<Single, 2>'`\r\n\r\nHere is the adjusted train function:\r\n```csharp\r\npublic static void Train(string outputModelPath, string inputDataFilePath = RetrainFilePath, char separatorChar = RetrainSeparatorChar, bool hasHeader = RetrainHasHeader)\r\n{\r\n    var mlContext = new MLContext();\r\n\r\n    var data = LoadIDataViewFromFile(mlContext, inputDataFilePath, separatorChar, hasHeader);\r\n    var splitedData = mlContext.Data.TrainTestSplit(data, 0.2, null, 0);\r\n    var model = RetrainModel(mlContext, splitedData.TrainSet);\r\n    EvaluateModel(mlContext, model, data);\r\n    SaveModel(mlContext, model, data, outputModelPath);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI would expect the code to work since the Score is something which ML.NET creates. **It seems like it expects the score to be a sinle value while its a compex vector.**\r\n\r\n**Screenshots, Code, Sample Projects**\r\nRepo: https://github.com/muhamedkarajic/csharp-mldotnet-heart-diseases\r\nJust run the project using IDE or cli command: `dotnet run`.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI ahve found that I am supposed to use`EvaluateNonCalibrated` instead of `Evaluate`. Have similar when using `Evaluate` its says that its missing Predictions. Error in that case `Probability column 'Probability' not found (Parameter 'schema')`. \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/7130","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"ML.NET can't add Evaluate logic into pipeline\" (#7130)"},{"Id":"2243822616","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-16T00:58:56","Actor":"yueyinqiu","Number":"7129","RawContent":null,"Title":"Is there an equivalent to pandas' get_dummies, in Microsoft.Data.Analysis?","State":"closed","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/7129","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Is there an equivalent to pandas' get_dummies, in Microsoft.Data.Analysis?\" (#7129)"},{"Id":"2242316679","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-14T19:06:12","Actor":"tarekgh","Number":"7128","RawContent":null,"Title":"Tokenizer's APIs Update","State":"open","Body":"Updating the Tokenizer's APIs:\r\n- Simplifying the APIs by merging the `Model` abstraction into the `Tokenizer` abstracted class.\r\n- Adding overloads to work with spans.\r\n- doing some clean up optimization and adding more tests.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/7128","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Tokenizer's APIs Update\" (#7128)"},{"Id":"2242069777","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-14T09:41:24","Actor":"80LevelElf","Number":"7127","RawContent":null,"Title":"Regression FairLearn with AutoML?","State":"open","Body":"At this moment we have a FairLearn extension method only for Binary Classification - SetBinaryClassificationMetricWithFairLearn method.\r\n\r\nBut during the code ML.net also have Regression Metric FairLearn support - https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/main/src/Microsoft.ML.Fairlearn/Metrics/FairlearnMetricCatalog.cs\r\n\r\nIs it possible to use FairLearn with regression via AutoML?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/7127","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Regression FairLearn with AutoML?\" (#7127)"},{"Id":"2237275563","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-11T09:17:22","Actor":"markbeij","Number":"7126","RawContent":null,"Title":"Create HTML from C# in Jupyter","State":"open","Body":"I hope someone here can help me with this..

This duplication of responsibilities is very confusing and absolutely not straightforward. More over, it is slow, as instead of only reading values, ApplyElementwise writes function results into into memory, also it converts read only columns to editable (and that again involves memory copy). So in some circumstances memory can be excessively copied even twice.\r\n2) Legacy method requires to provide function, that takes into account null values - this is not userfriendly. For working with Nulls there are already FillNulls and DropNulls methods.

This enhancement enables the retrieval of indices even within pre-tokenized unit strings passed to the Model.

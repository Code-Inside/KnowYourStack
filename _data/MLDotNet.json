Please describe.**\r\n\r\nI'm using an ONNX model via `ApplyOnnxModel` and some pre-processing (which is really fast!), but I'd like it to use the OpenVINO execution provider instead of just the CPU.  \r\n\r\nWe are maxing out the CPU and not hitting a high enough framerate with just the CPU.  CUDA with `gpuDeviceId` is not an option due to hardware limitations.\r\n\r\nI can't figure out a way to make the ONNX Runtime called by ML.NET actually use the OpenVINO execution provider.  Is there something simple I'm missing?\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nI'd like the ONNX Runtime used by ML.NET to allow OpenVINO as an execution provider.  Maybe that's in the `ApplyOnnxModel` options as something like `OnnxRuntime = OnnxRuntimes.OpenVINO`, `OnnxRuntime = OnnxRuntimes.CUDA`, or `OnnxRuntime = OnnxRuntimes.oneDNN`, etc.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nI can run OpenVINO using the ONNX Runtime Nuget packages built with OpenVINO using `AppendExecutionProvider_OpenVINO`, but the pre-processing is much slower and the level of abstraction is way lower than I'd like (making the pipeline harder to manage).  The inference runs at least 2x faster on the GPU though, so I want to use the GPU via that runtime.\r\n\r\nI've tried dropping in all the onnxruntime/openvino dlls to the executable directory to see if it uses those at runtime, but no luck.  Do I need to do a custom build of ML.NET?\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI can provide some more source code or examples if that's helpful, but I think it's more of a concept question than code question.\r\n\r\nThis is a great project and I appreciate everyone that's working on it.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/6264","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Does the OpenVINO execution provider for ONNX Runtime work in ML.NET?\" (#6264)"},{"Id":"1317122342","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-28T18:19:51","Actor":"michaelgsharp","Number":"6259","RawContent":null,"Title":"Don't need label column for inference TextClassification.","State":"closed","Body":"Makes the TextClassification transformer save/load the label metadata so that we can use the transformer scope to remove the need for the label column during inferencing.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/6259","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Don't need label column for inference TextClassification.\" (#6259)"},{"Id":"1321299991","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-28T18:06:10","Actor":"tarekgh","Number":"6263","RawContent":null,"Title":"Method not found: 'Void Module.train()'.","State":"open","Body":"This [issue](https://github.com/dotnet/TorchSharp/issues/666) is originally reported by @drGarbinsky in TorchSharp repo and ported here. \r\n\r\nI'm currently trying to get the same running from this page: [devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-the-ml-dotnet-text-classification-api-preview](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-the-ml-dotnet-text-classification-api-preview/)\r\nworking with:\r\ndotnet: 7.0.100-preview.6.22352.1\r\nMicrosoft.ML Version=\"2.0.0-preview.22313.1\"\r\nMicrosoft.ML.TorchSharp Version=\"0.20.0-preview.22313.1\"\r\nTorchSharp-cpu Version=\"0.97.0\"\r\n\r\nWSL ubuntu: 20.04.3 LTS\r\n\r\ncode:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nusing Microsoft.ML;\r\nusing Microsoft.ML.TorchSharp;\r\n\r\n// Initialize MLContext\r\nvar mlContext = new MLContext();\r\n\r\n// Load your data\r\nvar reviews = new[]\r\n{\r\nnew {Text = \"This is a bad steak\", Sentiment = \"Negative\"},\r\nnew {Text = \"I really like this restaurant\", Sentiment = \"Positive\"}\r\n};\r\n\r\nvar reviewsDV = mlContext.Data.LoadFromEnumerable(reviews);\r\n\r\n//Define your training pipeline\r\nvar pipeline =\r\nmlContext.Transforms.Conversion.MapValueToKey(\"Label\", \"Sentiment\")\r\n.Append(mlContext.MulticlassClassification.Trainers.TextClassification(numberOfClasses: 2, sentence1ColumnName: \"Text\"))\r\n.Append(mlContext.Transforms.Conversion.MapKeyToValue(\"PredictedLabel\"));\r\n\r\n// Train the model\r\nvar model = pipeline.Fit(reviewsDV);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n@KernAlan wrote:\r\n\r\nI'm experiencing the same issue right now.\r\n\r\n@JReed221 wrote:\r\n\r\nI am experiencing this issue as well\r\n\r\n@drGarbinsky wrote:\r\n\r\nI've noticed that this [notebook ](https://github.com/dotnet/csharp-notebooks/blob/main/machine-learning/E2E-Text-Classification-API-with-Yelp-Dataset.ipynb?rgh-link-date=2022-07-27T19%3A30%3A45Z)references a newer version of the packages but I am unable to locate them\r\n\r\n> #i \"nuget:[pkgs.dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_packaging/MachineLearning/nuget/v3/index.json](https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_packaging/MachineLearning/nuget/v3/index.json)\"\r\n> #r \"nuget:Microsoft.ML,2.0.0-preview.22324.1\"\r\n> #r \"nuget:Microsoft.ML.TorchSharp,0.20.0-preview.22324.1\"\r\n> #r \"nuget:TorchSharp-cpu,0.96.7\"\r\n> #r \"nuget:Microsoft.Data.Analysis,0.20.0-preview.22324.1\"\r\n\r\nI have also reproduced this issue within the nightly docker image so I don't think it is an environment issue\r\n\r\n\r\n@drGarbinsky wrote\r\n\r\nI was able to work around the issue by rolling back package versions:\r\n\r\n```Xml\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"libtorch-cpu-linux-x64\" Version=\"1.11.0.1\" />\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.Analysis\" Version=\"0.20.0-preview.22313.1\" />\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.ML\" Version=\"2.0.0-preview.22313.1\" />\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.ML.TorchSharp\" Version=\"0.20.0-preview.22313.1\" />\r\n<PackageReference Include=\"TorchSharp-cpu\" Version=\"0.96.3\" />\r\n```\r\n\r\n@JReed221 wrote\r\n\r\nthat worked! thank you!\r\n\r\n@NiklasGustafsson wrote\r\n\r\nI believe that this is likely due to the fact that there was a breaking change made to Module.train() -- the previous version did not take an optional bool, which the Pytorch version does.

Please describe.\r\nI have a transformed `IDataView` with prediction (`Score`) column, input columns and one-hot encoded columns (working with regression task). I want to save only prediction and input values to a database table (i.e., I want to be able to choose which columns to save). \r\n\r\nMy main obstacle seems to be not having a class ([POCO][1]) representing the structure of the db model, but the main issue (trying to avoid the [XY problem][5]) seems to be not having a convenient way to save it to a table (like [there is for a text file][7] for example).\r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you'd like\r\nAn ideal experience would be something like\r\n```c#\r\nIDataView.SaveToDatabase(/*db connection/connection string*/, /*list of columns*/)\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```c#\r\nmlContext.Data.SaveToDatabase(IDataView, /*db connection/connection string*/, /*list of columns*/)\r\n```\r\nand possibly without loading the data into memory to be able to handle large data sets.\r\n\r\nA less ideal solution would be create an extension to `DataFrame` for the same functionality - something similar to [pandas.DataFrame.to_sql][4]. So the user experience would be:\r\n```c#\r\nIDataView predictions = trainedModel.Transform(...);\r\nvar df = predictions.ToDataFrame(...);\r\ndf.ToSql(/*db connection/connection string*/, /*list of columns*/, /*possibly other parameters*/)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditional convenience (although this could be considered a completely separate feature):\r\nMy `IDataView` is transformed using one-hot encoding, but I want to write the original input values to a db table. I couldn't leave the same column names for the output after transformation (i.e., I had to do `new InputOutputColumnPair(col.Name + \"_onehot\", col.Name)`) because the input columns would then be hidden, and I couldn't easily get their value. It would be nice to have a way to do this without renaming the transformed columns i.e., something like\r\n```c#\r\nIDataView predictions = ...\r\nvar columns = predictions.InputColumns + prediction.ScoreColumn \r\n/* returns a list of columns, where \r\nInputColumns are the original columns without transformation, \r\nScoreColumn are the predicted values, \r\nThe plus operator means appending to the list \r\n*/\r\npredictions.SaveToDb(... , columns)\r\n```\r\nI am aware of the [SchemaAnnotationsExtensions.GetSlotNames][6] but that doesn't seem to cover my use-case conveniently.\r\n\r\n## Describe alternatives you've considered\r\n<details> \r\n  <summary>1. Create an `IEnumerable` from `IDataView` and write that to the DB</summary>\r\n\r\nI used \r\n```c#\r\nIEnumerable<SomeType> predictionsEnumerable = \r\n    mlContext.Data.CreateEnumerable<SomeType>(predictions, reuseRowObject: true);\r\n```\r\nin order to try and write it to a DB table. \r\nFirst problem is that I don't have the `SomeType`. I tried using `dynamic` or `object`, but neither of them work - possibly related to\r\n- #3829\r\n- #5895 (although this one is for creating the IDataView, which wasn't a problem for me)\r\n(probably unrelevant) I also tried reflection but I didn't manage to make anything work .\r\n\r\nSecond problem is that even when I have the `SomeType`, I only managed to write it with Dapper converting the `IEnumerable` to a list.

Convert `IDataView` to `DataFrame` and write that to DB</summary>\r\n\r\nI used \r\n```c#\r\nvar df = predictions.ToDataFrame(long.MaxValue, columns.ToArray());\r\n```\r\nto create a `DataFrame` and tried to write that to the DB. I didn't manage to find a nice solution.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>3. Manual type mapping</summary>\r\n\r\nTried to manually check the column type and get its value with the appropriate `ValueGetter<>`, to later convert it to a row and save it to a db table. I later saw that `.ToDataFrame(...)` does something similar, although much better in every aspect. Still, I failed to use the result  in combination with Dapper to insert it into a table (in my case, I failed to make a use of the `rows` list). This also takes too much memory (didn't go too much into details, but around 2.5GB (half of it is \"just my code\") was on the heap, and 5.1GB of RAM taken). Compared to converting it to a `DataFrame` which takes just 1.1GB of RAM, (didn't check the heap). I assume my solution could be optimized, but that's not the point here.\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n\r\ncolumns = // list of columns\r\nIDataView predictions = ...\r\n\r\nIEnumerable<DataViewSchema.Column> dvColumns = columns.Select(col => predictions.Schema[col]);\r\nIList<object> rows = new List<object>();\r\nusing (var cursor = predictions.GetRowCursor(dvColumns))\r\n{\r\n    Dictionary<string, ValueGetter<ReadOnlyMemory<char>>> colGettersString = new();\r\n    Dictionary<string, ValueGetter<float>> colGettersSingle = new();\r\n    foreach (var col in dvColumns)\r\n    {\r\n        var colType = col.Type.RawType;\r\n        if (col.Type.RawType == typeof(ReadOnlyMemory<char>))\r\n        {\r\n            colGettersString.Add(col.Name, cursor.GetGetter<ReadOnlyMemory<char>>(col));\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (col.Type.RawType == typeof(float))\r\n        {\r\n            colGettersSingle.Add(col.Name, cursor.GetGetter<float>(col));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    while (cursor.MoveNext())\r\n    {\r\n        ExpandoObject colValues = new(); // could use a regular dictionary here\r\n        foreach (var col in dvColumns)\r\n        {\r\n            ReadOnlyMemory<char> colValueString = default;\r\n            float colValueFloat = default;\r\n\r\n            if (colGettersString.ContainsKey(col.Name))\r\n                colGettersString[col.Name](ref colValueString);\r\n            else if (colGettersSingle.ContainsKey(col.Name))\r\n                colGettersSingle[col.Name](ref colValueFloat);\r\n\r\n            string colValueStringString = colValueString.ToString();\r\n            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(colValueStringString))\r\n                colValues.TryAdd(col.Name, colValueFloat);\r\n            else\r\n                colValues.TryAdd(col.Name, colValueStringString);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        rows.Add(colValues);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>4. Some other ideas</summary>\r\n\r\n**Using 3. and converting to JSON**\r\nThis seems to be like one of the workarounds, which I didn't complete. The idea is to take `rows` list from 3. and convert it to JSON. Then, manipulate the JSON through SQL, which I gave up on as it seems too complicated. This also uses more memory as the JSON can be a large string with a lot of data.\r\n\r\n**Using reflection Emit**\r\nCreate a class dynamically and use that to create a db model class, to be used in `CreateEnumerable`.

There is also some deadlock or infinte loop etc. which, when inspected, shows lots of threads doing some sub-tasks of clustering but I could not find the root cause yet.\r\n\r\nAfter I set NumberOfThreads = 2, I see much smaller spike on CPU consumpition (in debug) and much better performance with 16 threads from the main loop. I still only reach about 18% CPU consumption, though, but it may be due to other issues. I can not yet confirm the deadlocks (or infinite loops etc) are gone.\r\n\r\nMy suspect is that for whichever reason NumberOfThreads = 1 may be considered same as NumberOfThread=null (automatic). \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/6252","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"KMeansTrainer can not be set single-threaded (NumberOfThreads=1)\" (#6252)"},{"Id":"1288383209","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-14T08:00:22","Actor":"IzzyHibbert","Number":"6240","RawContent":null,"Title":"Could not load file or assembly 'System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe, Version=4.0.4.1","State":"closed","Body":"System Info :\r\n - OS : Win 2019\r\n - ML.NET Version: 1.5, tried already 1.7.1\r\n - .NET Version: 4.7.2\r\n\r\nIssue : \r\nI am trying to use ML in my .NET 4.7.2 class library project. \r\nI imported ML with Nuget, created the model, and when I use the dll I get the following error :\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem.Reflection.TargetInvocationException: Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation. ---> System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException: Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation. ---> System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException: Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation. ---> System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException: Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation. ---> System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException: Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation. ---> System.IO.FileLoadException: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe, Version=4.0.4.1, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' or one of its dependencies.

I have tried appending column names with ':0' and ':1'(e.g. detected_classes:0) and changing the output tensor types (e.g. for detected_classes, change long to long[]), both to no avail. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI expect all detected classes and their corresponding scores to be returned. \r\n\r\n**Screenshots, Code, Sample Projects**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82560572/178418379-6fa91a35-5518-47b6-af35-c5f2fc2c89f4.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82560572/178418911-2ffebbb3-aa80-48ca-890f-eec5362cc251.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82560572/178419006-30a660f7-0f7e-487b-b6a9-77b0ccc928ef.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82560572/178419132-3d1d4a47-7514-4b63-96ad-a63df6314c6b.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82560572/178419196-bf0bfe97-fd83-4dec-aa61-50f9beb13b61.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82560572/178419998-148f837e-8884-4643-9217-7101974259ea.png)\r\n<img width=\"766\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-07-12 160630\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82560572/178420335-968c8ae3-6dbd-42b9-9507-027de7675011.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/6250","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Prediction engine outputs only one class\" (#6250)"},{"Id":"1299623466","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-11T17:20:59","Actor":"wangLinWuYing","Number":"6248","RawContent":null,"Title":"Tensorflow's hardware CPu requirements, such as the minimum REQUIRED CPu configuration, do not use the GPU ","State":"closed","Body":"Tensorflow's hardware CPu requirements, such as the minimum REQUIRED CPu configuration, do not use the GPU ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/6248","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Tensorflow's hardware CPu requirements, such as the minimum REQUIRED CPu configuration, do not use the GPU \" (#6248)"},{"Id":"1300656056","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-07-11T12:40:54","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"6249","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:97926d79-6b8b-4d32-c8db-08d9d479971c)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: 97926d79-6b8b-4d32-c8db-08d9d479971c\r\n- **Build**: 20220722.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: July 22, 2022 2:57:33 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 11672d906390046e77a34b6406d9e02229fd7e45\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

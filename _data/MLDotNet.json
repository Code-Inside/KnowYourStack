At end of the trial, I want to log parameters and trainer used. I also want to get global feature index. My code* for global feature index relies on knowing which trainer is used. \r\n\r\nFor now, I intend to \"hack\" it this way. I believe this will be adequate for my need (not yet tested):\r\nvar pipelineString = pipeline.ToString(experimentResults.TrialSettings.Parameter);\r\nif(pipelineString.Contains(\"FastTree\")\r\n\r\nHowever, it would be good to have documentation or implementation, if needed, to read the parameters in a structured format. I have not looked at the source, so maybe it just needs a sample or documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*my code for GFI uses this code, and I have different lines for each tree trainer. If there are better ways it would make my life easier...\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft.ML.Data.TransformerChain<Microsoft.ML.IPredictionTransformer<object>> transformerchain = (model as Microsoft.ML.Data.TransformerChain<Microsoft.ML.IPredictionTransformer<object>>);\r\n                    Microsoft.ML.Data.BinaryPredictionTransformer<**Microsoft.ML.Calibrators.CalibratedModelParametersBase<Microsoft.ML.Trainers.FastTree.FastTreeBinaryModelParameters, Microsoft.ML.Calibrators.PlattCalibrator>**>\r\nlastTransformer = (BinaryPredictionTransformer<CalibratedModelParametersBase<FastTreeBinaryModelParameters, PlattCalibrator>>)transformerchain.LastTransformer;\r\n\r\nlastTransformer.Model.SubModel.GetFeatureWeights(ref weights);\r\nfloat[] weightsValues = weights.DenseValues().ToArray();\r\n\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/6651","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"AutoML 2.0: How to get trainer used for best model\" (#6651)"},{"Id":"1694593223","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-03T18:36:00","Actor":"torronen","Number":"6648","RawContent":null,"Title":"AutoML 2.0: Distributes learning / potential \"hack\" using checkpoints CSV on a network drive?","State":"open","Body":"I could not find docs or plans about distributed learning.

Would there a tuner that would allow me to use it for distributed tuning?

Please describe.**\r\nWe are currently adapting a package approval workflow, where packages are approved or blocked based on certain criteria. One very important criterion is the package's license. There is a list of approved licenses (like MIT, Apache, BSD, ...) and a list of licenses that can not be used (like GPL).\r\n\r\nAlthough the Microsoft.ML Nuget packages are under MIT license, it's hard to auto-approve them, because they use an embedded license file instead of an SPDX tag (https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2-draft/SPDX-license-list/). As a result, the license does not show up in the package's metadata (compare e.g. the \"About\" page of [https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ML) with [https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.SqlClient), where the latter clearly states the package's license, while Microsoft.ML does not).\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nWould you consider using an SPDX license expression? Basically, all that is needed is replacing the line\r\n`<PackageLicenseFile>LICENSE.txt</PackageLicenseFile>`\r\nwith\r\n`<PackageLicenseExpression>MIT</PackageLicenseExpression>`\r\nin all *.csproj or *.props files (or whatever mechanism generates the corresponding *.nuspec file). The LICENSE file can still remain in the package, just the metadata would change. The corresponding .nuspec file should then change the line\r\n`<license type=\"file\">LICENSE.txt</license>`\r\nto\r\n`<license type=\"expression\">MIT</license>`\r\n\r\nThis would be a huge help for us, because with embedded license files we have to manually check and approve every single version of every package.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nThe alternative would be for us to download every package, manually check the context of each embedded LICENSE file, make sure that it is in fact an approved license, and then manually allow the package. This would have to be done for every release of every package without an SPDX license tags.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThe [dotnet / runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime) repo seems to use already [use license expressions](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/0be256e71009beaa0e01591c4115d92d68b93a95/Directory.Build.props#L333) (and apparently use a an additional `<LicenseFile>`).\r\nThe [microsoft / MSBuildSdks](https://github.com/microsoft/MSBuildSdks/issues/312) repo switched to license expressions about two years ago, following the recommendations provided in Microsoft's [.nuspec reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuspec#license).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/6645","RelatedDescription":"Open issue

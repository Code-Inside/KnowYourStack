Also, the test is disabled for some reason that seems unrelated to the `codegen` command. So I'm simply removing that variable. As I guess it wasn't meant to use the baseline I'm deleting anyway (notice that the baseline got introduced in #1654 as I've mentioned, but the `CheckFastTreeParallelInterface` was introduced in the first commit of the ML.NET repo, and it already had the unused variable).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5172","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Removed unused CodeGen Baseline\" (#5172)"},{"Id":"625505339","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-27T18:59:39","Actor":"pthinh14","Number":"5170","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unable to load DLL 'tensorflow' with published WPF app","State":"closed","Body":"### System information\r\n\r\n- **OS version/distro**: Window 10\r\n- **.NET Version (eg., dotnet --info)**: .NET framework 4.7.2\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\n- **What did you do?** I'm trying sample code for image classification using MLNet. \r\n- **What happened?** Everything works fine in development environment which means that I can use model to predict label of images.

I trained him. I evaluated it on a test dataset.\r\n\r\nI displayed the result using the `Evaluate()` function.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic static void TrainTest(....){\r\n..... // train and test method\r\nvar metrics = mlContext.Regression.Evaluate(predictions, \"Label\", \"Score\");\r\nDumpMetrics(name, metrics);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic static void DumpMetrics(string name, RegressionMetrics metrics)\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine();\r\n            Console.WriteLine($\"*************************************************\");\r\n            Console.WriteLine($\"*       Model quality metrics evaluation         \");\r\n            Console.WriteLine($\"*       \" + name);\r\n            Console.WriteLine($\"*------------------------------------------------\");\r\n            Console.WriteLine($\"*       R2 Score:      {metrics.RSquared:0.###}\");\r\n            Console.WriteLine($\"*       RMS loss:      {metrics.RootMeanSquaredError:#.###}\");\r\n            Console.WriteLine($\"*       MAE loss:      {metrics.MeanAbsoluteError:#.###}\");\r\n            Console.WriteLine($\"*************************************************\");\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n- **What happened?**\r\n\r\n```bash \r\n*************************************************\r\n*       Model quality metrics evaluation         \r\n*       \r\n*------------------------------------------------\r\n*       R2 Score:      0,882\r\n*       RMS loss:      30,57\r\n*       MAE loss:      20,03\r\n*************************************************\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the RMSE is: `30,57`.\r\n\r\n- **What did you expect?**\r\n\r\nI saved the output of the model to a CSV file.\r\n\r\nI used the `mean_squared_error` function from the Python scikit-learn library and got a completely different value for RMSE. \r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nimport math\r\ndf =pd.read_csv('test.csv',decimal=',',sep=';')\r\nprint(math.sqrt(mean_squared_error(df['label'],df['prediction'])))\r\n```\r\nThe result is: \r\n\r\n```bash \r\n125.30721032995426\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef rmse(predictions, targets):\r\n    return np.sqrt(((predictions - targets) ** 2).mean())\r\nrmse(df['prediction'].values,df['label'].values)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result is: \r\n```bash\r\n125.30721032995426\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo my questions are: does the value found in the object returned by the `Evaluate` function apply the following formula between  `target` and `prediction`? If yes, why the results are different ? \r\n\r\n![RMSE](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=%5Csqrt%7B%28%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bn%7D%29%5Csum_%7Bi%3D1%7D%5E%7Bn%7D%28y_%7Bi%7D%20-%20x_%7Bi%7D%29%5E%7B2%7D%7D&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0)\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n\r\nPlease paste or attach the code or logs or traces that would be helpful to diagnose the issue you are reporting.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/5164","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"How RMSE is calculated ? \" (#5164)"},{"Id":"623380398","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-26T05:49:42","Actor":"harishsk","Number":"5153","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updated doc comments and renamed public types","State":"closed","Body":"@gvashishtha Left a few doc comments on the earlier anomaly and time series PRs.

Although [we originally agreed](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5145#issuecomment-632467994) to accept that fringe scenario, this PR fixes that problem, and adds a test for that scenario.\r\n\r\nThis PR also addresses the general problem, that if we add new options to `TextLoader `that need to affect how we parse Single/Doubles, then there was no direct/thread-safe way to make these options affect how `DoubleParser `works... For example, issue #4132 would require adding a new `TextLoader.Option` \"impute\" that needs to affect how `DoubleParser `works. Other case would be the offline suggestion of also adding a `ThousandsMarker` option to be able to parse `10,332.05` or `10.332,05` into `10332.05` depending on that option.\r\n\r\n### General explanation of the PR\r\nWithout this PR the behavior was that `TextLoader.Parser` would use the singleton `TextLoader.ValueCreatorCache.Instance` to get the delegates to parse the fields loaded from a file. In turn, the `ValueCreatorCache` singleton would have gotten those delegates from the singleton `Conversion.Instance`, whose methods for parsing text to single/doubles would, then, call static methods in `DoubleParser`.\r\n\r\n**I am assuming that the only reason to have both `ValueCreatorCache` and `Conversion `follow the singleton pattern was for performance reasons, so that they didn't have to create the delegates every time somewhere in the code their instances were needed**\r\n\r\nWith this PR:\r\n1. I created a new `DoubleParser.OptionFlags` enum that is used by `TextLoader`, and gets propagated through `ValueCreatorCache `up to `Conversion `in order to call the static `DoubleParser `methods with the correct options.\r\n2. I added code to `ValueCreatorCache `and `Conversion `to let them create other instances besides its default instance. Most of the codebase would still use their default instance, so this PR doesn't affect performance or behavior there. It's only in `TextLoader`, and only in the case when using custom options for `DoubleParser`, that a custom instance of `ValueCreatorCache `and `Conversion `gets created. So then performance would only be somewhat affected when creating those instances for that particular case. To have minimum impact in performance, I also added a `ConcurrentDictionary `to hold the `_customInstances `of `ValueCreatorCache `(i.e. those which were created using non-default `DoubleParser.OptionFlags`)... this way, when using custom options, the custom instance of `ValueCreatorCache `and Conversion would only be created once, and would be reused afterwards.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5154","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Created DoubleParser.OptionFlags to be used by TextLoader\" (#5154)"},{"Id":"621419479","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-22T22:01:37","Actor":"mstfbl","Number":"5145","RawContent":null,"Title":"Added decimal marker option in TextLoader","State":"closed","Body":"This PR adds the decimal marker option in TextLoader, so that cultures where a comma is the decimal marker (as in 3,5 = 3.5 * 10^1) can use their appropriate datasets.

// or en-US\r\nIf a column in the CSV contains on a row a valid date value, \r\nand in a subsequent row appear two or more empty string values, one of which appears in a previous column,\r\nthe column containing a date is not considered as having a date type, but a single/float type.\r\nParsing the date values on that column will fail with an exception.\r\nProbably the same issue appears for boolean columns or other types.\r\nSample CSV:\r\n```\r\n\"Col1\",\"Col2\",\"Col3\",\"Col4\"\r\n\"v1.1\",\"5/7/2017\",\"v3.1\",\"v4.1\"\r\n\"\",\"\",\"v3.2\",\"v4.2\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe column type should considered to be Date type, even if it contains a few empty string values.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots, Code, Sample Projects**\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing Microsoft.Data.Analysis;\r\nusing System.Globalization;\r\n\r\nnamespace DataFrameColumnTypeDetectionBug\r\n{\r\n    internal class Program\r\n    {\r\n        static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            CultureInfo.CurrentCulture = CultureInfo.InvariantCulture;

Set Up ASP.Web API\r\n2. Add an object detection Model => train it etc.\r\n3. Add a controller to use the model\r\n4. Provide an upload function with IFormFile\r\n5. Add using on opening the IFormFileStream\r\n6. Add using for the ModelInput\r\n7. Add a result around the prediction, store the result of precision in that, and close or make a using the output image.\r\n8. Make sure all using's are there and all streams are going to be closed.\r\n9. Optional (Add a lock statement around prediction to make it anytime single-threaded)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nRAM usage for single-threaded usage should go not over 2.5 GB or come down after usage.

Now float is always used when the data is floating point.\n- Allow the user to define NaN in floating point columns data. In R code that we are also using, NA is typically used.\n- Speed improvements if possible.\n- I think there is a problem with defining culture info in the parameter. I have to do:\nThread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = new CultureInfo(\"en-US\"); before the call to LoadCsv to make floating point data with decimal points load correctly (in Sweden).\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Feedback Bot on 8/1/2024, 10:56 PM: \n\n(private comment, text removed)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/7213","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"DataFrame LoadCsv improvements\" (#7213)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2024-09-23T03:30:19.496734Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":578}

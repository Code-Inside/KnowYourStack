Inconsistency of the API is related to types of data returned by arithmetic operations over `PrimitiveColumn<T>` instances and their concrete aliases (like `DoubleDataFrame` or `Int32DataFrameColumn`)\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n```C#\r\nvar left_column = new ByteDataFrameColumn(\"Left\", new byte[] { 1, 2, 3 });\r\nvar right_column = new Int16DataFrameColumn(\"Right\", new short[] { 1, 2, 3 });\r\n\r\nvar sum = left_column.Add + right_column;\r\n```\r\nresults in sum column containing int values.\r\n\r\nThe same code, but referring columns using parent type\r\n```C#\r\nPrimitiveDataFrameColumn<byte> left_column = new ByteDataFrameColumn(\"Left\", new byte[] { 1, 2, 3 });\r\nPrimitiveDataFrameColumn<short> right_column = new Int16DataFrameColumn(\"Right\", new short[] { 1, 2, 3 });\r\n\r\nvar sum = left_column.Add + right_column;\r\n```\r\nresults in sum column containing double values. \r\n\r\n2.  Inaccurate results of aggregated functions. Currently aggregated functions are calculated using the same type as input column, for example for byte column it’s byte type. \r\nAnd\r\n```C#\r\nvar column = new ByteDataFrameColumn(\"Column\", new byte[] { 128, 129 });\r\n\r\nvar sum = column.Sum();\r\nvar mean = column.Mean();\r\n```\r\nresults in sum equals to 1 and mean to 0.5, which is obviously incorrect.\r\n\r\n3. Performance and excessive coping issues are well known and mentioned in  #5663  \r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nProposal is:\r\n\r\n1. to use the common numeric type for the arithmetic output (the smallest numeric type which can accommodate any value of any input). If any input is a floating point type the common numeric type is the widest floating point type among the inputs. Otherwise the common numeric type is integral and is signed if any input is signed.\r\n\r\n2. to return the widest possible type for accumulating aggregation functions (like sum, product and etc). It’s double for floating point types (double, float, Half), long for signed integers (long, int, short, sbyte) and ulong for unsigned integers (ulong, uint, ushort, byte) and input type for other aggregated functions (like min, max, first and etc).\r\n\r\nThis approach is used for example in [Apache Arrow Compute functions](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/cpp/compute.html)\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nImplementation can reuse the low level parts of the future generic TensorPrimitives API, like `IUnaryOperator<T>`, `IBinaryOperator<T>` and their concrete implementations.\r\n\r\nOperators allow to invoke highly efficient vectorized calculations over arguments of the same type. New implementation should extend this functionality by providing efficient vectorized convertors and conversion rules for cases when arguments have different data type.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nI created an example of possible implementation [compute-functions](https://github.com/asmirnov82/compute-functions)\r\nApache Arrow doesn’t have a .Net implementation of Compute Functions I took at as an exercise for the POC. DataFrame follows the same paradigm, so all the ideas can be applied to it as well.\r\n\r\nSo, I extend several operators from TensorPrimitive API to have generic version (this is done to illustrate how future Generic Tensor API can be look like and be used). I also created several OperatorExecutors and Functions classes, that provides rules for argument type conversions for several cases (binary arithmetic calculations and two types of aggregating functions). I also created a list of wideners and convertes that leverage SIMD vectorized calculation as an example","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/6905","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Proposal] DataFrame Arithmetic and Computation API \" (#6905)"},{"Id":"2034549027","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-10T21:52:49","Actor":"MattiaDurli","Number":"6904","RawContent":null,"Title":"Object Detection speed decreased moving from ML.NET 1.7.0 to 3.0","State":"open","Body":"**System Information (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS & Version: Windows 11\r\n - ML.NET Version: ML.NET 1.7.0 and 3.0\r\n - .NET Version: .NET 8\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nI trained my model last year, with ML Model Builder and ML.NET 1.7 with a set of images annotated with VOTT.

The merges.txt and vocab.json can be found here: [https://gist.github.com/shaltielshmid/58b7c1109639eefcd714eb6bfc3eb602](https://gist.github.com/shaltielshmid/58b7c1109639eefcd714eb6bfc3eb602).\r\n\r\nSample python code:\r\n```python\r\nfrom transformers import GPT2Tokenizer\r\ntokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('/path/to/tokenizer')\r\nprint(tokenizer.encode('שלום וברכה')); // [150, 662, 426, 1396]\r\nprint(tokenizer.decode([150, 662, 426, 1396])); // שלום וברכה\r\n```\r\n\r\nSample C# code:\r\n```cs\r\nvar bpe = new Bpe(\"/path/to/vocab.json\", \"/path/to/merges.txt\");\r\nstring phrase = \"שלום וברכה\";\r\nConsole.WriteLine(string.Join(\", \", bpe.Tokenize(phrase).Select(t => t.Id.ToString()))); // 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\r\nstring decoded = Bpe.Decoder.Decode(new List<int> { 150, 662, 426, 1396 }.Select(id => bpe.IdToToken(id)!)); \r\nConsole.WriteLine(decoded); // ×©×ľ×ķ×ĿĠ×ķ×ĳ×¨×Ľ×Ķ\r\n\r\n// with proposed solution from down below\r\nphrase = new string(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(phrase).Select(b => hf_encoder[b]).ToArray());\r\nConsole.WriteLine(string.Join(\", \", bpe.Tokenize(phrase).Select(t => t.Id.ToString()))); // 150, 662, 426, 1396\r\ndecoded = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(decoded.Select(c => (byte)hf_decoder[c]).ToArray());\r\nConsole.WriteLine(decoded); // שלום וברכה\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution**\r\n\r\nCreate a static dictionary in the BPE class, which is initialized once:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nvar hf_encoder = new Dictionary<int, char>();\r\nfor (int c = '!'; c <= '~'; c++) hf_encoder.Add(c, (char)c);\r\nfor (int c = '¡'; c <= '¬'; c++) hf_encoder.Add(c, (char)c);\r\nfor (int c = '®'; c <= 'ÿ'; c++) hf_encoder.Add(c, (char)c);\r\nint n = 0;\r\nfor (int c = 0; c < 256; c++) {\r\n    if (!hf_encoder.ContainsKey(c))\r\n        hf_encoder.Add(c, (char)(256 + n++));\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar hf_decoder = hf_encoder.ToDictionary(kvp => kvp.Value, kvp => kvp.Key);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, in the BPE.cs class in the `Tokenize` function [here](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/main/src/Microsoft.ML.Tokenizers/Model/BPE.cs#L156), add the following check:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nif (_isHFFormat) {\r\n    sequence = new string(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(sequence).Select(b => hf_encoder[b]).ToArray())\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then in the BPEDecoder.cs file, in the `Decode` function [here](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/main/src/Microsoft.ML.Tokenizers/Model/BPEDecoder.cs#L35)\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nstring ret = string.Join(\"\", tokens);\r\nif (_suffix != null)\r\n{\r\n    ret = ret.Replace(_suffix, \" \");\r\n}\r\n\r\nif (_isHFFormat) {\r\n    ret = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(ret.Select(c => (byte)hf_decoder[c]).ToArray())\r\n}\r\n\r\nreturn ret;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould be happy to compile this into a PR, if relevant.\r\n\r\n@luisquintanilla \r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/6901","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Tokenizers] Add support for HuggingFace BPE Tokenizer format\" (#6901)"},{"Id":"2027301365","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-05T23:23:35","Actor":"bruno-garcia","Number":"6900","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add `source link`, `deterministic` build and symbols on release/nuget package","State":"open","Body":"The current publish flow ([as of 3.0.0](https://nuget.info/packages/Microsoft.ML/3.0.0)) isn't following the [NuGet package best practicies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/create-packages/package-authoring-best-practices).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/assets/1633368/5a0b0283-3d9c-4b16-bce8-6daa0101dfd1)\r\n\r\nIdeally it:\r\n1. uses the compiler `deterministic` flag to allow us to match source to the compiled DLLs.\r\n2. publishes a debug symbols package to nuget.org so tools like IDEs and crash reporting services like http://sentry.io can fetch symbols and show line numbers, file paths\r\n3.

When making predictions, all the outputs are the first class even though they should not be. Also the prediction values vary only by a little. Here is an example of two output predictions:\r\n\r\n[1.5047534,  -0.16131932, 0.71119475]\r\n[1.5056, -0.16168906, 0.7110559]\r\n\r\nThis seems odd that there are negative values. So I don't think it is correct from that aspect. I thought it might be because the model was trained on RGBA but the MLContext transform uses ARGB/ABGR/etc. I tried switching the channels of the input images, but this did not help.  Any ideas of what I am doing wrong with my code below?\r\n\r\nThis classification model is almost identical to the model I trained with, except I am using 4 bands instead of 3: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification\r\n\r\nHere is the code for loading the model: \r\n\r\n```\r\nITransformer GetPredictionPipeline(MLContext mlContext)\r\n{\r\nvar pipeline2 = mlContext\r\n.Transforms\r\n// Adjust the image to the required model input size\r\n.ResizeImages(\r\n    inputColumnName: \"sequential_input\",\r\n    imageWidth: 224,\r\n    imageHeight: 224,\r\n    outputColumnName: \"resized\"\r\n)\r\n// Extract the pixels form the image as a 1D float array, but keep them in the same order as they appear in the image.\r\n.Append(mlContext.Transforms.ExtractPixels(\r\n    inputColumnName: \"resized\",\r\n    colorsToExtract: Microsoft.ML.Transforms.Image.ImagePixelExtractingEstimator.ColorBits.All,\r\n    orderOfExtraction: Microsoft.ML.Transforms.Image.ImagePixelExtractingEstimator.ColorsOrder.ARGB,\r\n    outputColumnName: \"sequential_input\",\r\n    scaleImage: 1 / 255f)\r\n)\r\n// Perform the estimation\r\n.Append(mlContext.Transforms.ApplyOnnxModel(\r\n        modelFile: \"./model.onnx\",\r\n        inputColumnName: \"sequential_input\",\r\n        outputColumnName: \"dense_1,\r\n        gpuDeviceId: 0\r\n    )\r\n);\r\n\r\nvar emptyDv = mlContext.Data.LoadFromEnumerable(new OnnxInput[] { });\r\n\r\nvar model = pipeline2.Fit(emptyDv);\r\nreturn model;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy input/output look like this:\r\n```\r\npublic class OnnxInput\r\n{\r\n    public const int ImageWidth = 224;\r\n    public const int ImageHeight = 224;\r\n\r\n    [ColumnName(\"sequential_input\")]\r\n    [ImageType(ImageWidth, ImageHeight)]\r\n    public MLImage Image { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class OnnxOutput\r\n{\r\n    [ColumnName(\"dense_1\")]\r\n    public float[] Output { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, the prediction looks like this:\r\n```\r\nMLContext mlContext = new MLContext();\r\nvar onnxPredictionPipeline = GetPredictionPipeline(mlContext);\r\nvar onnxPredictionEngine = mlContext.Model.CreatePredictionEngine<OnnxInput, OnnxOutput>(onnxPredictionPipeline);\r\n\r\nfor (int j = 0; j < files.Length; j++)\r\n{\r\n    string pngFile = files[i];\r\n\r\n    // Create single instance of sample data from first line of dataset for model input\r\n    var mlImage = MLImage.CreateFromFile(pngFile);\r\n    var testInput = new OnnxInput\r\n    {\r\n        Image = mlImage \r\n    };\r\n    var prediction = onnxPredictionEngine.Predict(testInput);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/6886","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Image clasification not working for onnx model\" (#6886)"},{"Id":"1991547787","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-13T21:53:58","Actor":"anrouxel","Number":"6884","RawContent":null,"Title":"ONNX Named Entity Recognizer #6883 ","State":"open","Body":"Hello,\r\n**Is your feature request related to a problem?

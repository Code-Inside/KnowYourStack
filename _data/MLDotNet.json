Sometimes an anomaly do happens, but with a low sensitivity setting, it may not be a valid alert. With this new option, the SR anomaly detector will allow user to set sensitivity, and output margin for the point according to the sensitivity, so that when you get an an anomaly point, you could judge if it's a valid alert by comparing the value with margin.\r\n### Backward compatibility\r\n\r\nThis change is backward compatible. By default the SR anomaly detector will use AnomalyOnly mode, which have exactly the same intput and output with original method. And the user could also load old saved models with the new detector.\r\n\r\n### Benchmark report\r\n#### 1.

My Data Processing pipeline looks like this:\r\n\r\n` Append(mlContext.Transforms.Text.FeaturizeText(\"FeaturesA\", options, \"Transcript\"))\r\n .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Text.TokenizeIntoWords(\"Tokens\", \"Transcript\"))\r\n .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Text.ApplyWordEmbedding(\"WordEmbeddings\", \"OutputTokens\", WordEmbeddingEstimator.PretrainedModelKind.GloVe50D))\r\n .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Text.ApplyWordEmbedding(\"WordEmbeddings\", WORDVECTOR_PATH, \"Tokens\"))\r\n.Append(mlContext.Transforms.NormalizeMinMax(\"FeaturesA\", \"FeaturesA\"))\r\n.Append(mlContext.Transforms.CopyColumns(\"FeaturesB\", \"WordEmbeddings\"))\r\n.Append(mlContext.Transforms.Concatenate(\"Features\", \"FeaturesA\", \"FeaturesB\"))\r\n.AppendCacheCheckpoint(mlContext);\r\n \r\nvar trainer = mlContext.MulticlassClassification.Trainers.SdcaMaximumEntropy(labelColumnName: \"Label\", featureColumnName: \"Features\")\r\n.Append(mlContext.Transforms.Conversion.MapKeyToValue(\"PredictedLabel\", \"PredictedLabel\"));\r\nvar trainingPipeline = dataProcessPipeline.Append(trainer);'\r\n\r\nI don't get a functioning model, the prediction scores are NaN. I have a couple of questions on this.\r\nI understand that ApplyWordEmbedding returns an estimator, but I had it understood it outputs the average/min/max of all the token vectors, so word vector dimensions *3. \r\n\r\n1) Why isn't this usable as a feature vector into a classifier? If I apply another transform, like NormalizeMinMax, it suddenly works, but that's squashing the values in a way that doesn't make sense.\r\n\r\n2) Why is the model size so small? I expected that, as part of the transform, the whole wordvector model would be included, but it seems like if the data doesn't contain the token, it's not included in the model. That doesn't make word embeddings that useful as part of the point of word vectors is to provide a language model. If I want to classify a sentence containing cat as \"Animal\" but my data doesn't contain dog, the model should still be able to featurize dog as part of the sentence, but it doesn't seem like the model would be able to do that. Apologies if I'm missing something very obvious, going through the WordEmbedding documentation has been a bit difficult for me.\r\n\r\n3) How can I select just the average features? It's not clear from the docs either.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/4954","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Unexpected WordEmbedding behavior as feature vector to a multi-class classifier\" (#4954)"},{"Id":"583494501","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-18T22:14:27","Actor":"frank-dong-ms","Number":"4950","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix race condition for test MulticlassTreeFeaturizedLRTest","State":"closed","Body":"method in TreeEnsembleFeaturizerTransform will be called from multi-threading, make variable \"temp\" as local variable to avoid race condition.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/4950","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"fix race condition for test MulticlassTreeFeaturizedLRTest\" (#4950)"},{"Id":"584001656","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-03-18T21:04:38","Actor":"frank-dong-ms","Number":"4953","RawContent":null,"Title":"test for benchmark test hanging","State":"open","Body":"We are excited to review your PR.\r\n\r\nSo we can do the best job, please check:\r\n\r\n- [ ] There's a descriptive title that will make sense to other developers some time from now. \r\n- [ ] There's associated issues.

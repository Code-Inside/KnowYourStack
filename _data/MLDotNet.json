However, there is now an issue. \n\nI inherit from the DataFrameColumn class to build my own DataFrameColumn implementation. The reasons aren't super important but it's used allow for some implementations of extension methods on the DataFrameColumn class that do computations that require certain data types. The class is a public abstract class, which indicated to me as a user of the ml.net library it was fair game to override and to continue writing extension methods that all were based on the DataFrameColumn abstract base class.\n\nNow, we have an internal abstract method present in the base class, making overriding impossible even though every other abstract method and property is either public or protected: https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/d4bc05db154b1e3c8513e52b9c476f83b49d4048/src/Microsoft.Data.Analysis/DataFrameColumn.cs#L463\n\nIs there anything that can be done to remedy this?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/7323","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Can no longer subclass DataFrameColumn due to internal abstract GetSortIndices method\" (#7323)"},{"Id":"2677293452","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-27T17:45:01","Actor":"asmirnov82","Number":"7324","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix broken inheritance from DataFrameColumn class","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes #7323\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/7324","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix broken inheritance from DataFrameColumn class\" (#7324)"},{"Id":"2699350272","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-27T17:44:27","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"7327","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/4.0] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:a547de0d-c7ea-4682-b0d2-c8a549cede14)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: a547de0d-c7ea-4682-b0d2-c8a549cede14\r\n- **Build**: 20241122.2\r\n- **Date Produced**: November 22, 2024 6:31:15 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: b41381d5cd633471265e9cd72e933a7048e03062\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/9.0\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk**: [from 10.0.0-beta.24504.4 to 9.0.0-beta.24572.2][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Feed**: [from 10.0.0-beta.24504.4 to 9.0.0-beta.24572.2][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Sdk**: [from 10.0.0-beta.24504.4 to 9.0.0-beta.24572.2][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.SignTool**: [from 10.0.0-beta.24504.4 to 9.0.0-beta.24572.2][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.SwaggerGenerator.MSBuild**: [from 10.0.0-beta.24504.4 to 9.0.0-beta.24572.2][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.XliffTasks**: [from 10.0.0-beta.24504.4 to 9.0.0-beta.24572.2][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.XUnitExtensions**: [from 10.0.0-beta.24504.4 to 9.0.0-beta.24572.2][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/compare/f209a925b1...b41381d5cd\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n- **Updates to .NET SDKs:**\r\n  - Updates tools.dotnet to 9.0.100\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:a547de0d-c7ea-4682-b0d2-c8a549cede14)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/7327","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/4.0] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#7327)"},{"Id":"2667559194","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-11-25T21:47:15","Actor":"LittleLittleCloud","Number":"7316","RawContent":null,"Title":"[GenAI] SFT Example","State":"closed","Body":"We are excited to review your PR.\r\n\r\nSo we can do the best job, please check:\r\n\r\n- [ ] There's a descriptive title that will make sense to other developers some time from now. \r\n- [ ] There's associated issues.

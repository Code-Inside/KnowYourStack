Please describe.**\r\nI need a way to visualize how my model is learning during training, which is a comparison between training loss and test loss.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nAn event handler that enables the ability to extract loss during training.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nRunning the model for x epochs, evaluating the model, then retraining the model in a loop.  This unfortunately does not work for all models, such as LightGbm that can't be retrained.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar kfold = ctx.BinaryClassification.CrossValidate(training, estimator, param.kfold);\r\nvar bestModel = kfold.OrderByDescending(p => p.Metrics.Accuracy).Select(p => p.Model).First();\r\n\r\nvar testOutput = bestModel.Transform(test);\r\n\r\nvar metrics = ctx.BinaryClassification.Evaluate(testOutput);\r\n\r\n// This code doesn't work as estimator is IEstimator<ITransform> and bestModel is ITransform.

This duplication of responsibilities is very confusing and absolutely not straightforward. More over, it is slow, as instead of only reading values, ApplyElementwise writes function results into into memory, also it converts read only columns to editable (and that again involves memory copy). So in some circumstances memory can be excessively copied even twice.\r\n2) Legacy method requires to provide function, that takes into account null values - this is not userfriendly.

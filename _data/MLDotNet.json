I have a range of HTTP requests and I want to be able to identify is the request is coming from a bot or not. To train this I have a range of these:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class Request\r\n{\r\n    public string Url { get; set; }\r\n    public string UserAgent { get; set; }\r\n    public bool IsBot { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd a prediction class like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class IsBotPrediction\r\n{\r\n    [ColumnName(\"PredictedLabel\")]\r\n    public bool Prediction { get; set; }\r\n    public float Score { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust for this example, I have created a list of hardcoded data:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar trainingData = new List<Request>\r\n{\r\n    new Request { Url = \"/wp-admin\", UserAgent = \"a bot\", IsBot = true },\r\n    new Request { Url = \"/backoffice\", UserAgent = \"a bot\", IsBot = true },\r\n    new Request { Url = \"/hack\", UserAgent = \"a bot\", IsBot = true },\r\n    new Request { Url = \"/login\", UserAgent = \"a bot\", IsBot = false },\r\n    new Request { Url = \"/dashboard\", UserAgent = \"a bot\", IsBot = false },\r\n    new Request { Url = \"/humans.txt\", UserAgent = \"a bot\", IsBot = false },\r\n    new Request { Url = \"/admin\", UserAgent = \"a bot\", IsBot = true },\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo train a model I'm using the following code:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nIDataView mlData = mlContext.Data.LoadFromEnumerable(trainingData);\r\n\r\nvar dataPrepPipeline = mlContext\r\n    .Transforms\r\n    .Text\r\n    .FeaturizeText(\"UrlF\", \"Url\")\r\n    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Text.FeaturizeText(\"UserAgentF\", \"UserAgent\"))\r\n    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Concatenate(\"Features\", \"UrlF\", \"UserAgentF\"))\r\n    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.NormalizeMinMax(\"Features\", \"Features\"))\r\n    .AppendCacheCheckpoint(mlContext);\r\nvar prepPipeline = dataPrepPipeline.Fit(mlData);\r\n\r\nvar trainer = mlContext\r\n    .BinaryClassification\r\n    .Trainers\r\n    .AveragedPerceptron(labelColumnName: \"IsBot\", numberOfIterations: 10, featureColumnName: \"Features\");\r\n\r\nvar preprocessedData = prepPipeline.Transform(mlData);\r\n\r\nITransformer trainedModel = trainer.Fit(preprocessedData);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe trained model seems to be a success.

The culprit is ShuffleRows which is now extremely slow.\r\n\r\nShuffleRows was already broken in previous release (see issue #5312). The fix for that issue (#5313) is broken too in my opinion. It contains a line with a Thread.Sleep(1) to wait for async completion. This is a no go ... First the Sleep should not be there. And second, sleeping 1ms is dependent on timer resolution which is in general 15ms, so a wait will be in most cases 15ms. As my learning tasks read millions of datarows, this can not work and learning time explode to the point of being unusable. \r\n\r\nTo confirm that Thread.Sleep(1) is the culprit, I changed the timer resolution to 1ms on my server and learning time improved greatly but are still very far from the times I got with version 1.4. The fix for #5312 needs to be redone properly (sorry for being a bit harsh).\r\n\r\nSo ShuffleRows needs a fix, as I suspect this bug will impact many users.

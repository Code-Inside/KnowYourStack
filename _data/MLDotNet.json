When making predictions, all the outputs are the first class even though they should not be. Also the prediction values vary only by a little. Here is an example of two output predictions:\r\n\r\n[1.5047534,  -0.16131932, 0.71119475]\r\n[1.5056, -0.16168906, 0.7110559]\r\n\r\nThis seems odd that there are negative values. So I don't think it is correct from that aspect. I thought it might be because the model was trained on RGBA but the MLContext transform uses ARGB/ABGR/etc. I tried switching the channels of the input images, but this did not help.

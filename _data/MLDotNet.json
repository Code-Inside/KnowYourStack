The core of the\r\nproposal is, instead of working via the entry-point runtime abstraction lying\r\non top of the implementing code, we encourage people to use the implementing\r\ncode directly.\r\n\r\n# Current State\r\n\r\nWithin ML.NET, for a component to be exposed in the \"public\" API, a component\r\nauthor follows the following steps (from an extremely high level):\r\n\r\n1. The author writes a component, implementing some sort of central interface.\r\n   Often this is something like `IDataLoader`, `IDataTransform`, `ITrainer,`\r\n   or some other such type of object.\r\n2. An \"entry-point\" wrapping object is created for that component. This is a\r\n   purely functional view of components as having inputs (as fields in some\r\n   sort of input class) and outputs (as fields in some sort of output class).\r\n   This is decorated with attributes, to allow the dependency injection\r\n   framework to do its work.\r\n3. A JSON \"manifest\" describing all such components is created, through some\r\n   process involving a scan of all `.dll`s and the aforementioned attributes.\r\n4. Some other code reads this JSON \"manifest\" and out of it generates a number\r\n   of C# classes. (This process being the code in `CSharpApiGenerator.cs`, the\r\n   artifact of which is described in `CSharpApi.cs`.)\r\n\r\nA user then works with this component in the following fashion.\r\n\r\n1. The user constructs a `LearningPipeline` object.\r\n2. They adds implementations of `ILearningPipelineItem`, which are sort of\r\n   configuration objects. (These are some of the objects that were code\r\n   generated.)\r\n3. Through some process that is probably too complex to describe here, these\r\n   `ILearningPipelineItem` are transmuted into a sort of abstract \"graph\"\r\n   structure comprised of inputs and outputs. (This is an \"entry-point\"\r\n   experiment graph.)\r\n4. This graph structure is then serialized to JSON, de-serialized back out of\r\n   JSON, then the actual underlying code that implements the operations is\r\n   loaded using dependency injection.\r\n5. Once loaded, the associated \"settings\" objects (which are actual types\r\n   explicitly written in ML.NET) have their fields populated from values in\r\n   this JSON.\r\n6. There is some higher level runtime coordinating this process of graph nodes\r\n   (the entry-point graph runner). This is a sort of runtime for the nodes,\r\n   and handles job scheduling, variable setting, and whatnot.\r\n\r\nThe way this process works is via something called entry-points. Entry-points\r\nwere conceived as a mechanism to enable a \"regular\" way to invoke ML.NET\r\ncomponents from native code, that was more expressive and powerful than the\r\ncommand line. Essentially: they are a command-line on steroids, that instead\r\nof inventing a new DSL utilizes JSON. This is effective at alleviating the\r\nburden of writing \"bridges\" from R and Python into ML.NET. It also has\r\nadvantages in situations where you need to send a sequence of commands \"over\r\nthe wire\" in some complex fashion. While a few types would need to be handled\r\n(e.g., standard numeric types, `IDataView`, `IFileHandle`, and some others),\r\nso long as the entry-points used *only* those supported types, composing an\r\nexperiment in those non-.NET environments would be possible.\r\n\r\n# Possible Alternate State\r\n\r\nInstead of working indirectly with ML.NET components through the entry-point\r\nabstraction, you could just instantiate and use the existing classes directly.\r\nThat is, the aforementioned `IDataLoader`, `IDataTransform`, `ITrainer,` and\r\nso forth would be instantiated and operated on directly.\r\n\r\nWhile entry-points would still be necessary for any components we wished to\r\nexpose through R or Python, we would constrain our usage to those applications\r\nwhere the added level of abstraction served some purpose.\r\n\r\nThis alternate pattern of usage is already well tested, as it actually\r\nreflects how ML.NET itself is written.\r\n\r\n# Changes for ML.NET\r\n\r\nIn order to move towards this state, a few high level adjustments will be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n* Low level API is based direct instantiations of `IDataViews`/`ITrainer` and\r\n  other fundamental types and utilities already used within ML.NET code.\r\n* We will work to actively identify and improve that low level API from the\r\n  point of view of usage. See the sequel for more in depth discussion of this\r\n  point.\r\n* Writing higher level abstractions to make things easier should be\r\n  encouraged, however always with the aim of making them non-opaque. That is,\r\n  in edge cases when the abstraction fails, integrating what *can* be done\r\n  with the abstraction with the lower level explicit API should be possible.\r\n  Generally: Easy things should be easy and hard things should be possible.\r\n* To clarify: We are not getting rid of entry-points, because it remains the\r\n  mechanism by which interop from non-.NET programming environments into TLC\r\n  will continue to happen, and is therefore important. The shift is: the lower\r\n  level C# API will not use entry-points. For the purpose of servicing\r\n  GUI/Python/non-.NET bindings, we will continue in our own code to provide\r\n  entry points, while allowing user code to work by implementing the core\r\n  interfaces directly.\r\n\r\n# Examples of Potential Improvements in \"Direct Access\" API\r\n\r\nWe give the following concrete examples of areas that probably need\r\nimprovement. The examples are meant to be illustrative only. That is: the list\r\nis not exhaustive, nor are specific \"solutions\" to problems meant to convey\r\nthat something *must* be done in a particular way.\r\n\r\n* Instantiation of late binding components was previously always done via\r\n  dependency injection. Therefore, all components have constructors or static\r\n  create methods that have had *identical* signatures (e.g., for transforms,\r\n  `IHostEnvironment env, Arguments args, IDataView input`). Direct\r\n  instantiation by the user *could* use that, but would doubtless be better\r\n  served by a more contextually appropriate constructor that reflects common\r\n  use-cases. For example, this:\r\n\r\n  ```csharp\r\n  IDataTransform trans = new ConcatTransform(env, new ConcatTransform.Arguments()\r\n  {\r\n      Column = new[] {\r\n      new ConcatTransform.Column()\r\n      {\r\n          Name = \"NumericalFeatures\",\r\n          Source = new[] { \"SqftLiving\", \"SqftLot\", \"SqftAbove\",   \"SqftBasement\",\r\n              \"Lat\", \"Long\", \"SqftLiving15\", \"SqftLot15\" }\r\n      }}\r\n  }, loader);\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  may become this:\r\n\r\n  ```csharp\r\n  IDataTransform trans = new ConcatTransform(env, loader, \"NumericalFeatures\",\r\n      \"SqftLiving\", \"SqftLot\", \"SqftAbove\", \"SqftBasement\", \"Lat\", \"Long\",\r\n      \"SqftLiving15\", \"SqftLot15\");\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  This can work both ways: if these objects are directly instantiated, the\r\n  objects could provide richer information than merely being an\r\n  `IDataTransform`, or what have you. Due to working via the command line,\r\n  entry-points, or a GUI, it is considered almost useless for a component to\r\n  have any purely programmatic access. So for example: we could have had the\r\n  `AffineNormalizer` expose its slope and intercept, but we instead expose it\r\n  by metadata instead. A direct accessor in ML.NET may be appropriate if we\r\n  directly use these components.\r\n\r\n* Creating a transform and loader feels similar. However, creating a trainer,\r\n  using it to provide a predictor, and then ultimately parameterizing a scorer\r\n  transform with that predictor. Where possible we can try to harmonize the\r\n  interfaces to make them seem more consistent. (Obviously not always possible\r\n  since the underlying abstraction may in fact be genuinely different.)\r\n\r\n* Some parts of the current library introduce needless complexity: `Train`\r\n  method on trainer is `void`, always followed by `CreatePredictor`. Other\r\n  incidents of needless complexity may be less easy to resolve.\r\n\r\n* Some parts of the current library introduce *needful* complexity, but could\r\n  probably be improved somehow. `RoleMappedData` creation and usage, while\r\n  providing an essential service (\"use this column for this purpose\"), is\r\n  incredibly difficult to use. When it was just an \"internal\" structure we\r\n  just sort of dealt with it, but we would like to improve it. (In some cases\r\n  we can hide its creation into auxillary helper methods, for example.)\r\n\r\n* Simple things like improving naming of things may just help a lot. For\r\n  example: `ScoreUtils.GetScorer` returns a transform with the predictor's\r\n  scores applied to data. `ScoreUtils.GetScoredData` or something may be a\r\n  better name.\r\n\r\n* Our so-called \"internal\" methods do not always direct people towards pits of\r\n  success. For example: some pipeline components should probably apply only\r\n  during training (e.g., filtering, sampling, caching). Some distinction or\r\n  other engineering nicety (e.g., have the utilities for saving models throw\r\n  by default) may help warn people off this common misuse case.\r\n\r\n* Components of the existing API that deal with\r\n  late-binding/dependency-injection stuff could potentially use delegates or\r\n  something like entry-point style factory interfaces instead. This means\r\n  among other things lifting out things like `SubComponent` from most code.\r\n  Whether these delegates happen to be composed from the command line parser\r\n  calling `SubComponent.CreateInstance`, or some entry-point \"subgraph\"\r\n  generating a delegate out of its own graph, is the business of the command\r\n  line parser and entry-point engine, not the component code itself. (Maybe\r\n  the delegate just calls Run graph or something then binds the values.)\r\n\r\n  So for example what is currently this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nnew Ova(env, new Ova.Argumnets() { Trainer = new SubComponent(\"sdcaR\") );\r\n```\r\n\r\nmight become this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nnew Ova(env, host => new SdcaRegression(host));\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that many of these enhancements will serve not only users, but component\r\nauthors (including us), and so improve the whole platform.\r\n\r\n# Miscellaneous Details\r\n\r\nNote that C# code generation from entry-point graphs will still be possible:\r\nall entry-point invocations come down to (1) defining input objects, (2)\r\ncalling a static method and (3) doing something with the output object.\r\nHowever it will probably not be possible to make it seem \"natural\" any more\r\nthan an attempt to do code-generation from a `mml` command line would seem\r\n\"natural.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we decided to make the public facing API entry-points based, this\r\nnecessarily required shifting related infrastructure (e.g., `GraphRunner`,\r\n`JsonManifestUtils`) into more central assemblies. Once that \"idiom\" is\r\ndeconstructed, this infrastructure should resume its prior state of being in\r\nan isolated assembly.\r\n\r\nAlong similar lines of isolation, once we shift the components to not use\r\n`SubComponent` directly, we can \"uplift\" what is currently the command line\r\nparsing code out into a separate assembly.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/371","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Proposal for Major Change in API\" (#371)"},{"Id":"333367907","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2018-06-18T18:33:06","Actor":"eerhardt","Number":"370","RawContent":null,"Title":"Move the NuGet package build files into a TFM specific directory.","State":"closed","Body":"When installing Microsoft.ML on an unsupported framework (like net452), it is currently getting installed successfully.

I have set the MLContext's seed, as well as the seed on TrainTestSplit, but still the results are non-deterministic.\r\n\r\nMy dataset consists of ~1.3 million rows.  Some pseudo code of what my pipeline has:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar context = new MLContext(seed: 0); // Set seed\r\nvar data = context.Data.LoadFromTextFile<DataInput>(_dataPath);\r\n\r\nvar split = _context.Data.TrainTestSplit(data, testFraction: 0.1, seed: 0);\r\n\r\nvar pipeline = context.Transforms.CustomMapping<DataInput, Data>(new DataFactory().GetMapping(), contractName: \"Data\")\r\n    .Append(context.Transforms.CopyColumns(\"Label\", nameof(Data.NoShow)))\r\n    .Append(context.Transforms.Concatenate(\"Features\", allFeatureNames));\r\n    \r\nvar trainer = _context.BinaryClassification.Trainers.SdcaLogisticRegression();\r\nvar model = pipeline.Append(trainer).Fit(split.TrainSet);\r\n\r\nvar predictions = model.Transform(split.TestSet);\r\nvar metrics = context.BinaryClassification.Evaluate(predictions);\r\nConsole.WriteLine(metrics.F1Score);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs the SdcaLogisticRegressionBinaryTrainer just inheritently non-deterministic?  Is there an explanation as to why my F1Scores would jump so dramatically each time?","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/5754","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Non-deterministic SdcaLogisticRegression results when using fixed seeds\" (#5754)"},{"Id":"862153117","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-04-20T00:08:29","Actor":"stephentoub","Number":"5753","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix erroneous use of TaskContinuationOptions in ThreadUtils.cs","State":"open","Body":"This was supposed to be TaskCreationOptions.

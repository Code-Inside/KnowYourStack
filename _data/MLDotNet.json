Check it out if I'm wrong.\r\nI think that the task of determining the brand or model will be more difficult and decided to start with the ranking.\r\n\r\nThe question is how to implement image ranking in ml.net. Should I use ImageClassification with 10 labels (1, 2, 3, ...), which are the evaluation of the beauty/cleanliness of the car? \r\nOr is there another more concise way to get the output of a single normalized number from 0 to 1 that represents the beauty/cleanliness score of the machine","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/5727","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Question] How realize ranking (scoring) images? \" (#5727)"},{"Id":"830460540","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-22T17:09:13","Actor":"pgovind","Number":"5712","RawContent":null,"Title":"IDataView to DataFrame","State":"closed","Body":"An extension method to convert an IDataView to a DataFrame.\r\n\r\ncc @LittleLittleCloud \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5712","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"IDataView to DataFrame\" (#5712)"},{"Id":"837849914","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-22T15:38:19","Actor":"luisquintanilla","Number":"5726","RawContent":null,"Title":"Why not newer than CUDA 10.0?","State":"open","Body":"Transferring product question posted in .NET Docs repo from @zleepy\r\n\r\nOriginal Issue (dotnet/docs#23312)\r\n\r\nWhy should i not install CUDA newer than v10.0? 10.0 does not support newer versions of VS 2019.\r\nA newer version of CUDA 10 says it does support VS 2019, see: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/archive/10.2/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html.\r\n\r\nAnd even newer, CUDA 11.2.1 does also say it supports VS, see: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/archive/11.2.1/cuda-installation-guide-microsoft-windows/index.html\r\n\r\nWhat is the reason this page explicit says that i should not install anything that Nvidia says is supported by newer versions of VS?\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/5726","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Why not newer than CUDA 10.0?\" (#5726)"},{"Id":"837515425","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-22T09:29:09","Actor":"manuelfuchs","Number":"5725","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support for Hierarchical Clustering","State":"open","Body":"### Issue\r\n\r\nThis issue is based on #4961.\r\nIt would be nice to see support for Hierarchical Clustering besides the KMeans implementation in ML.NET.\r\nAn open source implementation of the AGNES algorithm [Kaufman & Rousseeuw, 1990] already exists in this open-source library [Aglomera](https://github.com/pedrodbs/Aglomera) that's licensed under the MIT license.\r\n\r\n> Currently, Aglomera.NET implements program AGNES (AGglomerative NESting) of [Kaufman & Rousseeuw, 1990], i.e., the bottom-up approach, the It supports different linkage criteria and also provides several metrics to perform internal and external evaluation of clustering results. The results of clustering can be exported to a Json file to be visualized as a dendrogram in Dendrogram Viewer, an interactive web-application using D3.js.\r\n\r\nBased on the description of Hierarchical Clustering by Aglomera ...\r\n\r\n> The clustering result is a list containing the cluster-set and the corresponding dissimilarity / distance at which it was created at each step of the algorithm. The result is organized in a hierarchical form, i.e., where each cluster references either the two parents that were merged for its creation (in the agglomerative approach), or the two children resulting from splitting the cluster (in the divisive approach). Due to their hierarchical nature, clustering results can be visualized via a dendrogram.\r\n\r\n... the expected result of this additional Model would not be a fixed amount of clusters (as with KMeans), but rather a tree containing the d.\r\nThe actual clusters can then be obtained by cutting the three at a certain height.\r\nBesides visualizing the hierarchical dependencies between clusters, this would give the developer more control regarding the amount of clusters, since this can be decided after the tree was calculated.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n1.

First I map the existing projects' tree to the standard tree manually and save the results in the database, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n| Label      | Level1         | Level2         | Level3         |\r\n| --------   | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |\r\n| A          | A              |      *         |       *        |\r\n| A-AA       | A              |      AA1       |       *        |\r\n| A-AA-AAA   | A              |      AA1       |      AAA1      |\r\n| A-BB       | A              |      BB2       |       *        |\r\n| A-BB-BBB   | A              |      BB2       |      BBB2      |\r\n| A          | A              |      *         |       *        |\r\n| A-AA-AAA   | A              |      AAA1      |       *        |\r\n| A-BB       | A              |      BB2       |       *        |\r\n| A-BB-BBB   | A              |      BB2       |      BBB2      |  \r\n```\r\n  \r\nBecause data in the column in ML.Net cannot be a missing value, so I replace them with *.

Hopefully I can use the prediction to map the tree instead of doing this manually. \r\n   \r\nI successfully implemented the prediction. However, the prediction result is really poor.\r\n\r\nSo my question is:\r\n\r\n1. Is the way I do this right?\r\n2.

It seems the advice used to be to create a completely [Custom IDataView](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/3460#issuecomment-485490908) according to this answer on GitHub.\r\n\r\nBut this was before there was a new attribute denoting Image types making the first example obsolete as far as I can tell. There is a unit test showing this newer approach [here](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/8dd47c13bf815d748a4fa78e9313a83827bb2057/test/Microsoft.ML.Tests/ImagesTests.cs#L220).\r\n\r\nThe issue is these all seem to re-save the MLModel.zip file as part of their setup setting a new input schema whereas I just want to adapt the inputs at runtime.

Even attempting the re-saving option isn't working as I can't get the methodology of not having to process the images and loading the existing model. It always complains about the schema is wrong.\r\n\r\nSo far I've been trying with this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static PredictionEngine<MlClientModelInput, MlClientModelOutput> Create()\r\n{\r\n    // Create new MLContext\r\n    MLContext mlContext = new MLContext();\r\n\r\n    var dataProcessPipeline = mlContext.Transforms.ResizeImages(\"Image\", 328, 256);\r\n\r\n    //var model = mlContext.Model.Load(MLNetModelPath, out var modelInputSchema);\r\n    //var pipeline = mlContext.Transforms.ConvertToGrayscale(\"GrayImage\", \"Image\");\r\n\r\n    ITransformer model = dataProcessPipeline.Fit(CreateEmptyDataView(mlContext));\r\n    // Load model & create prediction engine\r\n    ITransformer mlModel = mlContext.Model.Load(MLNetModelPath, out var modelInputSchema);\r\n\r\n    mlContext.Model.Save(mlModel, null, MLNetModelPathEdited);\r\n\r\n    // Create new MLContext\r\n    MLContext mlContext2 = new MLContext();\r\n    ITransformer mlModel2 = mlContext.Model.Load(MLNetModelPathEdited, out var modelInputSchema2);\r\n    var predEngine = mlContext.Model.CreatePredictionEngine<MlClientModelInput, MlClientModelOutput>(mlModel);\r\n\r\n    return predEngine;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI've now found [an example](https://github.com/ma-gu/machinelearning-samples/blob/bitmap-dataview/samples/csharp/getting-started/DeepLearning_ObjectDetection_Onnx_Visualization/ObjectDetection.Core/OnnxModelScorer.cs) that is almost exactly what I need but it's also loading a model differently so I'm still unsure how to implement a pipeline without having to standardize the data. It's all very confusing.\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\r\nusing System.Drawing;\r\nusing System.Linq;\r\nusing Microsoft.ML;\r\nusing

Or you can run it in Jupyter notebook via dotnet interactive kernel.\r\n```fsharp\r\n#r \"nuget: Microsoft.ML\"\r\n#r \"nuget: Microsoft.ML.Mkl.Components\"\r\nopen System\r\nopen Microsoft.ML\r\nopen Microsoft.ML.Data\r\n\r\n[<CLIMutable>]\r\ntype Factor = {\r\n    [<ColumnName(\"Label\")>]\r\n    y : float32\r\n    intercept: float32\r\n    x : float32\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Generate data: y = x * 2 + rnd\r\nlet rnd = Random()\r\nlet rows =\r\n    [1.0 .. 100.0]\r\n    |> Seq.map(fun v ->\r\n        {\r\n            y = float32 (v * 2.0 + rnd.NextDouble())\r\n            intercept = float32 1.\r\n            x = float32 v\r\n        }\r\n    )\r\n\r\nlet context = new MLContext()\r\nlet dataView = context.Data.LoadFromEnumerable(rows)\r\nlet pipeline =\r\n    EstimatorChain()\r\n        .Append(context.Transforms.Concatenate(\"Features\", \"intercept\", \"x\"))\r\n        .Append(context.Regression.Trainers.Ols())\r\n\r\nlet model = dataView |> pipeline.Fit\r\nlet modelParams = model.LastTransformer.Model\r\nSeq.zip3 modelParams.Weights modelParams.TValues modelParams.PValues\r\n|> Array.ofSeq\r\n|> Array.iteri(fun i (w, t, p) ->\r\n    printfn $\"Beta {i}, w: {w:f3}, tStats: {t:f3}, pValue: {p:f3}\")\r\n```\r\nOutput\r\n```\r\nBeta 0, w: 0.005, tStats: 0.000, pValue: 1.000\r\nBeta 1, w: 2.000, tStats: 0.000, pValue: 1.000\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother general feedback is that the ceremony in ML.NET is so complicated, compared to the simplicity in R sample above. I do not expect users from R/Python community can embrace this complexity. The library seems to be designed for software engineers only in mind. Maybe there's a balance in between R/Python and dotnet.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/5696","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"OLS regression outputs wrong TStats and PValue\" (#5696)"},{"Id":"822360014","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-03-04T21:46:13","Actor":"MichaelBetser","Number":"5643","RawContent":null,"Title":"ml.net 1.5.2 not compiling on windows because missing dependencies","State":"closed","Body":"### System information\r\n\r\n- **OS version/distro**: windows 10 x64 pro version 10.0.19042\r\n- **.NET Version (eg., dotnet --info)**: 5.0.200\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\n- **What did you do?**\r\nTried to compile ml.net 1.5.2 on windows to get compatible maml.exe binary\r\n- **What happened?**\r\ncompile is failing when resolving dependencies\r\n- **What did you expect?**\r\nto compile\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\nE:\\git\\ml.net_1.5.2\\machinelearning>.\\build.cmd\r\nInstalling procdump.exe\r\nFinish install procdump.exe\r\nInstalling dotnet runtime 2.1.12...\r\nInstalling dotnet cli 3.1.102...\r\nRestoring BuildTools version 3.0.0-preview4-04926-01...\r\nERROR: Could not restore build tools correctly.\r\nPlease check the detailed log that follows.\r\nRunning \"E:\\git\\ml.net_1.5.2\\machinelearning\\init-tools.cmd\"\r\nInstalling 'https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Runtime/2.1.12/dotnet-runtime-2.1.12-win-x64.zip' to 'E:\\git\\ml.net_1.5.2\\machinelearning\\Tools\\dotnetcli\\dotnet-runtime-2.1.12-win-x64.zip'\r\nInstalling 'https://dotnetcli.azureedge.net/dotnet/Sdk/3.1.102/dotnet-sdk-3.1.102-win-x64.zip' to 'E:\\git\\ml.net_1.5.2\\machinelearning\\Tools\\dotnetcli\\dotnet-sdk-3.1.102-win-x64.zip'\r\nRunning: \"E:\\git\\ml.net_1.5.2\\machinelearning\\Tools\\dotnetcli\\dotnet.exe\" restore \"E:\\git\\ml.net_1.5.2\\machinelearning\\init-tools.msbuild\" --no-cache --packages \"E:\\git\\ml.net_1.5.2\\machinelearning\\packages\" --source \"https://dotnet.myget.org/F/dotnet-buildtools/api/v3/index.json\" /p:BuildToolsPackageVersion=3.0.0-preview4-04926-01 /p:ToolsDir=E:\\git\\ml.net_1.5.2\\machinelearning\\Tools\r\nE:\\git\\ml.net_1.5.2\\machinelearning\\init-tools.msbuild : error NU1101: Unable to find package Microsoft.SymbolUploader.Build.Task.

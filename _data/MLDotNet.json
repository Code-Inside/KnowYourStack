Please describe.**\nYes, it is.\nSome of our clients may have outdated encodings on their client application.\nWe still want our clients to have access to new encodings even if their client application is not up to date, hence we want to serve the encoder dictionary from a server endpoint.\n\n**A clear and concise description of what the problem is.**\nThe problem is that, currently, the Encoder property in TiktokenTokenizer is internal.\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/509032755b912e7bb0dd50c10a3172ead57965f3/src/Microsoft.ML.Tokenizers/Model/TiktokenTokenizer.cs#L998-L1001\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nI would like to expose this Encoder property.\nThere seems to be the intent to expose this property at some point in the

do you think?\n\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nMaybe a separate method that does exactly what that test from above does using reflection.\nSounds like overkill and a lot of overhead though.\nExposing the property is probably the best way to deal with this.\n\n**Additional context**\nI'm sending a PR your way with the changes, feel free to ask for/make any modifications you think

In my case, they are about 150 characters long. Name includes a-Z 0-9 and the dash character. ColumnInference reports them correctly. However, after starting training with AutoML, the columns are not used for training. If there are only long titles error about missing \"Features\" column is thrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Create dataset with long column names (numeric in my case)\r\n2.  Column inference reports them correctly:\r\n`ColumnInferenceResults columnInference = mlContext.Auto().InferColumns(TrainDataPath, LabelColumnName, groupColumns: false);`\r\n3. Train:\r\n                 `   experimentResult = experiment.Execute(TrainDataView, ValidationDataView, columnInformation, null, progressHandler);`\r\n4. Observe exception about missing Features.\r\n5. Rename columns to shorter manually, or in a loop to confirm training now works. This can be also used as a workaround for now.\r\n```\r\nvar copyPipeline= mlContext.Transforms.CopyColumns(\"col\" + i, col.Name);\r\nOriginalTrainDataView = pipeline.Fit(OriginalTrainDataView).Transform(OriginalTrainDataView);\r\n\r\n```\r\nNote: I have tree-based algorithms enabled.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nLong column names should be trained normally. \r\nIf not possible, an exception should be received. Now user might think all data is being used to train but actually some columns may be ignored.\r\n\r\nIt is possible Verbose level would give information about this, but it is disabled by default in AutoML. I did not run separately with verbose output.\r\n\r\n**Additional data**\r\nThere may be many reasons why dataset could include long column names. For example, they may have name, id and settings of a measurement device included in the column name.\r\n\r\nIf possible, I'd like to know what is currently the column length limit even if this would be fixed. That helps know which fields have been ignored in earlier models.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/6045","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Long Column names are unexpectedly dropped in training\" (#6045)"},{"Id":"1100612691","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-12T17:34:32","Actor":"michaelgsharp","Number":"6043","RawContent":null,"Title":"TestBackAndForthConversionWithAlphaNoInterleave disabled","State":"open","Body":"This issue is to track that the test TestBackAndForthConversionWithAlphaNoInterleave has been disabled for stability in the ARM legs of the CI builds.

Go to Solution Explorer, select your project\r\n2. Right click, Add, Machine Learning Project\r\n3. Set your data source, and labels, run the training to have the generated code\r\n4. Consume the data by using the generated code, fill the `ModelInput` with values and call `MLModel.Predit(ModelInput)` method\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI was expecting to have a `ModelOutput` object returned, but I got the above exception instead. \r\nIt would be also great to have a more detailed exception to help the bug hunting if it is caused by misconfiguration on the user's part.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots, Code, Sample Projects**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/910321/148753662-df21fd3f-14f8-434c-8a88-f34caa3882c3.png)\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nProbably not a critical information, but my data source is a ~360 MB big CSV file with 5120 float feature columns, 6 label columns (of which 5 are ignored for the training) and it has 5500 rows.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/6035","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"IndexOutOfRangeException at Microsoft.ML.Data.BufferBuilder`1.AddFeature\" (#6035)"},{"Id":"1096173858","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-07T10:09:54","Actor":"isaac12391","Number":"6034","RawContent":null,"Title":"Crashing in UWP Release, but not in Debug","State":"open","Body":" - windows 10.0.19042 Build 19042\r\n - ML.NET Version: v1.7.0\r\n - .NET Version: 2.0\r\n - UWP Version - 2004 - 1803\r\n\r\nML.Net works in debug UWP, but when released in UWP, crashes due to Exception thrown: 'System.ArgumentNullException' in System.Linq.dll.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help, \r\n\r\nIsaac\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/6034","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Crashing in UWP Release, but not in Debug\" (#6034)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2022-01-30T03:30:22.5757183Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":627}

It changed my user experience with AutoML experiments significantly, because I regularly had crashes and failed trials when I tried to run experiments for a long time. With this modification I could implement my own IMonitor and react to changes in memory demand, virtual memory usage, remaining disk space and I could skip a trial if it was running unexpectedly long without terminating the experiment.\r\n\r\nBefore the modifications in this PR my experiments usually stopped with an error in a few hours, but since I have much more control over the experiment with these modifications I could run much longer experiment without any issues.\r\n\r\nOn the technical level I moved the performance-related properties of the `TrialSettings` class into a separate `TrialPerformanceMetrics` subclass, I added a timer to check for those CPU and memory metrics, and I added a new `ReportTrialResourceUsage` event to the `IMonitor` class that is called periodically during the trial-run. I also added the `CancellationTokenSource` class of the trial to the `TrialSettings` so that the user can skip a trial if they wish.\r\n\r\nYou can also check [my custom IMonitor implementation](https://github.com/andrasfuchs/BioBalanceDetector/blob/master/Software/Source/BBDProto08/BBD.BodyMonitor/BBD.BodyMonitor.API/Models/MLContextLoggerMonitor.cs) where the resource monitoring and cancellation logic is demonstrated.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/6520","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add continuous resource monitoring to AutoML.IMonitor\" (#6520)"},{"Id":"1476577455","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-05T13:32:36","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"6518","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"open","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:1c26c342-7dbd-4e18-3778-08daa2f83374)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: 1c26c342-7dbd-4e18-3778-08daa2f83374\r\n- **Build**: 20221201.3\r\n- **Date Produced**: December 1, 2022 4:35:55 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 06f4fb81b32083ab58523f1ea0555a3bcbda6066\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/release/7.0\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk**: [from 7.0.0-beta.22572.6 to 7.0.0-beta.22601.3][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Feed**: [from 7.0.0-beta.22572.6 to 7.0.0-beta.22601.3][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Sdk**: [from 7.0.0-beta.22572.6 to 7.0.0-beta.22601.3][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.SignTool**: [from 7.0.0-beta.22572.6 to 7.0.0-beta.22601.3][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.SwaggerGenerator.MSBuild**: [from 7.0.0-beta.22572.6 to 7.0.0-beta.22601.3][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.XUnitExtensions**: [from 7.0.0-beta.22572.6 to 7.0.0-beta.22601.3][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/compare/82d0268...06f4fb8\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:1c26c342-7dbd-4e18-3778-08daa2f83374)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/6518","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#6518)"},{"Id":"1473639236","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-04T21:33:22","Actor":"Ghaandy","Number":"6517","RawContent":null,"Title":"Multiclassification - LightGBM and FastTree not working as expected with infere column","State":"closed","Body":"*CLOSING*","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/6517","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Multiclassification - LightGBM and FastTree not working as expected with infere column\" (#6517)"},{"Id":"1473550094","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-02T22:53:18","Actor":"zewditu","Number":"6516","RawContent":null,"Title":"Text classification  Predict result  is not calibrated.","State":"open","Body":"**System Information (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS & Version: [e.g. Windows 10] \r\n - ML.NET Version: [e.g. ML.NET v1.5.5]\r\n - .NET Version: [e.g. .NET 5.0]\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

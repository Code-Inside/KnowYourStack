The issue is coming from the assumption that `ImageResizer` creates a separate `Bitmap`, but when image is already the target dimension `ImageResizer` actually simply returns the source image. Other image methods are likely to dispose of the source image. For example, in this test a getter method get's called twice, and on the second call the source image gets disposed, causing the error. \r\n\r\nA transformer should only be responsible of disposing the objects it creates. One attempt to solve this issue was to keep track of the last Bitmap created to ensure we don't dispose of an object that was not created within  `ImageResizer.` However, the issue encountered with this approach is that the object created by another transformer may be deleted if that transform gets called again. This happens because the source buffers get reused, so image transforms will dispose the previous source image object when they get called again.  \r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/master/src/Microsoft.ML.ImageAnalytics/ImageLoader.cs#L238","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5474","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix for #5469\" (#5474)"},{"Id":"735932441","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-04T17:38:26","Actor":"fuomag9","Number":"5473","RawContent":null,"Title":"Is it possible to convert a ml.net model (.zip) to ONNX or tensorflow model?","State":"closed","Body":"### System information\r\n\r\n- **Win 10 10.0.19041**:\r\n- **.NET Version 3.1.402**: \r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\nIs it possible to convert a ml.net model (.zip) to ONNX or tensorflow model?

(It mainly finds backpacks, handbags, some apples and some other unexpected results). The image I'm using:\r\n![dog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2350015/97497833-66185d80-196b-11eb-8c96-ce7ed676cbd6.jpg)\r\n\r\nI created a repository to reproduce my issue as well:\r\nhttps://github.com/devedse/DeveMLNetTest\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I'm quite new to all of this :smile:\r\n\r\n### Steps I've taken\r\n\r\nI first wanted to obtain a pre-trained model which I was sure worked so I did the following steps:\r\n1. Cloned: https://github.com/Tianxiaomo/pytorch-YOLOv4\r\n1. Installed requirements + pytorch + cuda etc.\r\n1. Downloaded the Yolov4_epoch1.pth model and put it in `checkpoints\\Yolov4_epoch1.pth`\r\n1. Ran `demo_pytorch2onnx.py` with debug enabled.\r\n\r\nWhen you do this you can step through the code where the output from the model is parsed (this shows the labels for all boxes with a confidence higher then 0.6):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2350015/97498111-e212a580-196b-11eb-83b3-013f905eec5e.png)\r\n\r\nWhen we look up these labels, we can see that (all +1 since it's a 0-index array):\r\n```\r\n1: bicycle\r\n8: truck\r\n16: dog\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the results in Python seem to be correct. This python script first converts the model to an ONNX model and then uses that model to do the inference.\r\n\r\nWhen I now start using the model inside C# though and try to parse through the results in exactly the same way I find completely different results:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2350015/97498763-0622b680-196d-11eb-91b9-bb02374e7e39.png)\r\n\r\nCould it be that the model is somehow creating garbage data?\r\n\r\nAnyway, here's the code that I'm \r\n\r\nMLContext:\r\n```\r\nvar pipeline = mlContext.Transforms.LoadImages(outputColumnName: \"image\", imageFolder: \"\", inputColumnName: nameof(ImageNetData.ImagePath))\r\n                .Append(mlContext.Transforms.ResizeImages(outputColumnName: \"image\", imageWidth: ImageNetSettings.imageWidth, imageHeight: ImageNetSettings.imageHeight, inputColumnName: \"image\"))\r\n                .Append(mlContext.Transforms.ExtractPixels(outputColumnName: \"input\", inputColumnName: \"image\"))\r\n                .Append(mlContext.Transforms.ApplyOnnxModel(\r\n                    modelFile: modelLocation,\r\n                    outputColumnNames: new[] { \"boxes\", \"confs\" },\r\n                    inputColumnNames: new[] { \"input\" }\r\n                    ));\r\n```\r\n\r\nCode to parse model output:\r\n```\r\npublic IList<YoloBoundingBox> ParseOutputs(float[] boxes, float[] confs, float threshold = .6F)\r\n{\r\n\tvar boxesUnflattened = new List<BoundingBoxDimensions>();\r\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < boxes.Length; i += 4)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tboxesUnflattened.Add(new BoundingBoxDimensions()\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tX = boxes[i],\r\n\t\t\tY = boxes[i + 1],\r\n\t\t\tWidth = boxes[i + 2] - boxes[i],\r\n\t\t\tHeight = boxes[i + 3] - boxes[i + 1],\r\n\t\t\tOriginalStuff = boxes.Skip(i).Take(4).ToArray()\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tvar confsUnflattened = new List<float[]>();\r\n\tfor (int i = 0; i < confs.Length; i += 80)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tconfsUnflattened.Add(confs.Skip(i).Take(80).ToArray());\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tvar maxConfidencePerBox = confsUnflattened.Select(t => t.Select((n, i) => (Number: n, Index: i)).Max()).ToList();\r\n\tvar boxesNumbered = boxesUnflattened.Select((b, i) => (Box: b, Index: i)).ToList();\r\n\r\n\tvar boxesIndexWhichHaveHighConfidence = maxConfidencePerBox.Where(t => t.Number > threshold).ToList();\r\n\tvar allBoxesThemselvesWithHighConfidence = boxesIndexWhichHaveHighConfidence.Join(boxesNumbered, t => t.Index, t => t.Index, (l, r) => (Box: r, Conf: l)).ToList();\r\n\r\n\r\n\tConsole.WriteLine(\"I would expect a bike, dog and car here\");\r\n\tConsole.WriteLine(\"Instead we got:\");\r\n\r\n\tforeach (var b in allBoxesThemselvesWithHighConfidence)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tvar startString = $\"{b.Conf.Number}: {labels[b.Conf.Index]}\";\r\n\t\tConsole.WriteLine($\"{startString.PadRight(30, ' ')}({string.Join(\",\", b.Box.Box.OriginalStuff)})\");\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tthrow new InvalidOperationException(\"Everything below this doesn't work anyway\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan someone give me some hints / ideas on why I could be running into this issue?\r\n\r\nAlso feel free to clone the repo and press F5.

Depending on the dataset (and on how many incorrectly formatted rows it has) it could actually load into memory the whole dataset (or as much as the `StringBuilder `supports, which is [typically 2^32 chars ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.stringbuilder.maxcapacity?view=netcore-3.1#System_Text_StringBuilder_MaxCapacity))\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nid,description,animal\r\n0,\"this quoted field isnt closed,cat\r\n1,this field doesnt include quotes,dog\r\n... // no quoted fields in here\r\n2555,\"it is until this quoted field that the multilinereader actually stops reading row 0\",bird\r\n2556,\"this row will be read correctly\",dog\r\n```\r\n\r\n@justinormont 's suggestion here: https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5125#discussion_r427002585\r\n\r\nis to add another option to the `TextLoader `that let the user set the maximum length of a row, and if that threshold is passed, then simply ignore the line and continue reading the input file without loading everything into it.\r\n\r\nI think that before introducing more options to the `TextLoader`, it's better to see if users actually hit this problem when using `readMultilines`.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/5144","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add line limit to readMultilines in TextLoader\" (#5144)"},{"Id":"618107979","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-19T20:48:19","Actor":"antoniovs1029","Number":"5125","RawContent":null,"Title":"Enable TextLoader to accept new lines in quoted fields","State":"closed","Body":"Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-automl/issues/193\r\n\r\nAddresses these issues (see below):\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/4460\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/702\r\n\r\nBased on @LittleLittleCloud 's PR: \r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/4584\r\n\r\nThis PR enables TextLoader to load rows which have new line characters inside quoted fields. So, for example, if the input CSV file has:\r\n\r\n```\r\nid,description,animal\r\n11,\"this is a\r\nquoted field with\r\nnewlines\",cat\r\n```\r\nthen all of that will actually be loaded into a single row. Previously, if the TextLoader was presented with such a case, it would typically throw exceptions because it wasn't able to parse it correctly.\r\n\r\nI took @LittleLittleCloud 's PR which had most of the work done, and added some corner cases, public interfaces to this feature, and made and ran different tests, addressing the comments on that other PR.\r\n\r\n### Complying with RFC 4180\r\nI was tasked to take care of this issue, while also making the TextLoader compliant with [RFC 4180](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) (on CSV format). Turns out the TextLoader already accepted pretty much everything that the RFC states, except for accepting new lines inside quoted fields, which is pretty much the only thing fixed in this PR.\r\n\r\n1. Notice that this means that TextLoader was already able to escape 2 double quotes (\"\") inside quoted fields; i.e. `\"this is \"\"an\"\" example\"` will correctly be loaded as `this is \"an\" example`.\r\n2. When loading CSV files TextLoader also accepts and do other things that the RFC doesn't mention. For example, filtering lines that start with \"//\" as if they were comments, or accepting 1 double quote (\") in the middle of a field when allowQuoting is false.\r\n3. It seems to me the only thing that the RFC states and that ML.NET doesn't follow, is that the RFC says that spaces should also be considered part of the fields, and not be ignored... but in general ML.NET ignores spaces at [the beginning](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/8e5f7b42cd65660393b3ac59765ae166ee7ea4ad/src/Microsoft.ML.Data/DataLoadSave/Text/TextLoaderParser.cs#L1095) and [at the end](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/8e5f7b42cd65660393b3ac59765ae166ee7ea4ad/src/Microsoft.ML.Data/DataLoadSave/Text/TextLoaderParser.cs#L802) of each field, and line.\r\n\r\n### Modelbuilder and AutoML issues\r\nThere are different issues in Modelbuilder and AutoML that were supposed to be caused by TextLoader and I was supposed to fix them on this PR. But after looking into them, it doesn't seem that they are caused by the TextLoader. I have opened [this issue](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/747) in ModelBuilder explaining this in more detail, but in general, for some reason, if the first line (after the header) of a CSV file contains a comma inside a quoted field, then ModelBuilder shows an error saying it can't be loaded; it was said that the problem was on TextLoader, but it isn't, particularly because TextLoader doesn't have any problem escaping commas inside quoted fields.\r\n\r\nSo, regarding issue https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/702\r\n1. ML.NET's TextLoader was able to load most of the datasets pointed there, despite the fact that ModelBuilder shows an error message when the user selects them on the GUI.\r\n2. Only some of the jigsaw datasets (such as jigsaw-toxic-comment-train.csv) and the Airbnb datasets included new lines inside quoted fields so they couldn't be loaded by ML.NET. This is fixed on this PR.\r\n\r\nRegarding issue https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/4460\r\n1. @LittleLittleCloud mentioned that there were problems using InferColumns() with CSV files that contained new lines inside quotes, so this is fixed on this PR and I add a test reproducing that.\r\n2. @LittleLittleCloud also provided a listings.csv dataset, which doesn't include new lines inside quotes, and so this PR doesn't really affect that. Regarding this dataset, he didn't mentioned problems loading it, but that there were some problems with how the InferColumns method worked with double quotes. It looks to me that that dataset is loaded correctly (i.e. scaping \"\" as expected), so I further discussions would be needed about this to see where's the real root cause, as it's likely not in TextLoader.\r\n\r\n### Testing this PR\r\nTo test this PR I:\r\n1. Added 2 new tests\r\n2. Ran locally all existing ML.NET tests, using ReadMultilines = true as default. And it all worked as expected. I did this both using 1 thread or multiple threads for the text loader, to check the effect of multithreading.\r\n3. Loaded all the datasets provided by ModelBuilder team successfully in ML.NET.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5125","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Enable TextLoader to accept new lines in quoted fields\" (#5125)"},{"Id":"620810508","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-19T20:17:35","Actor":"ThomasArdal","Number":"5142","RawContent":null,"Title":"Is it possible to avoid the runtimes folder in build output","State":"closed","Body":"I have included the `Microsoft.ML` and `Microsoft.ML.TimeSeries` packages in an ASP.NET Core 3.1 project.

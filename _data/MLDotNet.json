In my case, they are about 150 characters long. Name includes a-Z 0-9 and the dash character. ColumnInference reports them correctly. However, after starting training with AutoML, the columns are not used for training. If there are only long titles error about missing \"Features\" column is thrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1. Create dataset with long column names (numeric in my case)\r\n2.  Column inference reports them correctly:\r\n`ColumnInferenceResults columnInference = mlContext.Auto().InferColumns(TrainDataPath, LabelColumnName, groupColumns: false);`\r\n3. Train:\r\n                 `   experimentResult = experiment.Execute(TrainDataView, ValidationDataView, columnInformation, null, progressHandler);`\r\n4. Observe exception about missing Features.\r\n5. Rename columns to shorter manually, or in a loop to confirm training now works. This can be also used as a workaround for now.\r\n```\r\nvar copyPipeline= mlContext.Transforms.CopyColumns(\"col\" + i, col.Name);\r\nOriginalTrainDataView = pipeline.Fit(OriginalTrainDataView).Transform(OriginalTrainDataView);\r\n\r\n```\r\nNote: I have tree-based algorithms enabled.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nLong column names should be trained normally. \r\nIf not possible, an exception should be received. Now user might think all data is being used to train but actually some columns may be ignored.\r\n\r\nIt is possible Verbose level would give information about this, but it is disabled by default in AutoML. I did not run separately with verbose output.\r\n\r\n**Additional data**\r\nThere may be many reasons why dataset could include long column names. For example, they may have name, id and settings of a measurement device included in the column name.\r\n\r\nIf possible, I'd like to know what is currently the column length limit even if this would be fixed. That helps know which fields have been ignored in earlier models.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/6045","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Long Column names are unexpectedly dropped in training\" (#6045)"},{"Id":"1100612691","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-01-12T17:34:32","Actor":"michaelgsharp","Number":"6043","RawContent":null,"Title":"TestBackAndForthConversionWithAlphaNoInterleave disabled","State":"open","Body":"This issue is to track that the test TestBackAndForthConversionWithAlphaNoInterleave has been disabled for stability in the ARM legs of the CI builds.

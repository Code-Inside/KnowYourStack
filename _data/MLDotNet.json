The .NET ML Model Builder online documentation offers many learning resources, one of the more popular ones being _\"Tutorial: Train an ML.NET classification model to categorize images\"_    ...found here:\r\n\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/image-classification\r\n\r\nThe tutorial instructs the user to download an \"assets.zip\" file:  https://github.com/dotnet/samples/blob/main/machine-learning/tutorials/TransferLearningTF/image-classifier-assets.zip\r\n\r\n..and the inceptionV1 model :  https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/inception5h.zip\r\n\r\n...and then further steps in the tutorial allow the user to select Local (GPU) during the training environment step. After 3 tries of installing the wrong CUDA version containing incorrect binaries, I finally found the correct version only to be greeted with your unfortunate exception during the Train step.\r\n\r\nAfter spending hours compiling the machine learning repo from source, a little gotcha being needing to change the ps1 script to include --configuration and --platform arguments so as to compile successfully without needing Microsoft.ML.CpuMath native dll files, and attempting to circumvent your exception by changing your code, I stumbled upon a much easier win...\r\n\r\nWhen I found this tutorial:\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/image-classification-model-builder\r\n\r\nI was able to use these assets instead of the original files supplied by the earlier tutorial (not involving Azure/cloud etc), and then was able to train the model successfully and generate a solution using GPU.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMy suggestion to resolve this issue is choose one of the following:\r\n\r\n1. Take down the learning resource here as it only creates confusion when users are unable to follow the steps successfully:\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/image-classification\r\n\r\n2. Update the aforementioned resource, specifically the downloadable assets.zip and inception model to include a second class on the dataset.\r\n\r\n3. restore the corner-case of allowing a single class to be present.\r\n\r\nAs it may be tempting to do nothing in this particular scenario, as Microsoft prioritizes learning activities that use Azure cloud resources over on-premises installations, such as local VS 2022 + CUDA Toolkit etc., for monetary gain reaped from cloud subscription fees, I would remind you of Microsoft's commitment to support its entire product line, not just the high dollar solutions, and also of its assurance to the coding community of its desire for transparency and supporting open source technology and low barriers of entry concerning all things machine learning. With the advent of Open AI chatbot being available to use free of charge, I don't think MS can afford to lobotomize its more economy offerings in this way, unless y'all are playing the short game these days.

It's faster to calculate raw values and them to calculate validity for all values, than to skip calculation in case of one of the value is null (both operations are easy to vectorised in future). Exception is division (row value for null can be zero - have to avoid this operation)\r\n\r\n2) A lot of autogenerated lines of code are removed:\r\n\r\n   a) by moving cycle on buffers from PrimitiveDataFrameColumnArithmetic to PrimitiveColumnContainer level. This code is generic, so it's not necessary to duplicate it for every type alias. Internal cycle on each element inside span still stays on  PrimitiveDataFrameColumnArithmetic to avoid using virtual method inside the cycle (in theory calling virtual method is slightly slower, perhaps the overall difference is negligibly small). Exceptions are Comparison and ComparisonScalar operators - need to be fixed later, reason for not doing it now: max size of Boolean Buffer and T Buffer are different, that's why currently PrimitiveColumnContainer<bool> result is used on PrimitiveDataFrameColumnArithmetic instead of Span<bool>, this can be solved by using Memory<T> instead of Memory<byte> in DataFrameBuffer - will also increase performance of indexing (necessity of this change was already mentioned (https://github.com/dotnet/corefxlab/pull/2656/files#diff-d3a1807515a8785fb351fb67ecdae517d34c30f7d974b4631fcf65f0945510aaR21) - needs further investigation</br>\r\n  b) by using one method to perform operation - HandleOperation with operation type enum as parameter instead of several methods. Still there are a lot of lines of code for each method in BinaryOperationAPIs.ExplodedColumns and PrimitiveDataFrameColumn.BinaryOperationImplementations.Exploded - should be remediated with implementation of #5665 (improving the binary operations behavior when types mismatch). \r\n   TODO; BinaryOperation and BinaryScalarOperation enums should be combined into one enum, the same way as ComparisonOperation and ComparisonScalarOperation.

The quickest way to provide this information is in the class that defines the model input schema, you can use the `[VectorType(n)]` attribute where `n` is the size of your vector. Alternatively, you can use `SchemaDefinition` similar to this [sample](https://gist.github.com/luisquintanilla/b1367fd8ba000e455b2e43a23dafa645).

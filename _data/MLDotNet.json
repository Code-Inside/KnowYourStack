Load columns through column inference using the ColumnInformation class with categorical columns. \r\n2. Specify FastTree or LightGBM as trainer for an multiclassification experiment.\r\n3. The Exception occurs (see posted images below). I have tried using _mlContext.Data.LoadFromTextFile<T>() with load column attributes, but the same exception occurs. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nBy using the InfersColumn function, one should expec all the dependencies to be loaded. I have encountered problems with \"model not found.. *Some ONXX DLL* as well when trying to use the preview version,\r\n\r\n**Further Information**\r\nI'm getting an expecting Key<int32> exception after doing both trying onehoteconding on the categorical variable, as well as mapvaluetokey function.\r\n\r\nAll of this might be incoherent, but please state further question and I will specify it more clearly.\r\n\r\n![GitHubIssue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51839999/205415208-2635bbe0-40ee-4081-b21f-18f7e88d05ce.png)\r\n\r\n![Githubissue2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51839999/205415213-2061010d-4d4e-4080-8096-71e5c877dc7e.png)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/6517","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Multiclassification - LightGBM and FastTree not working as expected with infere column\" (#6517)"},{"Id":"1473550094","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-02T22:53:18","Actor":"zewditu","Number":"6516","RawContent":null,"Title":"Text classification  Predict result  is not calibrated.","State":"open","Body":"**System Information (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS & Version: [e.g. Windows 10] \r\n - ML.NET Version: [e.g. ML.NET v1.5.5]\r\n - .NET Version: [e.g. .NET 5.0]\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n1.

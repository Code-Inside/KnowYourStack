Please describe.**\nYes, it is.\nSome of our clients may have outdated encodings on their client application.\nWe still want our clients to have access to new encodings even if their client application is not up to date, hence we want to serve the encoder dictionary from a server endpoint.\n\n**A clear and concise description of what the problem is.**\nThe problem is that, currently, the Encoder property in TiktokenTokenizer is internal.\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/509032755b912e7bb0dd50c10a3172ead57965f3/src/Microsoft.ML.Tokenizers/Model/TiktokenTokenizer.cs#L998-L1001\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\nI would like to expose this Encoder property.\nThere seems to be the intent to expose this property at some point in the future.\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/509032755b912e7bb0dd50c10a3172ead57965f3/test/Microsoft.ML.Tokenizers.Tests/TiktokenTests.cs#L732-L740\n\nMaybe this is the time to do it, what do you think?\n\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\nMaybe a separate method that does exactly what that test from above does using reflection.\nSounds like overkill and a lot of overhead though.\nExposing the property is probably the best way to deal with this.\n\n**Additional context**\nI'm sending a PR your way with the changes, feel free to ask for/make any modifications you think are necessary.\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/7313","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Expose Encoder in TiktokenTokenizer\"

The first is using `.CancelExecution` from Microsoft.ML.Experimental but the experiment never stops and continues to the end which is more than 4 minutes after the `.CancelExecution` attempt.\n\n2. The second is trying the `CancellationToken = cts` but exactly as in above it never stops and continues to the end which is more than 4 minutes after the `cancellationTokenSource.Cancel();` attempt.\n\nIn both, the experiment continues to return 10,20,30+ models during those 4 minutes.\n\nHow would it be possible to actually cancel the Experiment on demand to not be stuck with the 300 seconds the experiment runs?

Everything works fine if I place my data in a CSV file, but in case, the data is already in memory as a List<DataPoint> because I am calculating Features. So instead of saving that to a CSV file and loading it back in again, I replaced this line:\r\n**TrainDataView = textLoader.Load(TrainDataPath);**\r\nwith:\r\n**TrainDataView = mlContext.Data.LoadFromEnumerable<DataPoint>(Data);**\r\n\r\nBoth are IDataViews, so I am guessing it should work. For the time being, I kept the ColumnInference working from the CSV file. But the regression fails.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to avoid saving/loading data?\r\n\r\n- **What happened?**\r\n=============== Running AutoML experiment ===============\r\n#########################################################\r\nRunning AutoML regression experiment...\r\nPress any key to stop the experiment run...\r\n|     Trainer                             RSquared Absolute-loss Squared-loss RMS-loss  Duration                 |\r\n|1    SdcaRegression                           NaN          0.00         0.00     0.00      15.8                 |\r\n1 models were returned after 15.92 seconds\r\n\r\n- **What did you expect?**\r\n=============== Running AutoML experiment ===============\r\n#########################################################\r\nRunning AutoML regression experiment...\r\nPress any key to stop the experiment run...\r\n|     Trainer                             RSquared Absolute-loss Squared-loss RMS-loss  Duration                 |\r\n|1    SdcaRegression                      -554.7830        460.07    368733.51   588.39       3.0                |\r\n|2    LightGbmRegression                  -151.0080        436.38    625374.63   702.75       1.3                |\r\n|3    FastTreeRegression                  -54.9780        267.71    287578.01   484.74       2.7                 |\r\n|4    FastTreeTweedieRegression            -1.6479        215.75    278471.13   450.67       1.2                 |\r\n|5    FastForestRegression                -32.4529        343.83    540098.80   627.91       1.8                 |\r\n|6    LbfgsPoissonRegression              -20.8898       1102.84  50035704.04  3150.17       0.9\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n\r\nPlease paste or attach the code or logs or traces that would be helpful to diagnose the issue you are reporting.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/5793","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"IDataView for experiments with AutoML\" (#5793)"},{"Id":"889600384","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-12T04:25:00","Actor":"hexate","Number":"5792","RawContent":null,"Title":"System.AccessViolationException' occurred in TensorFlow.NET.dll when calling predictionEngine.Predict()","State":"open","Body":"\r\n### System information\r\n\r\n- **OS version/distro**:\r\n- **.NET Version (eg., dotnet --info)**: \r\n\r\n.NET SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   5.0.103\r\n Commit:    72dec52dbd\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.19042\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\5.0.103\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 5.0.3\r\n  Commit:  c636bbdc8a\r\n\r\n.NET SDKs installed:\r\n  5.0.101 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  5.0.103 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.25 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.25 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.12 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.25 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.12 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.12 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 5.0.1 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 5.0.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\n- **What did you do?**\r\nTrying to create a prediction engine and then calling Predict() after loading a tensorflow model.

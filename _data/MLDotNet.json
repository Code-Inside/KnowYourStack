This only happens when the build is crossing 2 days as msbuild versioning is generating versioning file each day so when some project starts to build when the system time is crossing to new day, seems msbuild versioning can't handle this case and read empty BuildNumberMajor and BuildNumberMinor sometimes which cause the assembly version number to be a invalid format.\r\n\r\nI can repro this issue by set system time to a time very close to midnight, say 11:58 PM then start build from cmd, there is pretty good chance to repro the build version issue. Since we don't have a way to upgrade build tools now I will use default value of BuildNumberMajor and BuildNumberMinor to mitigate this issue.\r\n\r\n2. enhance logging","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5268","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"address build version issue and enhance logging\" (#5268)"},{"Id":"647580293","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-29T21:29:13","Actor":"frank-dong-ms","Number":"5265","RawContent":null,"Title":"make timeout larger as we are seeing timeouts in CI","State":"closed","Body":"we start to seeing timeouts in CI build so make the timeout larger, this is caused by sometimes download tensorflow meta files are slow(takes more than 10 minutes but normally this takes less than 1 minute), also CI tests runs slow than before:\r\n\r\nhttps://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/results?buildId=689649&view=logs&j=dd8eddb6-ecc6-5f65-73e6-df90e5693b94\r\nhttps://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/results?buildId=706453&view=logs&j=87172896-2df6-55a2-04c3-60b48f00f19f\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5265","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"make timeout larger as we are seeing timeouts in CI\" (#5265)"},{"Id":"647594596","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-29T18:58:31","Actor":"frank-dong-ms","Number":"5266","RawContent":null,"Title":"recent CI failure","State":"open","Body":"we are start seeing some ci failure recently:\r\n\r\nhttps://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/results?buildId=709641&view=results\r\nhttps://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/results?buildId=706523&view=results\r\nhttps://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/results?buildId=706453&view=results\r\nhttps://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/results?buildId=699015&view=results\r\nhttps://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/results?buildId=689649&view=results\r\nhttps://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/results?buildId=656357&view=results\r\n\r\nthere are several issues here:\r\n1. error CS7035: The specified version string does not conform to the recommended format - major.minor.build.revision\r\n\r\nhttps://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/results?buildId=656357&view=results\r\n\r\nthis also happens on local randomly\r\n\r\n2. fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/mongodb/homebrew-brew/': Failed to connect to github.com port 443: Operation timed out\r\n\r\nError: Fetching /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/mongodb/homebrew-brew failed!\r\nhttps://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_build/results?buildId=709641&view=logs&j=4b233af4-7b14-5f68-27c6-9c4d7ac87519&t=6c4d0d4f-93f4-59fe-bb3a-eecc956920fe\r\n\r\nlooks like random failure related to github authentication\r\n\r\n3.

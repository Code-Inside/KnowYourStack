This seemed to work correctly when we tested it with ORT 1.5.2, but it turns out that there was a memory leak on ORT itself, which got fixed for ORT 1.6.0 on this PR:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/5743\r\n\r\nAfter updating to 1.6.0, two of our tests were failing because of this: `TestOnnxZipMapWithInt64Keys` and `TestOnnxZipMapWithStringKeys`.\r\n\r\nThe bug on our implementation was that we weren't copying the output of sequences when we got them from ORT's output. And so when we called dispose on them, those outputs were gone. In the failing tests we call `ML.Data.CreateEnumerable()` from the output of OnnxTransformer, whereas the onnx model has output of type sequence. The problem was that when creating the enumerable, the listed objects appeared to have an empty enumerable as output. This got fixed by simply forcing the copy the output of ORT in the `CastOnnxSequenceToIEnumerable` into a new IEnumerable which is now returned to the user. This way, when we dispose the ORT's NamedOnnxValue output, we don't empty the actual IEnumerable that the user has.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5529","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Update to OnnxRuntime 1.6.0 and fixed bug with sequences outputs\" (#5529)"},{"Id":"762228918","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-11T10:48:16","Actor":"mentorfloat","Number":"5549","RawContent":null,"Title":"Predictions of converted LightGbm ONNX model completely mismatched ML.Net equivalent","State":"open","Body":"### System information\r\n\r\n- **OS version**: 10.0.19041\r\n- **.NET SDKs**: 3.1.402, 5.0.100-preview.7.20366.6\r\n\r\n### Issue\r\n\r\n- **What did you do?**\r\nConvert three trained ML.Net models (LightGbm, SdcaMaximumEntropy, LbfgsMaximumEntropy) to ONNX models with ConvertToOnnx and make predictions with 100 randomly selected data, using both the original ML.Net models and the converted ONNX models.\r\n\r\n- **What happened?**\r\nWhen making predictions with the converted LightGbm ONNX model, **none** of the predicted values match the predicted values made using the original ML.Net model.

Specifically, it creates the tokens for the `ApplyWordEmbedding` by removing numbers, keeping diacritics, and lowercases to match how the fastText model was created. The text cleaning reduces the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) issue in the word embedding. For any specific dataset, these options can be tested.\r\n\r\nSide note:\r\nWe should make a sample of `FeaturizeText` with `ApplyWordEmbedding`.

Even after the Onnx related memory leaks were fixed, memory usage kept increasing at each iteration. When I took memory snapshots at the beginning of each iteration I noticed that about 1400 `Single[]` objects were being leaked (amounting to about 180MB). \r\nThe allocation of these objects can be traced to the object pool implemented using `ConcurrentBag`. It appears that the `ConcurrentBag` objects stay on in memory associated with the threads. (I haven't figured how these should be disposed off correctly yet). But removing the objects in the pool gets rid of those objects from the managed heap by the start of the second iteration and memory usage remains far more stable across iterations.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes memory leaks in my local x86 builds.\r\n\r\nSince this is part of core ML.NET code that has been untouched for a long time, it is possible I may have overlooked something.

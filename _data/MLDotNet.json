Please describe.**\r\nCurrently, it is possible to specify a custom model loader when adding a `PredictionEnginePool` to the servicecollection, as mentioned in this pull request #4393 . This is important in cases where you want to, for example, load a specific version of a model from something like Azure Blob Storage.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the official documentation makes no mention at all of this possibility. So  this needs to be documented.\r\n\r\nSecondly, when you want to add a model loader that needs access to the service provider, the `AddPredictionEnginePool` requires an implementationfactory with a lot of boilerplate, like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\nservices.AddPredictionEnginePool<InputModel, OutputModel>(provider =>\r\n        {\r\n            \r\n            IEnumerable<IConfigureOptions<PredictionEnginePoolOptions<InputModel, OutputModel>>>\r\n                configureOptionsList =\r\n                    new List<IConfigureOptions<PredictionEnginePoolOptions<InputModel, OutputModel>>>()\r\n                    {\r\n                        new ConfigureOptions<PredictionEnginePoolOptions<InputModel, OutputModel>>(options=>\r\n                            options.ModelLoader = new AzureModelLoader(provider))\r\n                    };\r\n            \r\n            IEnumerable<IPostConfigureOptions<PredictionEnginePoolOptions<InputModel, OutputModel>>>\r\n                postConfigures =\r\n                    new List<IPostConfigureOptions<PredictionEnginePoolOptions<InputModel, OutputModel>>>();\r\n            \r\n            var optionsfactory =\r\n                new OptionsFactory<PredictionEnginePoolOptions<InputModel, OutputModel>>(\r\n                    configureOptionsList,postConfigures);\r\n\r\n            return new PredictionEnginePool<InputModel, OutputModel>(provider,\r\n                provider.GetRequiredService<IOptions<MLOptions>>(), optionsfactory);\r\n        });\r\n```\r\nIt is also possible to add it through `AddOptions` like this:\r\n```\r\nservices.AddOptions<PredictionEnginePoolOptions<InputModel, OutputModel>>().Configure(options =>\r\n        {\r\n            options.ModelLoader = new ModelLoader();\r\n        });\r\n```\r\nBut this does not allow access to the serviceprovider.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n 1. Document this feature.\r\n 2. Add a method to configure the `PredictionEnginePoolOptions`  with the serviceprovider as a parameter:\r\n\r\n```\r\nservices.AddPredictionEnginePoolOptions<InputModel, OutputModel>((provider, options) =>\r\n        {\r\n            options.ModelLoader = new ModelLoader(provider);\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nUsing the `AddOptions` method.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nAdd any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/6618","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Improvements when specifying a ModelLoader when adding a predictionenginepool to DI.\" (#6618)"},{"Id":"1657573761","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-06T14:50:06","Actor":"dietrichha","Number":"6617","RawContent":null,"Title":"Daily recurring AutoML experiment - losses best Model","State":"open","Body":"### Issue\r\n\r\nIn order to predict best prices, I do an AutoML regression expermient as explained here:\r\n\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/how-to-guides/how-to-use-the-automl-api\r\n\r\nAnd safe the best Model with: \r\nmlContext.Model.Save(experimentResult.Model, trainDataView.Schema, modelFilePath);\r\n\r\nAnd also print the Model R-Squared from the best found model.\r\n\r\nTo quickly adapt to new changes, I redo the AutoML expermient on a daily basis at 2 o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nWhen I look at the R2s they change daily between 0.7 and 0.95. \r\n\r\nHowever, I save the model regardless of the last one, i overwrite the 0.95 R2 model with e.g. the 0.7 R2 model.

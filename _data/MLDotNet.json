A plot of the predicted values is what researchers want to see.  A table is not good enough.  If you plot the predicted values generated by Model Builder you will see how bad the predictions are.

I suppose the disadvantage maybe unnecessary precision in some columns, however the default value could still be float. This would probably be the simplest change.\r\n\r\n**Enhance Dtypes Parameter**\r\nAlternatively it would be nice to modify the Dtypes[] parameter in Read_Csv to be a dictionary such that we can specify the particular type we want for a given column name. This will make it a little more robust. (I have customer data with the column names in different orders/ shifted in excel etc. It would be nicer to not have to rely on indexing). The disadvantage here is that we would have to check that column names exist etc.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/6347","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Precision loss When Reading in CSV data\" (#6347)"},{"Id":"1391793672","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-30T04:09:22","Actor":"crazyoutlook","Number":"6346","RawContent":null,"Title":"Using Variables as parameters instead of constant in ML.NET","State":"open","Body":"**System Information (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS & Version: [e.g. Windows 10] - Windows 10\r\n - ML.NET Version: [e.g. ML.NET v1.5.5] - ML.Net 1.4\r\n - .NET Version: [e.g. .NET 5.0] - .Net 6.0\r\n\r\n**Describe the bug**\r\nA clear and concise description of what the bug is.\r\nI have some attribute value in code which is being used in ML.Net code.

This payload includes the PInvoke infrastructure to call XGBoost (version 1.5 and above... current version is 1.7).  It mimics the design of the LightGBM integration as much as possible.  Most notable difference is that it does not serialize to `InternalEnsembleTree`, but uses its own model (also it uses the JSON dump to build such a model, but that's an implementation detail).   The actual Estimator/Transformer pair is preliminary, as it looks more like a standard transformation than a learner (in that the Model is not an independent entity).

Please describe.**\r\nI'm using the prediction engine pool from a URI as such:\r\n\r\n```\r\nservices.AddPredictionEnginePool<ModelInput, ModelOutput>().FromUri(\r\n    uri: $\"{URI}\",\r\n    period: TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5));\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is working great. However, I'd like to be able to get the engine pool updated on demand, rather than waiting up to 5 minutes for it to refresh itself.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nPerhaps a method on the `PredictionEnginePool` class that allows for a refresh i.e. `predictionEnginePool.RefreshFromUri()`\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nCan certainly shorten the period, but it seems unnecessary to have it checking every 30 seconds when I know exactly when it needs to update.\r\n\r\nIt could also be a local file using `FromFile` but the model lives elsewhere and I'd like it to stay that way.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIs this something that has been explored at all?

The default implementation for `ITrialResultManager` is `CsvTrialResultManager`, which saves all trial results in csv format\r\n\r\n## What's `ITrialResultManager` used for\r\nCurrently, it's used by some tuners (CostFrugalTuner, for example) to recover from previous training, suppose trialResult csv is provided or is available.\r\n\r\n## How to use it\r\n`ITrialResultManager` is not directly exposed to public users. User can use `SetCheckpoint(string folder)` path instead. If a folder is provided via `SetCheckpoint`, `AutoMLExperiment` will create that folder if not exists, and configures `CsvTrialResultManager` to save trial results to `folder/trialResults.csv`.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/6335","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add ITrialResultManager for continue training in AutoML\" (#6335)"},{"Id":"1379604385","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-20T15:24:05","Actor":"luisquintanilla","Number":"6334","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add ReplaceMissingTimeSeriesValues to docs","State":"open","Body":"Add [`ReplaceMissingTimeSeriesValues`](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/0577957256c296fdea2deb6b6e00e7be9b458167/src/Microsoft.ML.Featurizers/TimeSeriesImputer.cs) to reference API docs.

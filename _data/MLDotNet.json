The model produced by the API provides accurate prediction, with reasonable results in the following metrics: MicroAccuracy, MacroAccuracy, LogLoss & LogLossReduction. Trying to get metrics on what feature selection was implemented by the API is proving impossible however. \r\n\r\n- Following all direction & [documentation ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/how-to-guides/explain-machine-learning-model-permutation-feature-importance-ml-net#explain-the-model-with-permutation-feature-importance-pfi) on implementing the PermutationFeatureImportance method has no success. It is possible to extract the pipeline from the AutoML BestRun model, and putting together the list of features in the custom class type it is using is not a problem either. However, there would appear to be no LastTransformer attribute for the BestRun model produced by the API. According to the official documentation on how to execute the PFI method on multiclass model, this is one of the main hurdles. \r\n\r\n- Attempting to follow the specific Multiclassification PFI [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.ml.permutationfeatureimportanceextensions.permutationfeatureimportance?view=ml-dotnet#Microsoft_ML_PermutationFeatureImportanceExtensions_PermutationFeatureImportance__1_Microsoft_ML_MulticlassClassificationCatalog_Microsoft_ML_ISingleFeaturePredictionTransformer___0__Microsoft_ML_IDataView_System_String_System_Boolean_System_Nullable_System_Int32__System_Int32_) more exact, and defining a new pipeline with single multiclassification algorithm still throws an error. This is not ideal, as the new pipeline definition with single multiclassification algorithm does not necessarily match that used by the AutoML API's model, which is the model the PFI metrics are needed for.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Source code / logs\r\n\r\n**Example code following Multiclassification PFI Implementation from [ML.Net Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.ml.permutationfeatureimportanceextensions.permutationfeatureimportance?view=ml-dotnet#Microsoft_ML_PermutationFeatureImportanceExtensions_PermutationFeatureImportance__1_Microsoft_ML_MulticlassClassificationCatalog_Microsoft_ML_ISingleFeaturePredictionTransformer___0__Microsoft_ML_IDataView_System_String_System_Boolean_System_Nullable_System_Int32__System_Int32_), using pipeline extracted from AutoML bestRun Model:** \r\n```\r\n//PFI code attempting to extract and use pipeline from AutoML bestRun model\r\n            var featureColumns =\r\n                new string[] { \"Unnamed0\",\"FlowID\",\"SourceIP\",\"SourcePort\",\"DestinationIP\",\"DestinationPort\",\"Protocol\",\"Timestamp\",\"FlowDuration\",\"TotalFwdPackets\",\"TotalBackwardPackets\",\"TotalLengthofFwdPackets\",\"TotalLengthofBwdPackets\",\"FwdPacketLengthMax\",\"FwdPacketLengthMin\",\"FwdPacketLengthMean\",\"FwdPacketLengthStd\",\"BwdPacketLengthMax\",\"BwdPacketLengthMin\",\"BwdPacketLengthMean\",\"BwdPacketLengthStd\",\"FlowBytes\",\"FlowPackets\",\"FlowIATMean\",\"FlowIATStd\",\"FlowIATMax\",\"FlowIATMin\",\"FwdIATTotal\",\"FwdIATMean\",\"FwdIATStd\",\"FwdIATMax\",\"FwdIATMin\",\"BwdIATTotal\",\"BwdIATMean\",\"BwdIATStd\",\"BwdIATMax\",\"BwdIATMin\",\"FwdPSHFlags\",\"BwdPSHFlags\",\"FwdURGFlags\",\"BwdURGFlags\",\"FwdHeaderLength\",\"BwdHeaderLength\",\"FwdPackets\",\"BwdPackets\",\"MinPacketLength\",\"MaxPacketLength\",\"PacketLengthMean\",\"PacketLengthStd\",\"PacketLengthVariance\",\"FINFlagCount\",\"SYNFlagCount\",\"RSTFlagCount\",\"PSHFlagCount\",\"ACKFlagCount\",\"URGFlagCount\",\"CWEFlagCount\",\"ECEFlagCount\",\"DownUpRatio\",\"AveragePacketSize\",\"AvgFwdSegmentSize\",\"AvgBwdSegmentSize\",\"FwdHeaderLength1\",\"FwdAvgBytesBulk\",\"FwdAvgPacketsBulk\",\"FwdAvgBulkRate\",\"BwdAvgBytesBulk\",\"BwdAvgPacketsBulk\",\"BwdAvgBulkRate\",\"SubflowFwdPackets\",\"SubflowFwdBytes\",\"SubflowBwdPackets\",\"SubflowBwdBytes\",\"Init_Win_bytes_forward\",\"Init_Win_bytes_backward\",\"act_data_pkt_fwd\",\"min_seg_size_forward\",\"ActiveMean\",\"ActiveStd\",\"ActiveMax\",\"ActiveMin\",\"IdleMean\",\"IdleStd\",\"IdleMax\",\"IdleMin\",\"SimillarHTTP\",\"Inbound\" };\r\n\r\n            // Fit the pipeline to the data.\r\n            var PFI_model = bestRun.Estimator.Fit(trainDataView);\r\n\r\n            // Transform the dataset.\r\n            var transformedData = PFI_model.Transform(trainDataView);\r\n\r\n            // Extract the predictor.\r\n            var linearPredictor = PFI_model.LastTransformer;\r\n\r\n            // Compute the permutation metrics for the linear model using the\r\n            // normalized data.\r\n            var permutationMetrics = mlContext.MulticlassClassification\r\n                .PermutationFeatureImportance(linearPredictor, transformedData,\r\n                permutationCount: 30);\r\n\r\n            // Now let's look at which features are most important to the model\r\n            // overall.

I chose a scenario, selected my features/label, trained the model and generated the code with the new model trained.\r\n- **What did you expect?** I was able to load the model saved and create new predictions with it. However, when I tried to retrain the model, using the ConsoleApp project generated by ML.Net Builder, it throws OperationCanceledException in the process. More specifically, I call the method \"CreateModel()\" from the class ModelBuilder in the ConsoleApp project (that is generated automatically by ML.Net Model Builder when you want to generate the code), then it trains the model but there's always a OperationCanceledException that is thrown.

This PR changes the the default value for NGramLength from 1 to 2 and also changes FastTree so it handles sparse data better.\r\n\r\nThe main portion of the sparse data change is changing from an array to a dictionary so that memory is only allocated when its needed instead of all up front.

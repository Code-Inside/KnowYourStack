In some cases, `MemoryMarshal.Read<T>`, `MemoryMarshal.Write<T>`, and `MemoryMarshal.AsBytes<T>` are used.\r\n\r\nThough these three methods are normally unsafe-equivalent APIs, they are guaranteed safe when _T_ is a primitive integral or floating point type, char, or an enum thereof. (That is, it's guaranteed safe when _T_ is byte, sbyte, short, ushort, char, int, uint, long, ulong, int128, uint128, nint, nuint, float, double, Half, or an enum of any of these.)\r\n\r\nI've left code comments where things couldn't be made fully safe. I've also opted _not_ to touch some code in VectorUtils.cs. I only touched code where the loop logic is simple enough for the JIT (even the older netfx JIT!) to always elide bounds checks. I didn't touch code paths where multiple buffers were being touched at once since the JIT doesn't yet properly elide bounds checks in those cases, and I didn't want to risk a possible perf regression.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/7426","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Reduce usage of unsafe constructs throughout codebase\" (#7426)"},{"Id":"2934642077","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-20T09:12:45","Actor":"Dharam090909","Number":"7428","RawContent":null,"Title":"my application stuck at pipeline.fit()","State":"open","Body":"I have developed application using windows form application by using ML.net but during pipeline.fit() application hang without error.I have already tested same code into other CPU that having same issue.\n\nMy code only running good with visual studio developer system only .","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/7428","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"my application stuck at pipeline.fit()\" (#7428)"},{"Id":"2929950255","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-19T20:50:54","Actor":"tarekgh","Number":"7425","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support ByteLevel encoding in Bpe tokenizer to support DeepSeek model","State":"closed","Body":"This change includes:  \r\n\r\n- Adding support for **ByteLevel encoding** in the BPE tokenizer.  \r\n- Introducing a new `BpeTokenizer.Create` method that allows creating a tokenizer using the newly introduced `BpeOptions` type. This enables users to obtain tokenizer data from various sources (e.g., `tokenizer.json` files) and instantiate the tokenizer using this new factory method.  \r\n- Expanding test coverage to validate ByteLevel support.  \r\n- Adding a test that loads the real [tokenizer.json](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1/blob/main/tokenizer.json) for the **DeepSeek R1** model and verifies its functionality. Since the DeepSeek tokenizer utilizes ByteLevel encoding, it serves as an ideal test case for this feature.  \r\n- Providing test code for loading `tokenizer.json`, which can be used as a template for loading other models' tokenizers when needed.\r\n- Introducing the CompositePreTokenizer to support the DeepSeek pre-tokenization scenario.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/7425","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Support ByteLevel encoding in Bpe tokenizer to support DeepSeek model\" (#7425)"},{"Id":"2926408304","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-03-17T21:20:32","Actor":"LittleLittleCloud","Number":"7424","RawContent":null,"Title":"Increase cancelling waiting time for AutoMLExperiment_return_current_best_trial_when_ct_is_canceled_with_trial_completed_Async","State":"open","Body":"We are excited to review your PR.\r\n\r\nSo we can do the best job, please check:\r\n\r\n- [ ] There's a descriptive title that will make sense to other developers some time from now. \r\n- [ ] There's associated issues.

Using the float method caused the button to not be taken into account in the sections height, so it sat on top of the bottom padding of the section, and required additional styling to allow for space below it to avoid the button being at the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have a simple class to create a flex container and the align or justify items inside with modifiers, something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"is-flex is-justified-end\">\r\n      <button class=\"button\">Save Changes</button>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could be accomplished using `.columns` but seems a bit too much work having to offset columns to align them","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3008","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Flexbox utilities and helper classes to create flex elements\" (#3008)"},{"Id":"642713370","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-22T03:03:44","Actor":"gahia","Number":"3007","RawContent":null,"Title":"Horizontal field responsiveness ","State":"open","Body":"This is about **Bulma**.\r\nThis is **Feature**.\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\nI'm using Bulma **version** [0.9.0]\r\nMy **browser** is: Firefox 77.0.1 (64-bit)\r\nI am almost sure this issue is **not a duplicate**, I didn't found an issue or PR about this.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis is about having responsiveness classes for horizontal fields in order to define when a field becomes horizontal.\r\n\r\nI think it could be useful to have it ready made in Bulma Framework.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAn .is-desktop class would make the field become horizontal only after 1024px (desktop)... and the same idea for all other breakpoints.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nAt this moment, an .is-horizontal field become horizontal after 769px (tablet).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3007","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Horizontal field responsiveness \" (#3007)"},{"Id":"642562591","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-21T13:21:36","Actor":"tontonsb","Number":"3006","RawContent":null,"Title":"Content overflows it's tile in the new Chrome","State":"open","Body":"### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\nMy **browser** is: Chrome 83.0.4103.106\r\nI am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**?

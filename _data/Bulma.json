We currently use Bulma in production, but we've had several issues which we ended up having to solve by going to great wavelengths, which could be just easily fixed by merging a Pull Request.\r\n\r\nHow is it that a lot of popular issues do not really get addressed despite being very popular & being open since early 2018-2019, but I'm seeing sponsoring options everywhere?\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to bash on Bulma or anything, we use it in production, but we've had tremendous amount of work in customisation and basic things Bulma does not provide out of the box (which, in my opinion, it should). I've also seen plenty of issues (which were great ideas) being quickly disregarded by the author, instead of being properly addressed.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it seems as though more work is being put in the sponsoring/commercialising of Bulma (which is everywhere, for some reason) than there is in actually improving the framework by useful features and optimizations. Bootstrap (and Buefy), for example, rarely or never even ask for sponsoring of any kind of financial compensations.\r\n\r\nI am not against sponsoring or helping out, but community help such as issues & recommendations like these are worth much more than a couple sponsors (in my opinion).\r\n\r\n@jgthms If you need to make a revenue in order to sustain Bulma, I'd recommend creating/building themes, like Bootstrap does, https://themes.getbootstrap.com/ -- and selling them in order to also provide value to end-users who would like to financially contribute by getting a theme & saving time in the process.\r\n\r\nAgain, great work on Bulma, but I've seen a lot of nearly instant negativity on issues being opened that actually contain great feedback & solutions. I've seen plenty of people having to create custom CSS in Bulma issues because the issue got disregarded and was never even closed as well.\r\n\r\n### Examples (Issues)\r\n#### Search\r\n- Issue #2936. \r\n- Issue #1325, contains tons of people complaining about no response to issues. \r\n\r\n#### Docs\r\nPlenty of people complain about the documentation having too many clicks, difficult searching & just lacking behind in terms of other documentation sites / options (such as, Vue.js, Bootstrap, etc.). \r\n\r\n### Examples (Pull Requests)\r\n#### Search\r\n- Issue #2936. \r\n- Issue #1325, contains tons of people complaining about no response to issues. \r\n\r\nPRs mentioning the docs: https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+docs -- contain plenty of pull requests with documentation improvements, not being merged.\r\n\r\nThere's way too much pull requests opened, with no response and nothing. Issues & feedback requests as well.\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\nI didn't have time to list everything here, but if you just look thoroughly through every issue & Pull Request in this repository, you can see a lot of issues being quickly disregarded + pull request criticism & after that; no response. \r\n\r\nInstead of focusing on sponsors @jgthms -- you can improve the community, which would eliminate the need for financial support? I'm not very understanding of the desperate need for sponsors, if this is a community based / open source project anyway. No harm to you, but Bulma is the most commercialised repository / open source project I've ever seen on GitHub, or anywhere for that matter. I'd suggest making money some other way, like I mentioned (using Themes).\r\n\r\n### Proposed solutions\r\nTry getting new people / managers on board, move to a 'bulmacss' GitHub Teams, invite people and get more people in the repository.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3074","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Bulma, step up your game\" (#3074)"},{"Id":"672697512","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-04T10:49:27","Actor":"simplenotezy","Number":"3073","RawContent":null,"Title":"Buggy behavior when upgrading from 0.8.2 to 0.9","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\nThis is about **Bulma**.\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading to 0.9 from 0.8.2, it looks like this:\r\n\r\n**0.9.0**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3786627/89285255-529d7500-d650-11ea-8976-2a36d0623ab2.png)\r\n\r\n**0.8.2**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3786627/89285476-ba53c000-d650-11ea-8932-78c4d0e98c26.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

I've been able to reproduce it only on mobile Safari\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\nI'm using Bulma **version** [0.8.2]\r\nMy **browser** is: Safari iOS (iPhone 7)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI'm creating a navbar for a current project in react (create-react-app). I'm using the Bulma framework for all css-related things. The current problem lies in the navigation bar, the elements of which should together be centered and visible on mobile.\r\n\r\nWhile this isn't possible with Bulma alone, I used some scss modifications I've found to make it somewhat work:\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n#### App.scss Stylesheets\r\n```css\r\n.navbar-start { // fixes is-expanded on the navbar items\r\n    flex-grow: 1;\r\n    flex-shrink: 1;\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    text-align: center;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.navbar-item {\r\n    border-style: solid;\r\n    border-color: black;\r\n    border-width: medium;\r\n}\r\n\r\n#center-item {\r\n    border-right-width: 0;\r\n    border-left-width: 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### HTML (navbar only)\r\n```html\r\n<div>\r\n  <nav className=\"navbar is-dark\" role=\"navigation\" aria-label=\"main navigation\">\r\n    <div className=\"container has-text-centered \">\r\n      <div className=\"navbar-menu\">\r\n        <div className=\"navbar-start\">\r\n          <Link className=\"navbar-item is-expanded has-text-weight-semibold is-size-5\" to=\"/\">/home</Link>\r\n          <Link id=\"center-item\" className=\"navbar-item is-expanded has-text-weight-semibold is-size-5\" to=\"/visual\">/visual</Link>\r\n          <Link className=\"navbar-item is-expanded has-text-weight-semibold is-size-5\" to=\"/about\">/about</Link>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </nav>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nFinally, to make this horizontal navbar visible on mobile, I've also modified a bulma variable according to [this](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/1445) in the scss file.: `$navbar-breakpoint: 0`.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n![Image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/LGVrL.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThere should be no empty space.\r\n\r\n### Additional details\r\nLive website: http://51.15.246.99\r\nProject source code: https://github.com/visual-cs/site\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3055","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Bulma centered navbar mobile issues\" (#3055)"},{"Id":"663583082","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-07-22T08:40:11","Actor":"amresha","Number":"3054","RawContent":null,"Title":"Responsiveness of columns","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma | the Docs**.\r\n\r\n<!-- Is it about Bulma or about the Docs? -->\r\n<!-- Is it a bug/feature/question or do you need help? -->\r\n<!-- If it's a bug, is it a browser bug? -->\r\n\r\nI need help in creating responsive 3 column layout.\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma CSS framework\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **Docs** -->\r\n<!-- I'm using Bulma **version** [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- My **browser** is: -->\r\n<!-- This is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- I am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**? -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Description of the bug, enhancement, or question -->\r\nI am facing issue in the responsiveness of columns.

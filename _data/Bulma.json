\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen adding bulma to Nuxt modules, vite server starts up really slowly, up to a minute for some users. It has already been raised as Nuxt and Vite github issues but devs there have said bulma is the cause.\r\n\r\nOne interesting comment (https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/13824) says bulma uses old division code from Bootstrap, which is the underlying cause. Please investigate and issue fix if that is the case.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create new Nuxt project using `npx nuxi init nuxt-test`\r\n2. `code nuxt-test`\r\n3. `yarn install`\r\n4.  Start `vite` server, it starts up within a few seconds\r\n5.  `yarn add bulma`\r\n6.  Add `bulma` to `css` property:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\r\n  css: [\r\n    'bulma',\r\n  ]\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n8. Start `vite` server using `yarn dev -o` now it takes anywhere from 20 seconds to a minute\r\n9. Take out `bulma` from css property and `vite` will start up in 3 seconds.\r\n\r\nPlease see https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/11221 and https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/13824\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nVite should start up quickly, as that is one of its major features.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nVite starts up real slow (possibly due to some division loops within bulma code -- see description)\r\n\r\nWith bulma:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47725053/208984240-45ad269f-8447-4adf-8c7d-5aebfccfc9f3.png)\r\n\r\nWithout:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47725053/208984464-34431ca9-25fc-414a-8f35-63140db7dd90.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3604","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Importing bulma in Nuxt 3 config css property causes super slow Vite startup\" (#3604)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2023-04-05T03:30:10.4305332Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":659}

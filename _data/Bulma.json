Reference that issue as well. -->\r\n\r\nThe current `card-footer-item` implementation does not support buttons well and relies on anchor elements, which goes against A11y principles, as mentioned in [#953](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/953).\r\n\r\nI also changed the wording of the card-footer description in the docs.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n<!-- Which specific problem does this PR solve and how?  -->\r\n<!-- If it fixes a particular Issue, add \"Fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER\" in your title -->\r\nAdd styles to the `button.card-footer-item` selector to give them the look and feel of the existing `a.card-footer-item`.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\n<!-- What are the drawbacks of this solution? Are there alternative ones? -->\r\n<!-- Think of performance, build time, usability, complexity, coupling…) -->\r\n\r\nThe way I implemented may break one of the styleguide rules (Use only classes). I styled `button.card-footer-item` as opposed to `.button.card-footer-item` to allow for color modifiers to override the color I added to match the anchor tags. It's possible to make the improvement styling `.button.card-footer-item`, but color modifications (e.g. from `.is-primary`) won't be honored.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nI've only tested the docs and the behavior of `button.card-footer-item.is-primary` and `button.card-footer-item.is-ghost`. Considering the scope of the change and my limited understanding of the framework, I didn't know what else to test.\r\n\r\n<!-- BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR PR, MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS: -->\r\n<!-- 1.

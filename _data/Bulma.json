This is how it'd look in code:\r\n```\r\n<button class=\"button is-primary is-rounded\">Hello</button>\r\n<button class=\"button is-primary is-rounded\">World!</button>\r\n<button class=\"button is-primary is-rounded\">I</button>\r\n<button class=\"button is-link is-rounded\">Am</button>\r\n<button class=\"button is-link\">A</button>\r\n<button class=\"button is-primary\">Programmer</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n<span class=\"buttons are-primary are-rounded\">\r\n  <button class=\"button\">Hello</button>\r\n  <button class=\"button\">World!</button>\r\n  <button class=\"button\">I</button>\r\n  <button class=\"button\">Am</button>\r\n  <button class=\"button is-link is-squared\">A</button>\r\n  <button class=\"button is-squared\">Programmer</button>\r\n</span>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How to Implement\r\n\r\nTo implement it's fairly simple but tedious. The simplest method would be to add it to all button color states and the `is-rounded`. This way all nested buttons that use a different color can still override the default `buttons` color, just like with size. For e.g.\r\n```\r\n.button.is-rounded, .buttons.are-rounded .button {\r\n  border-radius: 9999px;\r\n  padding-left: calc(1em + 0.25em);\r\n  padding-right: calc(1em + 0.25em);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.button.is-primary, .buttons.are-primary .button {\r\n  background-color: hsl(171, 100%, 41%);\r\n  border-color: transparent;\r\n  color: #fff;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note: Some clarification may have to be made with how `is-toggle-rounded` would work in this example, or alternatively it can be dropped and replaced with `is-squared` or similar. This is to allow removing the roundness of a `button` in a `buttons` nest.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3710","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[FEATURE RQ] Buttons element should have button specifics\" (#3710)"},{"Id":"2074355080","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-10T13:15:05","Actor":"EvgenyKhlivetsky","Number":"3709","RawContent":null,"Title":"Feat/colors fonts update","State":"closed","Body":"Update accent color to be green, change fonts, change scheme color","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/3709","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Feat/colors fonts update\" (#3709)"},{"Id":"2057866736","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-28T00:29:45","Actor":"jorvis","Number":"3707","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add documentation for which elements can't be within a dropdown-item element.

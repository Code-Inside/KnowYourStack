Particularly how the `is-narrow-*` classes interact with the other width classes of the grid system, e.g., `is-one-quarter-*` .\r\n\r\nI'm using Bulma **version** [0.8.2]\r\n\r\nMight be related to #2783 -- Not clear: description in that issue is not too verbose.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nConsider the following snippet\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"columns\">\r\n  <div class=\"column is-one-quarter-tablet is-narrow-desktop\">\r\n    <code>is-one-quarter-tablet</code><br>\r\n    <code>is-narrow-desktop</code><br>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"column\">2</div>\r\n  <div class=\"column\">3</div>\r\n  <div class=\"column\">4</div>\r\n  <div class=\"column\">5</div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nYou would expect this to be a quarter sized column at the tablet break point. And then be a narrow column for the desktop and larger breakpoints.\r\n\r\nAt least this is what is implied in the documentation sections `Different column sizes per breakpoint` and `Narrow column`.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe column is quarter sized for all breakpoints larger than tablet.\r\n\r\n### Potential Solution\r\n\r\nIt seems that the `width` field set in \r\n\r\n```sass\r\n&.is-one-quarter-tablet\r\n  flex: none\r\n  width: 25%\r\n```\r\n is never `unset` in \r\n```sass\r\n&.is-narrow-desktop\r\n  flex: none\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems to be what #2783 is pointing to.\r\n\r\nEither the documentation should be changed to clarify this, or the width should be unset (I am not sure if this interacts badly with any other Bulma components).","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2937","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"is-narrow inconsistent\" (#2937)"},{"Id":"615081712","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-09T03:34:48","Actor":"yousefamar","Number":"2936","RawContent":null,"Title":"Please consider having all the docs on a single page","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **the Docs**.\r\n\r\n<!-- Is it about Bulma or about the Docs? -->\r\n<!-- Is it a bug/feature/question or do you need help? -->\r\n<!-- If it's a bug, is it a browser bug? -->\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **CSS framework** -->\r\nThis is about the Bulma **Docs**\r\n<!-- I'm using Bulma **version** [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- My **browser** is: -->\r\n<!-- This is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [x.x.x] -->\r\nI have searched for a duplicate issue and not found any.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCan you _please_ consider having all the docs on a single page like every other CSS framework? I can't express how much of a nightmare it is to browse those docs. It's incredibly difficult to find what I need, and even when I know where it is, I still have to click through several things to get there. If it was all on a single page, I could ctrl-f to anything I needed instantly.\r\n\r\nThis would also be really beneficial for onboarding new developers, as they would be able to scroll through and see everything that bulma has to offer. I didn't know certain things were possible, until I stumbled upon them by chance in the docs while looking for something else. This is made worse by the fact that the sections/subsections are organised in a way that isn't very intuitive to me. I would much rather be able to just search something like \"center\" and see if there are classes related to centering, etc.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2936","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Please consider having all the docs on a single page\" (#2936)"},{"Id":"613821760","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-07T06:58:40","Actor":"locness3","Number":"2935","RawContent":null,"Title":"Composer package","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma**.\r\nThis is an feature request.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWould be great, if someone's available to, to create a composer package for use in PHP apps.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2935","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Composer package\" (#2935)"},{"Id":"613328490","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-06T13:39:49","Actor":"peterfealey","Number":"2934","RawContent":null,"Title":"Feature Request 'is-bold' for any element","State":"open","Body":"This is about Bulma, and is a Feature request.\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI would love the `is-primary` `is-bold` hero modifiers that create a nice gradient background, and automatically styles text to the appropriate colour, to work on any element.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2934","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feature Request 'is-bold' for any element\" (#2934)"},{"Id":"611226173","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-03T18:41:04","Actor":"raphaellueckl","Number":"2932","RawContent":null,"Title":"Publish to unpkg","State":"closed","Body":"https://unpkg.com/browse/bulma@0.8.2\r\n\r\nDoes not exist.

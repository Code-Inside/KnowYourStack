Are there alternative ones? -->\r\n<!-- Think of performance, build time, usability, complexity, coupling…) -->\r\n\r\nThe way I implemented may break one of the styleguide rules (Use only classes). I styled `button.card-footer-item` as opposed to `.button.card-footer-item` to allow for color modifiers to override the color I added to match the anchor tags. It's possible to make the improvement styling `.button.card-footer-item`, but color modifications (e.g. from `.is-primary`) won't be honored.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nI've only tested the docs and the behavior of `button.card-footer-item.is-primary` and `button.card-footer-item.is-ghost`. Considering the scope of the change and my limited understanding of the framework, I didn't know what else to test.\r\n\r\n<!-- BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR PR, MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS: -->\r\n<!-- 1.

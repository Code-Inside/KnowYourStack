The `.container` class that I wrap my two-column page in has a max width of 1344px, which means that my monitor has more white space than content. (3440px monitor - 1344px of content = 2096px of whitespace)\r\n\r\nNow, I get that designing for these is difficult so I'd fully understand if they're just beyond the scope of what's reasonable to implement at this time (as they aren't super common, so diminishing returns on effort) but I'm wondering if there are any plans to add a larger breakpoint than fullscreen for monitors like mine?\r\n\r\nI do appreciate that I can edit these vars myself, and even if I did, widescreens would likely need an edited UI regardless. \r\n\r\nJust curious as towards your thoughts on if this is something worth implementing.

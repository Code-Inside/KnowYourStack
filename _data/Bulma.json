These new rules ensure that the utility size classes take precedence, allowing developers to directly control the size of icons within input controls as intended.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nNo significant tradeoffs are introduced with this solution. The change is highly targeted and increases specificity in a logical way that aligns with the intended use of utility classes. It doesn't add complexity or affect other components.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nThe Sass code was successfully compiled using the project's build script (`npm run build-bulma`) to ensure there were no syntax errors. The logical change in CSS specificity directly addresses the reported bug. Visual confirmation would typically be done by inspecting an HTML page using these classes, but the fix is based on fundamental CSS specificity rules.\r\n\r\n<!-- BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR PR, MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS: -->\r\n<!-- 1.

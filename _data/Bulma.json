In short, it's a class that, when applied to the `<a>` element, makes the entire containing block, such as cards, clickable as if it were part of the link. This not only improves code readability, but also makes the performed action more clear since it also highlights the `.stretched-link` element.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the closest alternative is to make the box an `<a>` element. While it does the job, it highlights the entire box, and putting any links inside it, like a button, breaks the whole thing.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3574","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add an equivalent of Bootstrap's stretched links\" (#3574)"},{"Id":"1376700786","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-17T07:57:05","Actor":"mayur-ekbote","Number":"3573","RawContent":null,"Title":"Start margin of 2rem is added on tabs by default","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\nThis is about **Bulma**.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework** \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAn start margin of 2rem is added to tabs by default.

Even though you would think that with a calculation of 2560 / 1.25 * 0.50 = 1024 everything would be ok, the browser actually reports a width of 1023.20 pixels. \r\n\r\nNow this means that neither queries with `max-width: 1023px;` nor queries with `min-width: 1024px;` will take effect.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Set display resolution to 2560 x 1440\r\n2. Set display scale to 125%\r\n3. Snap a browser window to either half of the screen\r\n4.

This is because the media query applies `display: block;` to items with `.navbar-menu.is-active`; however, none of the queries match due to partial pixels.\r\n\r\nI am sure there are plenty more small issues that would occur due to this.\r\n\r\n### Possible fix\r\n\r\nI took some time and found that in **mixins.sass** I can replace lines such as `@media screen and (max-width: $device - 1px)` with `@media screen and (max-width: $device - 0.001px)`. The sass compiler does not seem to have any issue handling partial pixel values and browsers are ok with them as well.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3572","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Media Query can fail on scaled displays\" (#3572)"},{"Id":"1368441971","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-10T05:10:34","Actor":"CorporateActionFigure","Number":"3571","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bulma Docs: Layout sub-items behave differently","State":"closed","Body":"Different sub-menu items under the **Layout** menu item on the left-hand side exhibit different behavior.

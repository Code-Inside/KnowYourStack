Then I figured that they are actually hardcoded within the scope of this repository, rather than applied by tooling (e.g. `autoprefixer`).\r\n\r\n*Edit:* for the `::placeholder` mixin, it was actually rendering all the variants *except* for the correct modern `::placeholder` pseudo-element, so this actually might ensure proper behavior across environments that previously did not work.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the hardcoded vendor-prefixed variants of some properties. The preferred way (I think) should be using tooling to handle this. Although the `README` mentions that `autoprefixer` is used within this repository, it seems it has since been replaced with `cssnano`, which may not include it by default.\r\n\r\nProbably this requires rebuilding `css` too, however the `npm run build` alias mentioned in `CONTRIBUTING.md` no longer exists, so I'm not sure which parts are intended to run on MR submissions.\r\n\r\nNote: I encountered this issue on version `v0.9.4`, but I'm not sure if bugfixes are still welcome for the old version?\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nTheoretically this could cause a change of behavior on legacy browsers. Given the wide availability of the non-prefixed alternatives and the fact that tooling like `autoprefixer` is commonly used, I suspect this will have little to no impact in that regard.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n<!-- BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR PR, MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS: -->\r\n<!-- 1.

I'm aware of having the option to load fewer modules, but even with fewer modules it still seems very slow.

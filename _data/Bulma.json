I don't see a reason not to keep sizes uniform across everything, with certain contexts using different sizes in different places. I am aware that `$size-x` variables are mentioned as typography.\r\n\r\nThis is probably a breaking change, in which case `$root-size-x` or something could be added which both `$size-x` and `$spacing-values` would reference.\r\n```\r\n$root-size-x\r\n|\r\n+-- $size-x\r\n|   |\r\n|   +-- $sizes\r\n|\r\n+-- $spacing-x\r\n    |\r\n    +-- $spacing-values\r\n```\r\nOne can then either customise both size types at once, using `$root-size-4: 1.6rem`, or either typography and spacing sizes separately. In either case, adding additional `$spacing-x` variables to customise specific spacing values makes sense to me.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n1. First Step\r\n2. Second Step\r\n3. and so on...\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. Customise `$size-4`\r\n2.

Set `$control-border-width` to be `2px`\r\n2. Have two or more buttons in a field with `has-addons`, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"field has-addons\">\r\n\t<p class=\"control\">\r\n\t\t<button class=\"button\">Previous</button>\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p class=\"control\">\r\n\t\t<button class=\"button\">Next</button>\r\n\t</p>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe apparent shared border between the buttons should appear to be `2px`, in accordance with the `$control-border-width` value\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe apparent shared border between the buttons will appear to be `3px`\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3713","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Field with addons does not display custom border width properly\" (#3713)"},{"Id":"2101844588","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-26T09:05:46","Actor":"1GR3","Number":"3712","RawContent":null,"Title":"The more specific padding/margin classes do not override less specific padding/margin classes","State":"open","Body":"\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\n\r\nI'm using Bulma **version** [0.9.4] \r\nMy **browser** is: Brave\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe more specific padding/margin classes do not override less specific padding/margin classes as expected.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nAdd .p-4 and .pt-0 classes to a div\r\n<div class=\"p-4 pt-0\">\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe div will get padding 1rem all around but the top padding will be reset to zero like if we wrote this is css:\r\npadding: 1rem;\r\npadding-top: 0;\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe div will have all paddings the same size: 1rem.\r\nmore specific class .pt-0 wont override the properties of the less specific class .p-4 as expected from css rules, or frameworks such as Bootstrap or TailwindCSS.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3712","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"The more specific padding/margin classes do not override less specific padding/margin classes\" (#3712)"},{"Id":"2092188693","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-20T18:13:26","Actor":"Zubrik","Number":"3711","RawContent":null,"Title":"Feature request: add Utopia library to Bulma for responsive fluid design","State":"open","Body":"This is about **Bulma**.\r\n\r\nIt is a feature request.\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to add [Utopia library](https://utopia.fyi/) to Bulma framework, so as to take advantage of fluid responsive typography and spacing.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nIt could be something like this:\r\n\r\n1. Define type scale in Utopia\r\n2. Import type scale variables to Bulma\r\n3. Change `$size-1, $size-2, $size-3`… variables to use Utopia type scale variables: `$size-1: var(--step-7); $size-2: var(--step-6);`…\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3711","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feature request: add Utopia library to Bulma for responsive fluid design\" (#3711)"},{"Id":"2092169583","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-20T17:27:14","Actor":"Supermarcel10","Number":"3710","RawContent":null,"Title":"[FEATURE RQ] Buttons element should have button specifics","State":"open","Body":"## This is a feature request for **Bulma CSS Framework**.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAdd helper methods to `buttons` element, such like `are-rouded`, `are-primary` where the default for all buttons contained is to be for e.g. round or primary color.\r\n\r\nThis reduces repetition and readability, especially if there are many buttons. This is how it'd look in code:\r\n```\r\n<button class=\"button is-primary is-rounded\">Hello</button>\r\n<button class=\"button is-primary is-rounded\">World!</button>\r\n<button class=\"button is-primary is-rounded\">I</button>\r\n<button class=\"button is-link is-rounded\">Am</button>\r\n<button class=\"button is-link\">A</button>\r\n<button class=\"button is-primary\">Programmer</button>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n<span class=\"buttons are-primary are-rounded\">\r\n  <button class=\"button\">Hello</button>\r\n  <button class=\"button\">World!</button>\r\n  <button class=\"button\">I</button>\r\n  <button class=\"button\">Am</button>\r\n  <button class=\"button is-link is-squared\">A</button>\r\n  <button class=\"button is-squared\">Programmer</button>\r\n</span>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How to Implement\r\n\r\nTo implement it's fairly simple but tedious. The simplest method would be to add it to all button color states and the `is-rounded`. This way all nested buttons that use a different color can still override the default `buttons` color, just like with size. For e.g.\r\n```\r\n.button.is-rounded, .buttons.are-rounded .button {\r\n  border-radius: 9999px;\r\n  padding-left: calc(1em + 0.25em);\r\n  padding-right: calc(1em + 0.25em);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.button.is-primary, .buttons.are-primary .button {\r\n  background-color: hsl(171, 100%, 41%);\r\n  border-color: transparent;\r\n  color: #fff;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note: Some clarification may have to be made with how `is-toggle-rounded` would work in this example, or alternatively it can be dropped and replaced with `is-squared` or similar. This is to allow removing the roundness of a `button` in a `buttons` nest.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3710","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[FEATURE RQ] Buttons element should have button specifics\" (#3710)"},{"Id":"1958036056","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-19T13:39:21","Actor":"rgalea","Number":"3692","RawContent":null,"Title":"Problem with example JavaScript for Modal","State":"closed","Body":"This is about the Bulma **Docs** \r\n\r\nThe example JavaScript on https://bulma.io/documentation/components/modal/ has the following block:\r\n<pre>// Add a keyboard event to close all modals\r\ndocument.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {\r\n  if (event.code === 'Escape') {\r\n    closeAllModals();\r\n  }\r\n});</pre>\r\n\r\nThis does not work on Chrome (118.0.5993.88) on a Mac (13.5.2)\r\n\r\nI replaced it with:\r\n<pre>// Add a keyboard event to close all modals\r\ndocument.addEventListener(\"keydown\",function(e){\r\n  if(e.key === \"Escape\") {\r\n    closeAllModals();\r\n  }\r\n});</pre>\r\n\r\nI have tested this solution on Chrome and Firefox on a Mac and on Edge on Windows.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3692","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Problem with example JavaScript for Modal\" (#3692)"},{"Id":"2074355080","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-10T13:15:05","Actor":"EvgenyKhlivetsky","Number":"3709","RawContent":null,"Title":"Feat/colors fonts update","State":"closed","Body":"Update accent color to be green, change fonts, change scheme color","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/3709","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Feat/colors fonts update\" (#3709)"},{"Id":"2057866736","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-12-28T00:29:45","Actor":"jorvis","Number":"3707","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add documentation for which elements can't be within a dropdown-item element.

Import the initial variables\r\n@import \"../../node_modules/bulma/sass/utilities/initial-variables.sass\";\r\n@import \"../../node_modules/bulma/sass/utilities/functions.sass\";\r\n\r\n// 2.

Set the derived variables\r\n$background: var(--fs-background);\r\n\r\n@import \"../../node_modules/bulma/bulma.sass\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also used the steps above to set other variables which worked fine: (other css variables omitted for shorter code)\r\n\r\n```css\r\n$scheme-main: var(--scheme-main);\r\n$scheme-invert: var(--scheme-invert);\r\n$text: var(--text);\r\n$text-light: var(--text-light);\r\n$text-strong: var(--text-strong);\r\n$content-blockquote-background-color: var(--fs-background);\r\n$modal-background-background-color: var(--background);\r\n$tabs-boxed-link-hover-background-color: var(--fs-background);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect `$background` to be replaced just like the others\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nI get a compilation error:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/assets/39732517/49512022-d7da-4790-b14e-e89f7203e6ee)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3694","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"$background varable cannot be set with css variable\" (#3694)"},{"Id":"1959884145","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-24T18:57:26","Actor":"daveHylde","Number":"3693","RawContent":null,"Title":"Feature/flex is-gap with sizes derived from initial $sizes values","State":"open","Body":"This is a new feature.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nBulmas `is-flex` helpers greatly simplifies implementation of flexbox layouts, but a common request is to have gaps between the flexed items.

This design allows users to quickly associate content with the selected tab, as showcased in the demo. It provides a seamless integration between tabs and their respective content, offering both static and dynamic content display options.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Feature\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces elements for content with pages located beneath the tabs created using the `tabs` element. The new `tabs-box`, `tabs-content`, and `tabs-page` elements provide a standardized framework for adding dynamically displayed tabbed content.\r\n\r\n- These elements are optional, enabling tabs to be used without any content.\r\n- The elements can also be used to display static content by simply having a single page marked with `is-active`.\r\n- By utilizing these predefined elements:\r\n    - The script for toggling and presenting individual pages can be standardized and simplified.\r\n    - Themes can style the box where the tabbed content appears.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nThis feature introduces a few more elements and variables to the framework. Ideally, there should be a standalone solution for paged content where only one page is visible at a time. Such a concept could then be applied to future design elements, like collapsible sections and similar UI concepts.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\n- I tested the tabs box with various styles using the default colors and encountered no issues.\r\n- I've set up a demo page: https://erbsland-dev.github.io/bulma-tab-box-demo/\r\n\r\n### Changelog Updated?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/3689","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"New Feature: Tabs with Content Box and Pages.\" (#3689)"},{"Id":"1931777374","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-08T11:56:39","Actor":"tonprince","Number":"3688","RawContent":null,"Title":"Nested messages will use color from top message","State":"open","Body":"When nesting messages in Bulma, the color of the inner message is overwritten by the outer message.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nColor of the inner message should be used.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3688","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Nested messages will use color from top message\" (#3688)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2024-02-23T03:30:08.8926878Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":369}

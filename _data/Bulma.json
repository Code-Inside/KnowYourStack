This ensures harmonious visuals and of course it is an application of the nature rules.\n\n### Hypothesis\nFocusing on Data Visualization is an excellent choice for a practical application of the Golden Ratio's principles of harmony and balance.\n\nIn data visualization, the Golden Ratio `(φ ~=1.618)` is not about calculating performance, but about guiding the aesthetic and structural design to create visuals that are:\n\n**Visually Appealing**: Easier and more pleasant for the human eye to perceive.\n**Hierarchical**: Clearly guiding the viewer's attention to the most important information.\n**Balanced**: Creating a sense of order and professionalism.\n\n#### How the Golden Ratio is applied in Data Visualization:\n##### Layout and Composition:\n\n**Dividing Space**: A common application is to divide a dashboard or a chart area into two main sections (e.g., a dominant content area and a subordinate sidebar or detail panel) such that their widths or heights are in a Golden Ratio proportion (approximately 61.8% to 38.2%). This creates a natural visual hierarchy and guides the eye.\n\n**Content Placement**: Important elements can be placed at the intersections of a \"Golden Section Grid,\" similar to the rule of thirds but with Golden Ratio proportions.\nTypography:\n\n**Font Sizing**: Establishing a harmonious typographic scale. For example, if your base body text font size is `X`, then a subheading could be `X * φ`, and a main heading could be `X * φ^2`. This creates a proportional relationship between text elements, improving readability and visual flow.\nElement Sizing and Spacing:\n\n**Chart Elements**: While less common for raw data points, the proportions of legends, axis labels, or even the overall dimensions of charts within a dashboard can be designed using the Golden Ratio.\n\n**White Space (Padding/Margins)**: Using proportions based on `φ` for the empty space around and between elements can contribute to visual cleanliness and reduce clutter.\n\n### Proposed solution\nThis is a prototype to visualize the application of Golden Ratio in design:\n\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-qrvhou5t?file=index.html\n\n#### How to Observe the Golden Ratio in the Prototype:\n**Layout Proportions**: The main content area will occupy approximately 61.8% of the dashboard's width, while the sidebar takes up the remaining 38.2%. This creates a visually dominant area and a supporting area in Golden Ratio proportion. Resize your browser window to see how they maintain their proportions.\n\n**Font Scaling**: The Dashboard Main View (H1) is significantly larger than the subheadings and body text, scaled by `φ^2`.\nSubheadings like Key Performance Indicators Overview (and main sidebar headings) are scaled by `φ` relative to the base paragraph text.\nSmaller text (like filter or detail descriptions) might be scaled down by `φ`.\n\nThis prototype provides a visual demonstration of how the Golden Ratio can be applied to structure and present information in data visualizations, aiming for a more balanced, harmonious, and aesthetically pleasing user experience.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3989","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Apply Golden Ratio Principle (Phi ~= 1.618) in Bulma\" (#3989)"},{"Id":"3089183009","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-25T09:53:44","Actor":"Vollbrecht","Number":"3988","RawContent":null,"Title":"Theme customizer lag the ability to change text primary color","State":"open","Body":"I am talking about the \"customizer\" on the docs page.

A very common example would be a `dropdown` for each element of the `menu-list`, with the current styling the dropdown styles are completely broken if I use `a` or `button` inside it, and it is not trivial to fix this with custom CSS, since the styles for these tags are reset and overridden with a high specificity.\n\nI think the better approach would be what Bulma is already doing for almost every other element/component: let the designer decide if they want the styles or not with a class (in this case there is already the `menu-item` class that applies exactly the same styles that are applied by default to `a` and `button`).\n\nFor now I am forced to vendor my own version of Bulma just to remove all `.menu-list a,.menu-list button` selectors, leaving only `.menu-list .menu-item`.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3971","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`menu-list` class should not influence `a` and `button` tags\" (#3971)"},{"Id":"2871112815","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-22T18:02:08","Actor":"Athozus","Number":"3969","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Feature Request] Dark tags","State":"open","Body":"Hi,\n\nFirstly thanks for this wonderful framework.\n\nCurrently we have design for dark buttons (there are really adapted to the dark themes gg).

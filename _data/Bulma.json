The real padding is written using `+ltr` / `+rtl` mixins, and using the specific values `$notification-padding-ltr` and `$notification-padding-rtl`. \r\n\r\nThis obscures what we really want to do: __Offer a configurable value for padding, and set an appropriate default based on the value of `$rtl`.__\r\n\r\nTo correct this, we create a 4th variable, `$default-notification-padding`, which is populated by `@if $rtl`, then set the default (replaceable) value of `$notification-padding` with this new variable.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\n- Add a new variable that isn't necessarily worth documenting, and makes this definition more verbose\r\n- Add an insignificant amount of compute time during render\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\n<!-- BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR PR, MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS: -->\r\n- [x] Pull the latest `master` branch\r\n- [x] Make sure your Sass code is compliant with the [Bulma Sass styleguide](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#bulma-sass-styleguide)\r\n- [x] Make sure your PR only affects `.sass` or documentation files\r\n- [x] [Try your changes](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#try-your-changes).\r\n\r\nThe following code blocks are pairs of (test case `bulma.sass`, and the output of `grep -A4 \"\\.notification {\" css/bulma.css` after running `npm run build`):\r\n\r\n```bulma.sass\r\n@charset \"utf-8\"\r\n/*! bulma.io v0.9.4 | MIT License | github.com/jgthms/bulma */\r\n@import \"sass/utilities/_all\"\r\n@import \"sass/elements/notification.sass\"\r\n```\r\n```css/bulma.css\r\n.notification {\r\n  background-color: whitesmoke;\r\n  border-radius: 4px;\r\n  position: relative;\r\n  padding: 1.25rem 2.5rem 1.25rem 1.5rem;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we see the default still stays ready for ltr with a delete button on the right.\r\n\r\n```bulma.sass\r\n@charset \"utf-8\"\r\n/*! bulma.io v0.9.4 | MIT License | github.com/jgthms/bulma */\r\n@import \"sass/utilities/_all\"\r\n$rtl: true\r\n@import \"sass/elements/notification.sass\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```css/bulma.css\r\n.notification {\r\n  background-color: whitesmoke;\r\n  border-radius: 4px;\r\n  position: relative;\r\n  padding: 1.25rem 1.5rem 1.25rem 2.5rem;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen `$rtl` is enabled, the padding is now updated without any other changes.\r\n\r\n```bulma.sass\r\n@charset \"utf-8\"\r\n/*! bulma.io v0.9.4 | MIT License | github.com/jgthms/bulma */\r\n@import \"sass/utilities/_all\"\r\n$rtl: true\r\n$notification-padding: 0px\r\n@import \"sass/elements/notification.sass\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```css/bulma.css\r\n.notification {\r\n  background-color: whitesmoke;\r\n  border-radius: 4px;\r\n  position: relative;\r\n  padding: 0px;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow even with `$rtl` enabled, the output is still the specified value of `$notification-padding`.\r\n\r\n### Changelog updated?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks! -->\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/3544","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix usage of ltr/rtl padding for notifications (Fixes #3025)\" (#3544)"},{"Id":"1268648929","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-12T17:24:41","Actor":"SomeMinecraftModder","Number":"3543","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add new typography helper","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n<!-- DO NOT REBUILD THE CSS OUTPUT IN YOUR PR -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is a **new feature**.\r\n<!-- New feature?

Bring up a page containing an instance of the  `select` class which has `<options>`. (For example, https://bulma.io/documentation/form/select/.)\r\n2. Using the browser developer tools, edit one of the `<option>` tags to contain a `selected` attribute, e.g. `<option selected=\"selected\">`.\r\n3. It may be necessary to repeat this a few times, moving the `selected` attribute to different options, before the bug is reproduced.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe option selected in the dropdown display changes to match the `<option>` with the `selected` attribute. (This is the behaviour when the same steps are performed on e.g. https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_select).\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nInitially, the actual behaviour may appear to match the expected behaviour. However, after a few repeats of the above steps, the displayed option selection no longer changes when the `selected` attribute is moved. As a result, the underlying value of the dropdown may become different from the value the user thinks it has.

I noticed that the modifier \"is-narrow\" is not being applied to the whole table, So it ends up being fullwidth, regardless of setting the whole table to be \"is-narrow\".\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nSince I'm using Jekyll, I added the table class for the whole table using\r\n\r\n```\r\n| Col1  | Col2  | Col3  | Col4  | Col5  |\r\n|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\r\n| blah  | blah  | blah  | blah  | blah  |\r\n| blah  | blah  | blah  | blah  | blah  |\r\n| blah  | blah  | blah  | blah  | blah  |\r\n| blah  | blah  | blah  | blah  | blah  |\r\n{: class=\"table is-bordered is-narrow is-striped\"}\r\n```  \r\n\r\nbut the table was still in full width.\r\n\r\nThis theme has an `/assets/css/app.scss` file that can be used for customization. So I added:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n.table {\r\n  &.is-narrow {\r\n    white-space: nowrap;\r\n    width: 1%;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis worked and my tables are now using only the proper space.\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3695","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Table is-narrow not working when applied to the whole table (as in class=\"table is-narrow\")\" (#3695)"},{"Id":"1975715120","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-11-03T08:57:51","Actor":"Freymaurer","Number":"3694","RawContent":null,"Title":"$background varable cannot be set with css variable","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma**.\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\nI'm using Bulma **version** [0.9.4]\r\nThis is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [1.64.2]\r\nI am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**?\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Description of the bug, enhancement, or question -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI want to use css variables with Bulma to create a dark/light mode toggle on via the `data-theme` attribute. Bulma is referenced as npm package and compiled with sass and vite.\r\n\r\nI followed Bulma docs to set custom variables, the following code reduced to minimum:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n// 1. Import the initial variables\r\n@import \"../../node_modules/bulma/sass/utilities/initial-variables.sass\";\r\n@import \"../../node_modules/bulma/sass/utilities/functions.sass\";\r\n\r\n// 2.

Set the derived variables\r\n$background: var(--fs-background);\r\n\r\n@import \"../../node_modules/bulma/bulma.sass\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also used the steps above to set other variables which worked fine: (other css variables omitted for shorter code)\r\n\r\n```css\r\n$scheme-main: var(--scheme-main);\r\n$scheme-invert: var(--scheme-invert);\r\n$text: var(--text);\r\n$text-light: var(--text-light);\r\n$text-strong: var(--text-strong);\r\n$content-blockquote-background-color: var(--fs-background);\r\n$modal-background-background-color: var(--background);\r\n$tabs-boxed-link-hover-background-color: var(--fs-background);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect `$background` to be replaced just like the others\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nI get a compilation error:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/assets/39732517/49512022-d7da-4790-b14e-e89f7203e6ee)\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3694","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"$background varable cannot be set with css variable\" (#3694)"},{"Id":"1959884145","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-24T18:57:26","Actor":"daveHylde","Number":"3693","RawContent":null,"Title":"Feature/flex is-gap with sizes derived from initial $sizes values","State":"open","Body":"This is a new feature.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nBulmas `is-flex` helpers greatly simplifies implementation of flexbox layouts, but a common request is to have gaps between the flexed items.

The initial sizes are scaled down 1/3 to range between `.25rem` and `1rem` with Bulmas default sizes.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nThis does create a slightly larger css bundle - although not a lot.  \r\nIt would also be an option to add different gaps for different screen sizes, but this would create an even larger bundle size without adding a lot of value.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nLocal testing done with all sizes and settings.

This design allows users to quickly associate content with the selected tab, as showcased in the demo. It provides a seamless integration between tabs and their respective content, offering both static and dynamic content display options.\r\n\r\n### Proposed Feature\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces elements for content with pages located beneath the tabs created using the `tabs` element. The new `tabs-box`, `tabs-content`, and `tabs-page` elements provide a standardized framework for adding dynamically displayed tabbed content.\r\n\r\n- These elements are optional, enabling tabs to be used without any content.\r\n- The elements can also be used to display static content by simply having a single page marked with `is-active`.\r\n- By utilizing these predefined elements:\r\n    - The script for toggling and presenting individual pages can be standardized and simplified.\r\n    - Themes can style the box where the tabbed content appears.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nThis feature introduces a few more elements and variables to the framework. Ideally, there should be a standalone solution for paged content where only one page is visible at a time. Such a concept could then be applied to future design elements, like collapsible sections and similar UI concepts.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\n- I tested the tabs box with various styles using the default colors and encountered no issues.\r\n- I've set up a demo page: https://erbsland-dev.github.io/bulma-tab-box-demo/\r\n\r\n### Changelog Updated?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/3689","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"New Feature: Tabs with Content Box and Pages.\" (#3689)"},{"Id":"1931777374","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-08T11:56:39","Actor":"tonprince","Number":"3688","RawContent":null,"Title":"Nested messages will use color from top message","State":"open","Body":"When nesting messages in Bulma, the color of the inner message is overwritten by the outer message.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nColor of the inner message should be used.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3688","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Nested messages will use color from top message\" (#3688)"},{"Id":"1926509159","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-10-04T15:55:46","Actor":"flaubertlekhem","Number":"3687","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bulma css does not work in production","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma | the Docs**.\r\n\r\n<!-- Is it about Bulma or about the Docs? -->\r\n<!-- Is it a bug/feature/question or do you need help? -->\r\nIf it's a bug, is it a browser bug?\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **CSS framework** -->\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **Docs** -->\r\n I'm using Bulma **version** [0.9.4] \r\n My **Microsoft Edge** is: \r\n<!-- This is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- I am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**? -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Description of the bug, enhancement, or question -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

This assigns a value to a variable only if that variable isn‚Äôt defined or its value is [null](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/null). Otherwise, the existing value will be used.\r\n\r\nThis means that both of these variables can **never be** null. If they get set to null outside, `!default` kicks in and overwrites that value.\r\nThis means not only that the null checks are useless, but also that the generation of these classes can't be turned off, which was probably intended.\r\nI found this tweet which claims that an empty list / array works instead, but it creates an error when i try to compile it because at least in the current versions of SASS, an empty list is not equal to null: https://twitter.com/TweetsOfSumit/status/1346502700893155328?s=20&t=ZSeM19qMCyagy71ppkyNpw\r\nAnd even if that was true, it's not documented anywhere.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3507","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"null checks on !default variables are useless because they can't be null\" (#3507)"},{"Id":"1194584883","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-06T13:02:30","Actor":"FunctionDJ","Number":"3506","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow customization of typography $alignments in SASS","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma**.\r\n\r\n<!-- Is it about Bulma or about the Docs? -->\r\n<!-- Is it a bug/feature/question or do you need help? -->\r\n<!-- If it's a bug, is it a browser bug? -->\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\nI'm using Bulma **version** 0.9.3\r\nThis is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [not relevant]\r\nI am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAllow customization of `sass/helpers/typography.sass` -> `$alignments`.\r\nhttps://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/e5ee280b32c2bac94e363013777ff41d1a9ed2dc/sass/helpers/typography.sass#L29\r\nI think it should be as easy as appending `!default` which worked for me but i'm not too sure if it could break something else.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3506","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow customization of typography $alignments in SASS\" (#3506)"},{"Id":"1190137875","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-01T18:25:50","Actor":"PhoenixIV","Number":"3505","RawContent":null,"Title":"How to know which files can be excluded from building?","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\n<!-- Is it about Bulma or about the Docs? -->\r\n<!-- Is it a bug/feature/question or do you need help? -->\r\n<!-- If it's a bug, is it a browser bug? -->\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\nThis is about **building Bulma**.\r\nThis is about **the Docs**.\r\nI need help and have a feature suggestion.\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **CSS framework** -->\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **Docs** -->\r\n<!-- I'm using Bulma **version** [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- My **browser** is: -->\r\n<!-- This is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- I am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**? -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nMy aim is to keep my css as slim as possible.

I don't see a reason not to keep sizes uniform across everything, with certain contexts using different sizes in different places. I am aware that `$size-x` variables are mentioned as typography.\r\n\r\nThis is probably a breaking change, in which case `$root-size-x` or something could be added which both `$size-x` and `$spacing-values` would reference.\r\n```\r\n$root-size-x\r\n|\r\n+-- $size-x\r\n|   |\r\n|   +-- $sizes\r\n|\r\n+-- $spacing-x\r\n    |\r\n    +-- $spacing-values\r\n```\r\nOne can then either customise both size types at once, using `$root-size-4: 1.6rem`, or either typography and spacing sizes separately.

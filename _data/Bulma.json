This happens when the user's chosen theme doesn't match their system settings (e.g., the user sets light mode but has dark mode enabled in the OS) and also if your custom style differs from the standard values for that specific theme.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab90550c-a91f-4182-a50a-32bd2d1a0a84\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe website should not flash from one theme to the other when the user setting does not match the system settings. \r\n\r\nI am not sure if this is a bulma specific problem but at least it also happens on the official website and maybe someone else here knows how to deal with it.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3880","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Styling issues on page load (light / dark mode) \" (#3880)"},{"Id":"2452251695","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-13T03:31:15","Actor":"resting","Number":"3878","RawContent":null,"Title":"Is there hosted documentation for older versions?","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **the Docs**.\r\n\r\nRequest for online documentation for older versions if not available.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3878","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Is there hosted documentation for older versions?\" (#3878)"},{"Id":"2459108597","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-10T14:09:26","Actor":"pedrokost","Number":"3879","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fixed grid breakpoint are relative to container instead of viewport","State":"open","Body":"This is a bug about Bulma.\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\nI'm using Bulma **version** 1.0.0\r\nMy **browser** is: Google Chrome\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe [Fixed Grid](https://bulma.io/documentation/grid/fixed-grid/) supports setting different size depending on breakpoints.\r\n\r\nThe breakpoints are called mobile, table, desktop, etc\r\n\r\nHowever, the breakpoints size actually refers to the CONTAINER size! So if you have a 2 column layout, the breakpoints will refer to the column width instead of the window width. \r\n\r\nIt is quite confusing that terms like mobile/table/desktop/etc refer to the parent container width, instead of the window width. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"container-fluid\">\r\n  <div class=\"columns is-tablet\">\r\n    <section class=\"column is-6 \">\r\n      <div class=\"fixed-grid has-3-cols-mobile has-4-cols-tablet has-5-cols-desktop has-6-cols-widescreen has-7-cols-fullhd\">\r\n        <ol class=\"grid is-gap-1\">\r\n          <li class=\"cell\">\r\n            This is my cell\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li class=\"cell\">\r\n            This is my cell\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li class=\"cell\">\r\n            This is my cell\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li class=\"cell\">\r\n            This is my cell\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li class=\"cell\">\r\n            This is my cell\r\n          </li>\r\n        </ol>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </section>\r\n    <section class=\"column is-6\">\r\n      <div class=\"fixed-grid has-3-cols-mobile has-4-cols-tablet has-5-cols-desktop has-6-cols-widescreen has-7-cols-fullhd\">\r\n        <ol class=\"grid is-gap-1\">\r\n          <li class=\"cell\">\r\n            This is my cell\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li class=\"cell\">\r\n            This is my cell\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li class=\"cell\">\r\n            This is my cell\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li class=\"cell\">\r\n            This is my cell\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li class=\"cell\">\r\n            This is my cell\r\n          </li>\r\n        </ol>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </section>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect that `has-3-cols-mobile` and `has-4-cols-tablet` are relative to the window size, not the column size.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThose classes should be relative to the window size. Alternatively, provide alternative names that don't imply window size.\r\n\r\nPlease note I am only learning Bulma.

This change ensures that font styles are managed more centrally, making future updates easier and promoting better maintainability.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nThe main tradeoff is that using CSS variables requires browser support. However, most modern browsers support CSS variables, so this is not a significant issue. This approach also increases the reliance on variables for styling, which might add a slight overhead to the CSS parsing process. Alternatives include keeping hardcoded values or using a preprocessor for variable management.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nI tested the CSS changes using a minimal HTML file that includes the updated font-family variables. The changes were verified by comparing the visual output with the previous styles. I also tested the changes in different browsers to ensure consistency. \r\n\r\n### Changelog updated?\r\n\r\nNo. The Changelog has not been updated. If you think this change should be reflected in the Changelog, please let me know.\r\n\r\n### How have you confirmed this feature works?\r\n\r\nI confirmed the feature works by creating a minimal HTML test file that applies the updated font-family variables. The visual output was checked to ensure the correct fonts were applied. Additionally, I tested the changes in multiple browsers to verify compatibility.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/3877","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"update font-family variables\" (#3877)"},{"Id":"2449592622","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-05T22:39:33","Actor":"thesn10","Number":"3876","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat: add panel is-dark, is-light, is-soft, is-bold","State":"open","Body":"This PR adds `is-dark`, `is-light`, `is-soft` and `is-bold` to the panel component.\r\nI have also updated the docs:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5116d1f3-d9d1-4a33-a6b5-ebb2d86e1240)\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nYes, using the docs site.

 $menu-item-active-background-color: transparent`?\r\nThe `:hover` and `:active` styles only override the background luminance delta.\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n    &:hover {\r\n      @include cv.register-vars(\r\n        (\r\n          \"menu-item-background-l-delta\": #{cv.getVar(\r\n              \"menu-item-hover-background-l-delta\"\r\n            )},\r\n        )\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    &:active {\r\n      @include cv.register-vars(\r\n        (\r\n          \"menu-item-background-l-delta\": #{cv.getVar(\r\n              \"menu-item-active-background-l-delta\"\r\n            )},\r\n        )\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo I need to go back to override like this?\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n\r\n@use \"bulma/sass\" with (\r\n  $family-primary: 'Roboto, sans-serif',\r\n  ...\r\n);\r\n\r\n.menu-list {\r\n  a, button, .menu-item {\r\n    &:hover { \r\n      // variant 1\r\n      background-color: transparent;

And there's a big chance to miss something.\r\nThe lower way (variant 2) is just really verbose and it doesn't look like everything's overridable.

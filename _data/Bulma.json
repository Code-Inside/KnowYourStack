I have a short menu with only 4 small entries want to have a very small breakpoint for the menu (showing the full menu on most devices, and only collapsing to the hamburger menu on very narrow screens.\r\n\r\nIn my SCSS file I have defined `$navbar-breakpoint: 320px;` before including Bulma. \r\n\r\nHere part of my scss files (I also use bulmaswatch)\r\n\r\n    /* Keep the menu visible on most but the smallest devices\r\n    * @devdoc Must be applied before the bulma.sass is used, because this is used there */\r\n    $navbar-breakpoint: 320px;\r\n\r\n    /** Using Bulma CSS with a theme for Bulma */\r\n    @import '../node_modules/bulmaswatch/slate/_variables.scss';\r\n\r\n    @import '../node_modules/bulma/bulma.sass';\r\n    @import '../node_modules/bulmaswatch/slate/_overrides.scss';\r\n\r\n    /* Replayer-specific (smaller) section margins */\r\n    @import 'replayer-section.scss';\r\n\r\n    /* Player styles (to be used for the audio player) */\r\n    @import 'replayer-player-styles.scss';\r\n\r\n    /* Menu styles */\r\n    @import 'replayer-navbar-styles.scss';\r\n\r\n   .... some more specific styles\r\n\r\nThis works nice.\r\n\r\nHowever I also wanted to use the fixed menu only on the larger screens (from desktop).  I encountered the `html.has-navbar-fixed-top-desktop` style, which seems to be undocumented. **This should be documented.**\r\n\r\n**The real problem, however, is, that the aforementioned `$navbar-breakpoint: 320px;` seems to interfere with this `html.has-navbar-fixed-top-desktop`style, setting it now also to 320px, which seems wrong.**\r\n\r\nIt's wrong because it still says \"desktop\" which is far from 320px, and it should also not define the fixed-menu width.\r\n\r\nIn my case I explicitly want to have a full menu on most devices, but only a fixed menu on desktop sizes. As this currently is, I can not control both independently.\r\n\r\nI have created custom scss code to address this, which I like to share, but I guess this should be properly addressed in the framwork itself.\r\n\r\n**Probably all there is to do is to untangle the navbar breakt point from the desktop breakpoint.**\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Description of the bug, enhancement, or question -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

If the screen width is high enough, such that the grouped field is in one row, everything is fine. However, on mobile, whenever the group is broken into two lines, the last one has zero margin to the bottom. Meaning that, if you stack grouped multilined fields together, there is no space between them on a mobile device. The issue https://github.com/buefy/buefy/issues/1313 probably has the same root cause. There is mentioned that the issue is due to the margin-bottom: 0 at the last child.\r\n\r\nSee the jsfiddle to reproduce the problem https://jsfiddle.net/dmx83v65/ If you shrink the viewer width until the multiline field breaks the line due to responsive layout, you will see that there is not space between the two grouped-multilined fields (between input with placeholder 2 and input with placeholder 3)\r\n\r\nHere is a picture of what happens:\r\n\r\n![bulma](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9616291/144458250-c340339f-007d-4837-bd91-8731cea07ff9.png)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a grouped multilined field\r\n2. Create a child field (nested)\r\n3. Make a copy of the whole nested fields and paste to the end\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe spacing is not broken in case of nested fields\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThere is no space after the multiline field\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3453","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Grouped fields have no margin in case of nested fields\" (#3453)"},{"Id":"1067091827","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-01T08:49:53","Actor":"Bald-mans","Number":"3452","RawContent":null,"Title":"I can't log in to bulmo.

For the top row, I use code like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"columns\">\r\n    <div class=\"column\">\r\n        <div class=\"block\">\r\n            <div class=\"card\">\r\n                <div class=\"card-image\">\r\n                    <figure class=\"image is-square\">\r\n                        <a href=\"<%= it.image_1_full %>\">\r\n                            <img src=\"<%= it.image_1_full %>\" alt=\"Placeholder image\">\r\n                        </a>\r\n                    </figure>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"column\">\r\n        <div class=\"block\">\r\n            <div class=\"card\">\r\n                <div class=\"card-image\">\r\n                    <figure class=\"image is-square\">\r\n                        <a href=\"<%= it.image_2_full %>\">\r\n                            <img src=\"<%= it.image_2_full %>\" alt=\"Placeholder image\">\r\n                        </a>\r\n                    </figure>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will all work fine, until I combine two images next to one big one like so:\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36443026/141297527-86b9fb3e-ed53-4c95-bcc1-d78e271f7a53.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the spacing introduced by the `block` variable will make the two right images taller in height than the left big image. No matter what ratios I am using, they never end up aligning perfectly. Even if I found a perfect ratio, is it correct that the `rem` used by `block` for spacing might screw up my layout on different devices anyway?\r\n\r\nThe code I use is the following:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"columns\">\r\n    <div class=\"column is-two-thirds\">\r\n        <div class=\"block\">\r\n            <div class=\"card\">\r\n                <div class=\"card-image\">\r\n                    <figure class=\"image is-3by2\">\r\n                        <a href=\"<%= it.image_1_full %>\">\r\n                            <img src=\"<%= it.image_1_full %>\" alt=\"Placeholder image\">\r\n                        </a>\r\n                    </figure>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"column\">\r\n        <div class=\"block\">\r\n            <div class=\"card\">\r\n                <div class=\"card-image\">\r\n                    <figure class=\"image is-3by2\">\r\n                        <a href=\"<%= it.image_2_full %>\">\r\n                            <img src=\"<%= it.image_2_thumb %>\" alt=\"Placeholder image\">\r\n                        </a>\r\n                    </figure>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <div class=\"card\">\r\n            <div class=\"card-image\">\r\n                <figure class=\"image is-3by2\">\r\n                    <a href=\"<%= it.image_3_full %>\">\r\n                        <img src=\"<%= it.image_3_thumb %>\" alt=\"Placeholder image\">\r\n                    </a>\r\n                </figure>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy questions: \r\n1. Is this problem solvable, when using `block` with `rem` as spacing?\r\n2. How can I create custom ratios to perfectly compensate for the spacing in between and is there a way to calculate these ratios?\r\n3.

Is there a way to do this natively within Bulma? I try to avoid custom CSS whenever possible. Here is the fixed position button, which always remains at the bottom right of the page:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37300313/140992320-5784efce-ba55-4471-add9-9f1f52400cea.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the HTML I used to accomplish it:\r\n\r\n`<a href=\"#top\" class=\"button is-primary\" style=\"position: fixed; bottom: 10%; left: 96%\">\r\n        <i class=\"fas fa-chevron-up\"></i>\r\n    </a>`\r\n\r\nDue to the way my pages in this app can have wildly diffrent page lengths, I needed this button to always remain in the same spot and to float above all other elements. After a few interations the above CSS accomplished what I needed. I searched for a way to do this with Bulma and could not find one.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3443","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Bulma Fixed Position Elements\" (#3443)"},{"Id":"1048759093","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-09T15:44:46","Actor":"zemian","Number":"3442","RawContent":null,"Title":"title/subtitle rendered in single line in Hero container","State":"open","Body":"Hi, \r\n\r\nI noticed that the both \"hero is-halfheight\" and \"hero is-fullheight\" will make title/subtitle inside \"hero-body\" rendered in a single line instead of two.

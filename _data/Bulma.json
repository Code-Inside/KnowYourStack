I wanted to be able to make the hover and active colors of Bulma buttons a darker shade. I found that this is done with a 2.5% and 5% static value, so I made them configurable variables like almost everything else in Bulma. I did a search through the code and found a few more of these static percentages, along with a few 10% values, so I created initial variables to cover all of these values.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nSolution is to create and use variables to make the darken and lighten amounts used in Bulma configurable.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nI really can't think of any tradeoffs here. The only other alternative is to overwrite some SASS in the project that is using Bulma, but I feel like this is supposed to be in the Bulma code base.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nI started from the main (master) branch, ran `npm install` and `npm run build` to make sure it builds normally. I also tested the values in my project to make sure they worked as initial values and when configured to a different value.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changelog updated?\r\n\r\nNo - I was not sure how to add content to changelog without it being in a new version section. But it would be like this:\r\n\r\n### New features\r\n\r\n* New variables `$darken-half`, `$darken-full`, `$darken-double`, `$lighten-full`, `$lighten-double`, `$button-darken-half`, `$button-darken-full`\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/3118","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"add variables to configure the darken and lighten amounts\" (#3118)"},{"Id":"705227192","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-09-21T01:14:53","Actor":"jeferson-sb","Number":"3117","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix #3098 dropdown item color on hero sections","State":"open","Body":"\r\n<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n<!-- DO NOT REBUILD THE CSS OUTPUT IN YOUR PR -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is a **bugfix**.\r\n<!-- New feature?

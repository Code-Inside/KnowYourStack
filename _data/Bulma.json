I can't express how much of a nightmare it is to browse those docs. It's incredibly difficult to find what I need, and even when I know where it is, I still have to click through several things to get there. If it was all on a single page, I could ctrl-f to anything I needed instantly.\r\n\r\nThis would also be really beneficial for onboarding new developers, as they would be able to scroll through and see everything that bulma has to offer. I didn't know certain things were possible, until I stumbled upon them by chance in the docs while looking for something else. This is made worse by the fact that the sections/subsections are organised in a way that isn't very intuitive to me. I would much rather be able to just search something like \"center\" and see if there are classes related to centering, etc.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2936","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Please consider having all the docs on a single page\" (#2936)"},{"Id":"613821760","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-07T06:58:40","Actor":"locness3","Number":"2935","RawContent":null,"Title":"Composer package","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma**.\r\nThis is an feature request.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWould be great, if someone's available to, to create a composer package for use in PHP apps.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2935","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Composer package\" (#2935)"},{"Id":"613328490","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-06T13:39:49","Actor":"peterfealey","Number":"2934","RawContent":null,"Title":"Feature Request 'is-bold' for any element","State":"open","Body":"This is about Bulma, and is a Feature request.\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI would love the `is-primary` `is-bold` hero modifiers that create a nice gradient background, and automatically styles text to the appropriate colour, to work on any element.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2934","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Feature Request 'is-bold' for any element\" (#2934)"},{"Id":"611226173","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-03T18:41:04","Actor":"raphaellueckl","Number":"2932","RawContent":null,"Title":"Publish to unpkg","State":"closed","Body":"https://unpkg.com/browse/bulma@0.8.2\r\n\r\nDoes not exist.

I think this is something that is being done more and more so I'm assuming this will be more and more of a problem so I think it would be best to omit the background-color on the HTML tag.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you want me to do further investigation or even make a PR for this.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking into this.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2919","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Dark theme issues because bulma sets background-color on HTML element\" (#2919)"},{"Id":"602496909","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-18T16:22:03","Actor":"mostafahussein","Number":"2917","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add border-radius settings to panel-block.hover","State":"open","Body":"This PR fixes border-radius settings when moving the mouse over a panel block","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/2917","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add border-radius settings to panel-block.hover\" (#2917)"},{"Id":"602286816","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-17T23:32:33","Actor":"justin13888","Number":"2916","RawContent":null,"Title":"Hero \"is-fullheight\" class has no responsive variant","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma**.\r\n\r\n<!-- Is it about Bulma or about the Docs? -->\r\n<!-- Is it a bug/feature/question or do you need help? -->\r\n<!-- If it's a bug, is it a browser bug? -->\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **Docs** -->\r\nI'm using Bulma **version** [0.8.1]\r\nMy **browser** is: Chrome\r\n<!-- This is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [x.x.x] -->\r\nI am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**?\r\nThis is a simple feature request.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI want the class \".hero.is-fullheight\" to have variants such as \"is-fullheight-mobile\", \"is-fullheight-tablet\" which would only apply the CSS style when in mobile, tablet, etc.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nMake a section with class hero but you want it to only be the full view height when in tablet.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThere are classes for \"is-fullheight-mobile\", \"is-fullheight-tablet\", etc. where the hero has `height: 100vh`  when the browser is in the respective size.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nNot implemented.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2916","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Hero \"is-fullheight\" class has no responsive variant\" (#2916)"},{"Id":"602218242","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-04-17T20:33:46","Actor":"jwilson64","Number":"2915","RawContent":null,"Title":"Poor accessibility within the framework","State":"open","Body":"This is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\n\r\nI'm using Bulma 0.8\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Description of the bug, enhancement, or question -->\r\n\r\nA major problem within the framework itself is that there are poor uses of HTML for things like accessibility.

For the top row, I use code like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"columns\">\r\n    <div class=\"column\">\r\n        <div class=\"block\">\r\n            <div class=\"card\">\r\n                <div class=\"card-image\">\r\n                    <figure class=\"image is-square\">\r\n                        <a href=\"<%= it.image_1_full %>\">\r\n                            <img src=\"<%= it.image_1_full %>\" alt=\"Placeholder image\">\r\n                        </a>\r\n                    </figure>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"column\">\r\n        <div class=\"block\">\r\n            <div class=\"card\">\r\n                <div class=\"card-image\">\r\n                    <figure class=\"image is-square\">\r\n                        <a href=\"<%= it.image_2_full %>\">\r\n                            <img src=\"<%= it.image_2_full %>\" alt=\"Placeholder image\">\r\n                        </a>\r\n                    </figure>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will all work fine, until I combine two images next to one big one like so:\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36443026/141297527-86b9fb3e-ed53-4c95-bcc1-d78e271f7a53.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the spacing introduced by the `block` variable will make the two right images taller in height than the left big image. No matter what ratios I am using, they never end up aligning perfectly. Even if I found a perfect ratio, is it correct that the `rem` used by `block` for spacing might screw up my layout on different devices anyway?\r\n\r\nThe code I use is the following:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"columns\">\r\n    <div class=\"column is-two-thirds\">\r\n        <div class=\"block\">\r\n            <div class=\"card\">\r\n                <div class=\"card-image\">\r\n                    <figure class=\"image is-3by2\">\r\n                        <a href=\"<%= it.image_1_full %>\">\r\n                            <img src=\"<%= it.image_1_full %>\" alt=\"Placeholder image\">\r\n                        </a>\r\n                    </figure>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"column\">\r\n        <div class=\"block\">\r\n            <div class=\"card\">\r\n                <div class=\"card-image\">\r\n                    <figure class=\"image is-3by2\">\r\n                        <a href=\"<%= it.image_2_full %>\">\r\n                            <img src=\"<%= it.image_2_thumb %>\" alt=\"Placeholder image\">\r\n                        </a>\r\n                    </figure>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <div class=\"card\">\r\n            <div class=\"card-image\">\r\n                <figure class=\"image is-3by2\">\r\n                    <a href=\"<%= it.image_3_full %>\">\r\n                        <img src=\"<%= it.image_3_thumb %>\" alt=\"Placeholder image\">\r\n                    </a>\r\n                </figure>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy questions: \r\n1. Is this problem solvable, when using `block` with `rem` as spacing?\r\n2. How can I create custom ratios to perfectly compensate for the spacing in between and is there a way to calculate these ratios?\r\n3. What would the smart approach be?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nFind image ratios with normal `block` spacing, which do not create offsets like in the images above\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe `block` spacing introduces an offset, which looks bad\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3444","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Tough question regarding image ratios and blocks for spacing\" (#3444)"},{"Id":"1049024507","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-10T08:04:29","Actor":"jcantrel","Number":"3443","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bulma Fixed Position Elements","State":"closed","Body":"This is about Bulma.\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework** \r\nI'm using Bulma **version** [0.9.2] \r\nMy **browser** is: Chrome\r\nI am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have created a fixed position button for moving to the top, using manual CSS.

It would be way more useful if there were multiple CSS files, meaning there is one file for each component,  element, or concept just like the [SASS files](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/tree/master/sass). If this was also a thing for CSS we could just import **only** the CDN files we need instead of one big CSS file. When I use my Bulma CSS on [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), I am told that there is lots of unused CSS. This makes the website way slower. The best solution would be those multiple CSS files. I know this is already a thing for SASS, but it is complicated to set up, especially for static site generators. I would strongly appreciate it if someone made this change possible. Please let me know what you think of this suggestion, and how likely it is to be implemented.

Copy and pasted the **Dropdown** component\r\nHere's the codes I used: \r\n```HTML\r\n<div class=\"dropdown is-active\">\r\n  <div class=\"dropdown-trigger\">\r\n    <button class=\"button\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" aria-controls=\"dropdown-menu5\">\r\n      <span>right aligned</span>\r\n      <span class=\"icon is-small\">\r\n        <i class=\"fas fa-angle-down\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>\r\n      </span>\r\n    </button>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"dropdown-menu\" id=\"dropdown-menu5\" role=\"menu\">\r\n    <div class=\"dropdown-content\">\r\n      <div class=\"dropdown-item\">\r\n        <p>The dropdown is <strong>left-aligned</strong> by default.</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n2. Here's a screenshot of results\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53313989/134768426-575d31da-b70c-401c-b938-4aaf127df056.png)\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nHere's a screenshot of expected behaviour:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53313989/134768563-b684afb9-817e-4778-8313-d891918f5144.png)\r\nThe **Dropdown** should not be **RTL** in a **RTL** compiled sass/css because what's the point of being left aligned by default when it's not in a RTL environment\r\nMy solution is to make it **Left aligned** in RTL by default and if the user wanted to make it **Right aligned**, he has to use the `.is-right` class.\r\n\r\nThank you.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3419","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Problem with `Dropdown` component in RTL\" (#3419)"},{"Id":"1006440968","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-09-24T12:59:47","Actor":"AndrewLemons","Number":"3418","RawContent":null,"Title":"Improve catagories menu scrolling","State":"open","Body":"Scrolling through the categories menu, especially on long documentation pages, is very difficult. Allowing overflowing content to scroll will allow users to browser the menu without the need to scroll down to the bottom of the page (or top) to see all items.\r\n\r\nThis is a **improvement**.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n- Set the categories menu overflow to scrolling.\r\n- Set the height of the categories menu to 100vh to ensure it scrolls correctly (and so everything can be seen).\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nThere shouldn't be many major tradeoffs.

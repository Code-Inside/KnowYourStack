But I am new to SASS and still a Bulma beginner, so maybe there is a more practical approach?\r\n\r\nIdeally a user would just use a dropdown menu for selecting his/her language and JavaScript and Bulma are doing their magic behind the scenes.

There is no container larger than `is-large` (3rem) that can contains at maximum `fa-2x` (2rem), putting a `fa-5x` or `fa-10x` inside will display a 5rem or 10rem icon but it will have weird behavior and will override other element and have a wrong spacing.\r\n\r\nBut this is just worth when you are trying to play with [stacked icons](https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/icon/#font-awesome-variations), after `fa-2ex` nothing is centered properly (FA alerts that additional CSS should be required ref.

In the documentation, gaps can be set on mobile display sizes using a `-mobile` helper: `columns is-variable is-1-mobile`. However on mobile, columns are stacked by default. So in the [example in the documentation](https://bulma.io/documentation/columns/gap/#breakpoint-based-column-gaps), `is-1-mobile` does nothing to change the layout. To reproduce, change that class to `is-3-mobile` and see how it has no effect on the layout. \r\n\r\nMy intent is that on mobile there is a vertical gap between each column but it seems like Bulma does not offer such functionality. At all sizes, the `--columnGap` is set on the left and right padding but not top and bottom. \r\n```\r\npadding-left: var(--columnGap);\r\npadding-right: var(--columnGap);\r\n```\r\n\r\nEither the documentation should clarify that `is-n-mobile` does nothing without `is-mobile`, or such functionality to adjust vertical gap at mobile viewport should be introduced. \r\n\r\nI can file a PR if such a feature makes sense.

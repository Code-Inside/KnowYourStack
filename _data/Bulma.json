However after 0.7.5 and #2297, a column with a size modifier no longer has a predictable width.\r\n\r\nIf the login form has some text blurb which is \"long\", the form behaves as expected.\r\n\r\nBut if the login form doesn't have any wide child elements, the form shrinks to the width of the input fields which is far less than half the width of the container.  It looks weird.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be because the desktop container used to have a fixed width of 960px but now its width is auto.  \r\n\r\nIn the screenshots the container has a blue outline; and the `.columns` div has a green outline; and the `.column` has an orange outline.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe container should be the width of the screen.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe container shrinks its width, causing my `.is-half` column, when not containing any long text, to shrink to half the width the container chose.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1259\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-05-15 at 3 29 44 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7265/82061688-efd7b580-96c0-11ea-84af-3261beea5136.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1261\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-05-15 at 3 29 30 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7265/82061692-f108e280-96c0-11ea-9a66-19d3fd90beb0.png\">\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2950","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Removing .container fixed width values makes column size depend on content\" (#2950)"},{"Id":"618581710","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-14T22:50:59","Actor":"trymeouteh","Number":"2949","RawContent":null,"Title":"move away from jQuery?","State":"open","Body":"Will Bulma move away from jQuery?

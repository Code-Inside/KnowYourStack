I have customized Bulma quite a lot and have plenty of custom colors, variables and so on so I know my SASS file is working fine, but since upgrading to 0.9.0 I am unable to update the notification padding without also updating the variables for `ltr` and `rtl`. Should the ltr & rtl variables be derived perhaps? \r\n<!-- Description of the bug, enhancement, or question -->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Create a sass file per the docs in order to customize Bulma\r\n2. Override the `$notification-padding` variable, a la `$notification-padding: 0.375rem 0.75rem;`\r\n3. Import Bulma as normal: `@import \"~bulma/bulma\";`\r\n<!--\r\n1. First Step\r\n2. Second Step\r\n3. and so on...\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNotification padding should be set to `0.375rem 0.75rem`\r\n<!-- What you expected to happen -->\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nNotification padding remains at the default value in `~bulma/bulma/sass/elements/notification.sass`: `$notification-padding: 1.25rem 2.5rem 1.25rem 1.5rem !default`\r\n\r\nThis can be overcome by also overriding the other padding variables in this file, but this is not immediately clear to people who had adjusted it prior to the addition of the `ltr` and `rtl` variables:\r\n```\r\n$notification-padding: 0.375rem 0.75rem;\r\n$notification-padding-ltr: 0.375rem 0.75rem;\r\n$notification-padding-rtl: 0.375rem 0.75rem;\r\n```\r\nPerhaps it would be good to derive the `ltr` and `rtl` variables from the main one, or set a boolean to allow this just so we don't have to override all three. In writing up the details for this issue I figured out the solution, but I believe this should either be made clear or there might be an opportunity for an enhancement at least.

This also causes display issues on mobile because when the page gets shrunk down to accommodate this larger-than-the-screen element it squashes the .hero-foot element.

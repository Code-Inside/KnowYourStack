Reference that issue as well. -->\r\n\r\nI ran into a compiling error with Bulma 0.8.0 when trying to use `inherit` value for the `$text-strong` variable. I found out this is due to breaking changes in commit 0f988eadd9cbca055966e4418a704b85e19999ff in which a lot of default colors have been modified. This particular line was throwing the error when using `inherit` value for `$text-strong`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$input-placeholder-color: rgba($text-strong, 0.3) !default\r\n``` \r\n\r\nI think we may often use this particular value for the `$text-strong` and `$text-light` variables because there are a lot of cases where a `<strong>` tag in a text should just inherit its parent color. \r\nAlso I think it doesn't really make sense to use the strong text color as default in any other derived variable.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n<!-- Which specific problem does this PR solve and how?  -->\r\n<!-- If it fixes a particular Issue, add \"Fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER\" in your title -->\r\nIn this PR I just put back the old default values, replacing `$text-strong` by `$grey-darker` and `$text-light` by `$grey`. By the way this is what [the docs](https://bulma.io/documentation/form/input/#variables) actually says.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\n<!-- What are the drawbacks of this solution? Are there alternative ones? -->\r\n<!-- Think of performance, build time, usability, complexity, coupling…) -->\r\nThere are still other derived variables which use the `$text-strong` and `$text-light` ones as default. All of these changes have been made in commit 0f988eadd9cbca055966e4418a704b85e19999ff.  \r\nMaybe it could be a better idea to roll back the whole commit but I'm not really sure about that.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\n<!-- BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR PR, MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS: -->\r\n<!-- 1.

To do this, I'm using `requestAnimationFrame` to set a `progress` value which is bound to a bulma progress bar using Buefy.  The values update correctly, but the progress bar doesn't update until the end of the video.  I think it's because the CSS transition of the progress bar is slower than the frequency of the animation, so nothing happens.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nThis single video example demonstrates the issue using Vue and Buefy, but the issue stems from Bulma.\r\n\r\n`VideoPlayer.vue`\r\n```vue\r\n<template>\r\n  <div>\r\n    <b-progress :value=\"progress\" show-value>{{ progress }}%</b-progress>\r\n    <video\r\n      ref=\"player\"\r\n      @play=\"onPlay\"\r\n      @pause=\"onStop\"\r\n      @ended=\"onStop\"\r\n      :src=\"videoUrl\"\r\n    ></video>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {\r\n  name: 'VideoPlayer',\r\n  \r\n  props: ['videoUrl'],\r\n\r\n  data: () => ({\r\n    progress: 0,\r\n    watcher: null\r\n  }),\r\n\r\n  methods: {\r\n    onPlay() {\r\n      this.watcher = requestAnimationFrame(() => this.updateProgress());\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    onStop() {\r\n      cancelAnimationFrame(this.watcher);\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    updateProgress() {\r\n      const { currentTime, duration } = this.$refs.player;\r\n      this.progress = currentTime / duration * 100;\r\n      this.watcher = requestAnimationFrame(() => this.updateProgress());\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2754","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Update progress bar from `requestAnimationFrame`\" (#2754)"},{"Id":"544019016","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2019-12-30T22:27:03","Actor":"xxsuperdreamxx","Number":"2757","RawContent":null,"Title":"Sass base scroll bar issue","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it a bug/feature/question or do you need help?\r\nBug\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\n I'm using Bulma **version** [^0.8.0]\r\n<!-- My **browser** is: Chromium based browser-->\r\nThis is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [^4.13.0]\r\nI am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**?

Reference that issue as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nCurrently, bulma uses a custom implemented `divide` function in multiple functions. The main downside of using this custom division function, is that it uses multiple loops that severely slow down build speeds on the final app.\r\n\r\nThis has been reported previously at #3604, and was been investigated in a separate thread.\r\n\r\nThis pull request replaces the custom `divide` function logic with the built-in sass `math.div` function. This change results in 20x quicker build times with nuxt + vite.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nBecause node-sass has not been updated, there is no support for the `math.div` function. To work around this issue, I've replaced all references with `node-sass` to the `sass` npm package. The functionality is nearly identical, and there should be no modification necessary to any workflows.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nI have built both the main `css` files along with the `rtl-css` files. Both returned perfect results, and no errors were displayed during building.\r\n\r\n### Changelog updated?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks! -->\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/3641","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Replace custom divide function with sass built-in math.div.\" (#3641)"},{"Id":"1683884770","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-25T21:16:04","Actor":"dependabot[bot]","Number":"3640","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump yaml from 2.2.1 to 2.2.2 in /docs","State":"open","Body":"Bumps [yaml](https://github.com/eemeli/yaml) from 2.2.1 to 2.2.2.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/releases\">yaml's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v2.2.2</h2>\n<p>This patch release includes a fix for an error that could be thrown in <code>parseDocument</code> for degenerate input.

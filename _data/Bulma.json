I have a short menu with only 4 small entries want to have a very small breakpoint for the menu (showing the full menu on most devices, and only collapsing to the hamburger menu on very narrow screens.\r\n\r\nIn my SCSS file I have defined `$navbar-breakpoint: 320px;` before including Bulma. \r\n\r\nHere part of my scss files (I also use bulmaswatch)\r\n\r\n    /* Keep the menu visible on most but the smallest devices\r\n    * @devdoc Must be applied before the bulma.sass is used, because this is used there */\r\n    $navbar-breakpoint: 320px;\r\n\r\n    /** Using Bulma CSS with a theme for Bulma */\r\n    @import '../node_modules/bulmaswatch/slate/_variables.scss';\r\n\r\n    @import '../node_modules/bulma/bulma.sass';\r\n    @import '../node_modules/bulmaswatch/slate/_overrides.scss';\r\n\r\n    /* Replayer-specific (smaller) section margins */\r\n    @import 'replayer-section.scss';\r\n\r\n    /* Player styles (to be used for the audio player) */\r\n    @import 'replayer-player-styles.scss';\r\n\r\n    /* Menu styles */\r\n    @import 'replayer-navbar-styles.scss';\r\n\r\n   .... some more specific styles\r\n\r\nThis works nice.\r\n\r\nHowever I also wanted to use the fixed menu only on the larger screens (from desktop).  I encountered the `html.has-navbar-fixed-top-desktop` style, which seems to be undocumented. **This should be documented.**\r\n\r\n**The real problem, however, is, that the aforementioned `$navbar-breakpoint: 320px;` seems to interfere with this `html.has-navbar-fixed-top-desktop`style, setting it now also to 320px, which seems wrong.**\r\n\r\nIt's wrong because it still says \"desktop\" which is far from 320px, and it should also not define the fixed-menu width.\r\n\r\nIn my case I explicitly want to have a full menu on most devices, but only a fixed menu on desktop sizes. As this currently is, I can not control both independently.\r\n\r\nI have created custom scss code to address this, which I like to share, but I guess this should be properly addressed in the framwork itself.\r\n\r\n**Probably all there is to do is to untangle the navbar breakt point from the desktop breakpoint.**\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Description of the bug, enhancement, or question -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

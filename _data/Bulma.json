In fact, the lack of reliance on :root is the reason we chose this over other frameworks (e.g. Bootstrap)...However, this change to tightly couple to the root breaks our encapsulation.\r\n\r\nAre there any plans to reconcile this to keep Bulma flexible or do we need to either roll our own Bulma (maintenance costs for us) or begin looking into alternatives?\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nDownload Bulma 1.x, investigate SASS files.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIdeally, observer Bulma is NOT using :root for css selectors OR supports both :root and :host.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nObserve Bulma is now leveraging :root CSS selectors for core functionality.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3895","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Web Components Broken with 1.x Due to :root\" (#3895)"},{"Id":"2508535674","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-09-05T19:11:44","Actor":"jplatte","Number":"3894","RawContent":null,"Title":"bulma-no-helpers.min.css is missing default variable values","State":"open","Body":"This is about **Bulma**.\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\nI'm using Bulma **version** 1.0.2\r\nMy **browser** is: Firefox Developer Edition\r\nI am _pretty_ sure this issue is **not a duplicate**\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI tried using the no-helpers variant of bulma 1.0.2 and set a couple of custom colors via a secondary css file with some `:root {}` variables.\r\n\r\nWhen loading the page, it's mostly white even though my browser has a dark theme preference set.

So if you have a 2 column layout, the breakpoints will refer to the column width instead of the window width. \r\n\r\nIt is quite confusing that terms like mobile/table/desktop/etc refer to the parent container width, instead of the window width. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"container-fluid\">\r\n  <div class=\"columns is-tablet\">\r\n    <section class=\"column is-6 \">\r\n      <div class=\"fixed-grid has-3-cols-mobile has-4-cols-tablet has-5-cols-desktop has-6-cols-widescreen has-7-cols-fullhd\">\r\n        <ol class=\"grid is-gap-1\">\r\n          <li class=\"cell\">\r\n            This is my cell\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li class=\"cell\">\r\n            This is my cell\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li class=\"cell\">\r\n            This is my cell\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li class=\"cell\">\r\n            This is my cell\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li class=\"cell\">\r\n            This is my cell\r\n          </li>\r\n        </ol>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </section>\r\n    <section class=\"column is-6\">\r\n      <div class=\"fixed-grid has-3-cols-mobile has-4-cols-tablet has-5-cols-desktop has-6-cols-widescreen has-7-cols-fullhd\">\r\n        <ol class=\"grid is-gap-1\">\r\n          <li class=\"cell\">\r\n            This is my cell\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li class=\"cell\">\r\n            This is my cell\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li class=\"cell\">\r\n            This is my cell\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li class=\"cell\">\r\n            This is my cell\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li class=\"cell\">\r\n            This is my cell\r\n          </li>\r\n        </ol>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </section>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect that `has-3-cols-mobile` and `has-4-cols-tablet` are relative to the window size, not the column size.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThose classes should be relative to the window size.

This change ensures that font styles are managed more centrally, making future updates easier and promoting better maintainability.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nThe main tradeoff is that using CSS variables requires browser support. However, most modern browsers support CSS variables, so this is not a significant issue. This approach also increases the reliance on variables for styling, which might add a slight overhead to the CSS parsing process. Alternatives include keeping hardcoded values or using a preprocessor for variable management.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nI tested the CSS changes using a minimal HTML file that includes the updated font-family variables. The changes were verified by comparing the visual output with the previous styles. I also tested the changes in different browsers to ensure consistency. \r\n\r\n### Changelog updated?\r\n\r\nNo. The Changelog has not been updated. If you think this change should be reflected in the Changelog, please let me know.\r\n\r\n### How have you confirmed this feature works?\r\n\r\nI confirmed the feature works by creating a minimal HTML test file that applies the updated font-family variables. The visual output was checked to ensure the correct fonts were applied. Additionally, I tested the changes in multiple browsers to verify compatibility.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/3877","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"update font-family variables\" (#3877)"},{"Id":"2449592622","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-05T22:39:33","Actor":"thesn10","Number":"3876","RawContent":null,"Title":"feat: add panel is-dark, is-light, is-soft, is-bold","State":"open","Body":"This PR adds `is-dark`, `is-light`, `is-soft` and `is-bold` to the panel component.\r\nI have also updated the docs:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5116d1f3-d9d1-4a33-a6b5-ebb2d86e1240)\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nYes, using the docs site.

 $menu-item-active-background-color: transparent`?\r\nThe `:hover` and `:active` styles only override the background luminance delta.\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n    &:hover {\r\n      @include cv.register-vars(\r\n        (\r\n          \"menu-item-background-l-delta\": #{cv.getVar(\r\n              \"menu-item-hover-background-l-delta\"\r\n            )},\r\n        )\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    &:active {\r\n      @include cv.register-vars(\r\n        (\r\n          \"menu-item-background-l-delta\": #{cv.getVar(\r\n              \"menu-item-active-background-l-delta\"\r\n            )},\r\n        )\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo I need to go back to override like this?\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n\r\n@use \"bulma/sass\" with (\r\n  $family-primary: 'Roboto, sans-serif',\r\n  ...\r\n);\r\n\r\n.menu-list {\r\n  a, button, .menu-item {\r\n    &:hover { \r\n      // variant 1\r\n      background-color: transparent;

And there's a big chance to miss something.\r\nThe lower way (variant 2) is just really verbose and it doesn't look like everything's overridable.

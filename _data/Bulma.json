A very common example would be a `dropdown` for each element of the `menu-list`, with the current styling the dropdown styles are completely broken if I use `a` or `button` inside it, and it is not trivial to fix this with custom CSS, since the styles for these tags are reset and overridden with a high specificity.\n\nI think the better approach would be what Bulma is already doing for almost every other element/component: let the designer decide if they want the styles or not with a class (in this case there is already the `menu-item` class that applies exactly the same styles that are applied by default to `a` and `button`).\n\nFor now I am forced to vendor my own version of Bulma just to remove all `.menu-list a,.menu-list button` selectors, leaving only `.menu-list .menu-item`.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3971","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"`menu-list` class should not influence `a` and `button` tags\" (#3971)"},{"Id":"2871112815","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-22T18:02:08","Actor":"Athozus","Number":"3969","RawContent":null,"Title":"Dark tags","State":"open","Body":"Hi,\n\nFirstly thanks for this wonderful framework.\n\nCurrently we have design for dark buttons (there are really adapted to the dark themes gg).

I've made a lot of headway, but am absolutely blocked by select needing to be in a div around a select element.  These older sites are ASP.NET v4 webform style.  So the <asp:DropDownList> controls have a single CssClass=\"select\".  This worked(somehow) for pre-1.0.0, but not working at all for 1.0.3.

Similar logic follows for `<progress>`, `<input>`, etc.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt'd be preferable to have the markup directly applied to `<button>`, `<input>`, etc. tags rather than using the same tag names as class names.

In short, it's a class that, when applied to the `<a>` element, makes the entire containing block, such as cards, clickable as if it were part of the link. This not only improves code readability, but also makes the performed action more clear since it also highlights the `.stretched-link` element.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the closest alternative is to make the box an `<a>` element. While it does the job, it highlights the entire box, and putting any links inside it, like a button, breaks the whole thing.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3574","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add an equivalent of Bootstrap's stretched links\" (#3574)"},{"Id":"1376700786","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-09-17T07:57:05","Actor":"mayur-ekbote","Number":"3573","RawContent":null,"Title":"Start margin of 2rem is added on tabs by default","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\nThis is about **Bulma**.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework** \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAn start margin of 2rem is added to tabs by default.

This PR adds inset shadows only to cards. It does not add any anywhere else.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\n* A user may wish to have both a regular shadow and an inset shadow on their card, which this does not allow.\r\n* If a user overrides `$card-shadow`, `$card-shadow-inset` is unaffected. They would need to modify `$card-shadow-wide` and `$card-shadow-slim` instead.\r\n* It is possible to inset the first of the two shadows simply with `box-shadow: inset $card-shadow`. However, this does not inset the second shadow. Although the second shadow appears to be used as simply a border, in which case whether or not it is inset doesn't really matter visually, in my opinion it is better to build for the long term and account for any additional shadows in the future by creating a variable for each of them (for example, Materialize.css uses combinations of shadows).\r\n\r\n### Testing done\r\n\r\nThe above example is from my local build. I can't for the life of me work out how to rebuild the CSS for the docs, though.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n- [x] Added feature\r\n- [x] Changelog updated (assuming 0.9.1)\r\n- [x] Docs updated (assuming 0.9.1)","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/3084","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add inset shadows to cards — partially fixes #2423\" (#3084)"},{"Id":"678643794","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-13T19:38:55","Actor":"vxfil","Number":"3082","RawContent":null,"Title":"block is not vertically centered","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Is it a bug/feature/question or do you need help? -->\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **CSS framework** -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nplease tell me how to center the block vertically\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div className=\"columns is-centered is-vcentered is-desktop\">\r\n      <div className=\"column is-one-quarter\">\r\n        <div className=\"box\">\r\n            // code...\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n </div>\r\n```\r\n![screen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46137927/90171679-842de300-ddaa-11ea-9cf1-8cfea4c631b4.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3082","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"block is not vertically centered\" (#3082)"},{"Id":"678423416","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-13T13:08:03","Actor":"elfin-sbreuers","Number":"3081","RawContent":null,"Title":"refactor: split out responsiveness mixins","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n<!-- DO NOT REBUILD THE CSS OUTPUT IN YOUR PR -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is an improvement.\r\n\r\n<!-- Improvement?

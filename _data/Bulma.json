If I want a more compact menu on a certain range of screen sizes, by reducing the padding, I'd immediately have to start writing exceptions in my css. I'd much rather add a single class to the component, like: .p-2-tablet, to get the desired result. If I want similar behaviour on 3 components, I'd have 3 exceptions in my css, when that could be replaced by simply adding classes. If I want different behaviour in a one case I can simply remove the class on that specific page instead of having to create an exception on the already created exception.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nThe only trade-off I see, is potentially bloating the bulma css output. I personally think the improvement outweighs this drawback, but I'm very eager to hear more opinions.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nI've tested multiple responsive spacing helpers per spacing type and direction (or axis).\r\n\r\n### Changelog updated?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/3179","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Responsive spacing helpers\" (#3179)"},{"Id":"740548679","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-11T07:46:37","Actor":"ryanlid","Number":"3178","RawContent":null,"Title":"table content  overflow in .content","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma**.\r\n\r\n<!-- Is it about Bulma or about the Docs? -->\r\n<!-- Is it a bug/feature/question or do you need help? -->\r\n<!-- If it's a bug, is it a browser bug? -->\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **Docs** -->\r\nI'm using Bulma **version** [0.9.1]\r\nMy **browser** is: Microsoft Edge 86\r\n<!-- This is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- I am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**? -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Description of the bug, enhancement, or question -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n1.

Add the `is-static` class along with a color class such as `is-primary` to any compatible element.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nScenario 1:\r\nApplies static's `pointer-events` and `box-shadow` properties while matching with the selected color palette.\r\n\r\nScenario 2:\r\nApplying `<class=\"is-static is-primary\" disabled>` treats the button like `<class=\"is-static disabled>` but with the additional `is-static` properties so that there would be no `pointer` or `box-shadow`. These should work together because for one it causes it to be unreadable and a user might want an element to appear with the custom shaded disabled styling just without any `pointer-event`. \r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nScenario 1:\r\nFor instance styling, a button with `\"is-primary is-static\" overpowers `is-primary`'s color palette. \r\n\r\nscenario 2:\r\nStyling a button as `<class=\"is-static is-primary\" disabled>` keeps the chosen color palette class but applies `is-static`'s `color` property which makes it unreadable.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3177","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Feature] Allow is-static chaining with color classes and disabled prop\" (#3177)"},{"Id":"738287216","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-07T18:15:21","Actor":"jgthms","Number":"3176","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use imports everywhere","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n<!-- DO NOT REBUILD THE CSS OUTPUT IN YOUR PR -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is an **improvement**.\r\n\r\n<!-- New feature?

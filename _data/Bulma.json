It is simple enough to add intermediate variables as customization points for the colors of each element or component, allowing us to do this.

To be thematically-consistent, I wanted to use the inverse of Bulma's shadow. However, no such option was available.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the option to replace a card's default shadow with an inset shadow using the `is-inset` modifier.\r\n\r\nI have added the `is-inset` class to cards, which replaces the default shadow with its inverse.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29130152/90246186-ef6bc980-de2b-11ea-995f-905bf8cd1e3a.png)\r\n\r\nThis addresses but does not fix <!-- --> #2423, which makes a request for inset shadows. This PR adds inset shadows only to cards. It does not add any anywhere else.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\n* A user may wish to have both a regular shadow and an inset shadow on their card, which this does not allow.\r\n* If a user overrides `$card-shadow`, `$card-shadow-inset` is unaffected. They would need to modify `$card-shadow-wide` and `$card-shadow-slim` instead.\r\n* It is possible to inset the first of the two shadows simply with `box-shadow: inset $card-shadow`. However, this does not inset the second shadow. Although the second shadow appears to be used as simply a border, in which case whether or not it is inset doesn't really matter visually, in my opinion it is better to build for the long term and account for any additional shadows in the future by creating a variable for each of them (for example, Materialize.css uses combinations of shadows).\r\n\r\n### Testing done\r\n\r\nThe above example is from my local build.

We currently use Bulma in production, but we've had several issues which we ended up having to solve by going to great wavelengths, which could be just easily fixed by merging a Pull Request.\r\n\r\nHow is it that a lot of popular issues do not really get addressed despite being very popular & being open since early 2018-2019, but I'm seeing sponsoring options everywhere?\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to bash on Bulma or anything, we use it in production, but we've had tremendous amount of work in customisation and basic things Bulma does not provide out of the box (which, in my opinion, it should). I've also seen plenty of issues (which were great ideas) being quickly disregarded by the author, instead of being properly addressed.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it seems as though more work is being put in the sponsoring/commercialising of Bulma (which is everywhere, for some reason) than there is in actually improving the framework by useful features and optimizations. Bootstrap (and Buefy), for example, rarely or never even ask for sponsoring of any kind of financial compensations.\r\n\r\nI am not against sponsoring or helping out, but community help such as issues & recommendations like these are worth much more than a couple sponsors (in my opinion).\r\n\r\n@jgthms If you need to make a revenue in order to sustain Bulma, I'd recommend creating/building themes, like Bootstrap does, https://themes.getbootstrap.com/ -- and selling them in order to also provide value to end-users who would like to financially contribute by getting a theme & saving time in the process.\r\n\r\nAgain, great work on Bulma, but I've seen a lot of nearly instant negativity on issues being opened that actually contain great feedback & solutions. I've seen plenty of people having to create custom CSS in Bulma issues because the issue got disregarded and was never even closed as well.\r\n\r\n### Examples (Issues)\r\n#### Search\r\n- Issue #2936. \r\n- Issue #1325, contains tons of people complaining about no response to issues. \r\n\r\n#### Docs\r\nPlenty of people complain about the documentation having too many clicks, difficult searching & just lacking behind in terms of other documentation sites / options (such as, Vue.js, Bootstrap, etc.). \r\n\r\n### Examples (Pull Requests)\r\n#### Search\r\n- Issue #2936. \r\n- Issue #1325, contains tons of people complaining about no response to issues. \r\n\r\nPRs mentioning the docs: https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+docs -- contain plenty of pull requests with documentation improvements, not being merged.\r\n\r\nThere's way too much pull requests opened, with no response and nothing. Issues & feedback requests as well.\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\nI didn't have time to list everything here, but if you just look thoroughly through every issue & Pull Request in this repository, you can see a lot of issues being quickly disregarded + pull request criticism & after that; no response. \r\n\r\nInstead of focusing on sponsors @jgthms -- you can improve the community, which would eliminate the need for financial support? I'm not very understanding of the desperate need for sponsors, if this is a community based / open source project anyway. No harm to you, but Bulma is the most commercialised repository / open source project I've ever seen on GitHub, or anywhere for that matter. I'd suggest making money some other way, like I mentioned (using Themes).\r\n\r\n### Proposed solutions\r\nTry getting new people / managers on board, move to a 'bulmacss' GitHub Teams, invite people and get more people in the repository.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3074","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Bulma, step up your game\" (#3074)"},{"Id":"672697512","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-08-04T10:49:27","Actor":"simplenotezy","Number":"3073","RawContent":null,"Title":"Buggy behavior when upgrading from 0.8.2 to 0.9","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\nThis is about **Bulma**.\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen upgrading to 0.9 from 0.8.2, it looks like this:\r\n\r\n**0.9.0**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3786627/89285255-529d7500-d650-11ea-8976-2a36d0623ab2.png)\r\n\r\n**0.8.2**\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3786627/89285476-ba53c000-d650-11ea-8932-78c4d0e98c26.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

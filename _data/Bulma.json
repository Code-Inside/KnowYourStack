As I upgraded from 0.9.4 -> 1.0.0 I could not find a way to opt-out of the automatically applied dark-mode theming and thus breaks my own styling for the dark mode. I also use an angular service to determine whether to apply the dark mode based on the users settings from the localstorage or if that hasn't been set it uses the clients OS settings.\r\n\r\nThis is how I used to check for my own applied dark mode now with updated css variables in Angular.\r\n\r\n```css\r\nbody.dark :host .node {\r\n    background-color: hsla(\r\n        (var(--bulma-white-h)),\r\n        (var(--bulma-white-s)),\r\n            (var(--bulma-white-l)),\r\n        0.3);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Basically: can anyone tell me how to disable this feature until I find time to change my approach in the future?**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nDo not apply the dark mode unless I explicitly set \r\n`class=\"theme-dark\"` or  `data-theme=\"dark\"` on the body of my project.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nIt automatically uses the media query --prefers-color-scheme and changes the styling.\r\n\r\nThis is my own dark-mode which is not perfect but is alright for the time being:\r\n![image](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/assets/15277745/b9272f1f-f0cf-4f9e-a1fc-1a63195f134f)\r\n\r\nThis is my dark-theme applied on top of the bulma --prefers-color-scheme styles\r\n![image](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/assets/15277745/4217bd8b-9ec9-4dce-976f-ced33223be46)\r\n\r\nThis is what it currently looks like without my own dark-mode. I haven't come around to changing everything to the new css variables (previously sass variables) yet which is why some text is black on black background. Not sure why it compiled in the first place but sometimes angular doesn't pick up on things like this.\r\n![image](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/assets/15277745/8d7756b5-4336-4a5a-9067-993288e23079)\r\n\r\nI am sorry if I missed something obvious that could solve my problem. \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3746","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Disable automatic dark mode theming\" (#3746)"},{"Id":"2202493272","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-03-24T20:36:24","Actor":"gxres042","Number":"3729","RawContent":null,"Title":"@use \"bulma/sass\" with (); may conflict with Modularity","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma**, and it is a question.\r\n\r\n<!-- Is it about Bulma or about the Docs? -->\r\n<!-- Is it a bug/feature/question or do you need help? -->\r\n<!-- If it's a bug, is it a browser bug? -->\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS Framework**, version 1.0.

Even some customization can be done with CSS only (using CSS variables), Sass seems to be required only for advanced usage/customization.\r\n- `sass` dependency could be moved to `devDependencies` in order to reduce the package installation size, developers can still install `sass` when they need to use Bulma Sass files.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n1.

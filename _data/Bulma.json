This extension can make websites into dark mode ( has 4 modes ). This extension does not work well for Bulma's docs because colors are affected. Usually in other documentations code is important. It is so annoying to hurt my eyes only on Bulma's website when I code at night. I don't ask to bring dark mode in Bulma as whole, just on website, so I can read docs without burning my eyes.

\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen adding bulma to Nuxt modules, vite server starts up really slowly, up to a minute for some users. It has already been raised as Nuxt and Vite github issues but devs there have said bulma is the cause.\r\n\r\nOne interesting comment (https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/13824) says bulma uses old division code from Bootstrap, which is the underlying cause. Please investigate and issue fix if that is the case.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create new Nuxt project using `npx nuxi init nuxt-test`\r\n2. `code nuxt-test`\r\n3. `yarn install`\r\n4.  Start `vite` server, it starts up within a few seconds\r\n5.  `yarn add bulma`\r\n6.  Add `bulma` to `css` property:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport default defineNuxtConfig({\r\n  css: [\r\n    'bulma',\r\n  ]\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n8. Start `vite` server using `yarn dev -o` now it takes anywhere from 20 seconds to a minute\r\n9. Take out `bulma` from css property and `vite` will start up in 3 seconds.\r\n\r\nPlease see https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/11221 and https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/13824\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nVite should start up quickly, as that is one of its major features.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nVite starts up real slow (possibly due to some division loops within bulma code -- see description)\r\n\r\nWith bulma:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47725053/208984240-45ad269f-8447-4adf-8c7d-5aebfccfc9f3.png)\r\n\r\nWithout:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47725053/208984464-34431ca9-25fc-414a-8f35-63140db7dd90.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3604","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Importing bulma in Nuxt 3 config css property causes super slow Vite startup\" (#3604)"},{"Id":"1476390681","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-12-09T11:48:04","Actor":"janosrusiczki","Number":"3600","RawContent":null,"Title":"Is it possible to have level-left fill the available space?","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma**.\r\n\r\n<!-- Is it about Bulma or about the Docs? -->\r\nIs it a bug/feature/question or do you need help?\r\n<!-- If it's a bug, is it a browser bug? -->\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **Docs** -->\r\n<!-- I'm using Bulma **version** [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- My **browser** is: -->\r\n<!-- This is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- I am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**? -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have a `level` block with `level-left` and `level-right`.

As much as I like the aesthetics portrayed by the CSS framework, it is unclear as to why one would not prefer using the framework to markup the style just by using the native HTML tags, e.g. have `<button>XYZ</button>` instead of `<button class=\"button\">XYZ</button>`. Similar logic follows for `<progress>`, `<input>`, etc.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt'd be preferable to have the markup directly applied to `<button>`, `<input>`, etc. tags rather than using the same tag names as class names. The only place where class names should include tag names is where one is supposed to be represented in the form of the other.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3589","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Remove repetition of class name for native HTML elements\" (#3589)"},{"Id":"1440520545","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-08T16:27:02","Actor":"Eduruiz","Number":"3588","RawContent":null,"Title":"Accessibility issue with bulma reset ","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma**.\r\n\r\n<!-- Is it about Bulma or about the Docs? -->\r\n<!-- Is it a bug/feature/question or do you need help? -->\r\n<!-- If it's a bug, is it a browser bug? -->\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **Docs** -->\r\n<!-- I'm using Bulma **version** [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- My **browser** is: -->\r\n<!-- This is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- I am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**? -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Description of the bug, enhancement, or question -->\r\nBulma reset file has a `font-size: 16px;` declaration in the `html`, this breaks the accessibility of websites for users who have vision impairment and scale up the font size of the browser.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. set your font with relative units\r\n2. update your browser font-size preferences\r\n3. check your website\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe font size of the entire application (and all other relative set sizes) should scale up with the chosen size\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nNothing changes since the `html` font-size are set in pixels\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3588","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Accessibility issue with bulma reset \" (#3588)"},{"Id":"1437564912","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-06T22:33:59","Actor":"andreobriennz","Number":"3587","RawContent":null,"Title":"Image in modal has white space below if used with content next to it","State":"open","Body":"This is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\nI'm using Bulma **0.9.4**, but have also noticed this in other versions over the past 2-3 years.\r\nMy browsers Firefox and Chrome (Macbook Pro 13\").\r\nI've noticed is multiple Sass versions.\r\nI have checked this is not a duplicate.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen using a modal with an image on the left and text on the right there is always white space below the image, even if there is very little text next to it. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nAdd the following code to any project (replacing `src=\"...\"` with an actual image URL):\r\n```\r\n        <div class=\"modal is-active\" >\r\n            <div class=\"modal-background\"></div>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"modal-content\">\r\n                <div class=\"modal-image\">\r\n                    <img src=\"...\" />\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div class=\"modal-text\">\r\n                    <h2>Some Heading</h2>\r\n                    <div>Text</div>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nThe modal appears with no white space below the image.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nThere is always about 5px of white space below the image. \r\n\r\nIt can be fixed with the following code but I wonder if it would be better for this to be fixed in the Bulma framework?\r\n\r\n```\r\n    .modal-image {\r\n        overflow: hidden;\r\n        img {\r\n            height: 100%;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3587","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Image in modal has white space below if used with content next to it\" (#3587)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2023-01-22T03:30:10.2874956Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":696}

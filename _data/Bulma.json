When you click on the button a popup/modal is opened. When the modal/opens, the background content should not be scrollable. Only the modal should be scrollable. When you implement this feature with bulma. The issue I'm having is with the body scroll lock. When the modal is open, I'm still able to scroll the body. Only the modal should be scrollable.\r\n\r\nI've created a simple example of my scenario on code sandbox `https://codesandbox.io/s/bulma-nextjs-contextual-routing-with-modal-9bifu?file=/pages/index.js`\r\n\r\nAfter digging through bulma code base, it looks like these two lines in` bulma/base/generic.sass`\r\n```\r\nhtml\r\n  overflow-y: $body-overflow-y\r\n  overflow-x: $body-overflow-x\r\n```\r\n\r\nis causing the issue. After removing those two lines, it starts working.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWhen modal opens, background content should not be scrollable. Only the modal content should be scrollable.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe background content is scrollable\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3250","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Bulma 0.9.1 causing issues with body scroll lock\" (#3250)"},{"Id":"795433716","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-27T23:30:43","Actor":"jgthms","Number":"3249","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bulma v9 website","State":"closed","Body":"This is a **documentation fix**.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nImprove the documentation website by implementing a better layout, adding Algolia search, and fixing CSS bugs.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nFont Awesome had to be added locally.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nMostly visual testing, and Bulma builds correctly.\r\n\r\n### Changelog updated?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/3249","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bulma v9 website\" (#3249)"},{"Id":"795367817","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-27T19:08:53","Actor":"ozdemirburak","Number":"3248","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix icon-text icon margin for rtl","State":"open","Body":"This is a **improvement**.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes icon-text icon margin for RTL.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n \r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nI ran `npm run rtll` and checked `css/bulma-rtl.min.css css/bulma-rtl.css` file.\r\n\r\n### Changelog updated?\r\n\r\nNo.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/3248","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix icon-text icon margin for rtl\" (#3248)"},{"Id":"794623190","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-01-26T22:56:46","Actor":"jimblue","Number":"3247","RawContent":null,"Title":"Broken extends.sass import with release 0.9.2 ","State":"open","Body":"Following breaking advice from latest release don't work:\r\n> To fix duplicate imports, all Sass placeholders have moved from the utilities/mixins file to its own utilities/extends file.

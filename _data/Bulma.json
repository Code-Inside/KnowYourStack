The `.container` class that I wrap my two-column page in has a max width of 1344px, which means that my monitor has more white space than content. (3440px monitor - 1344px of content = 2096px of whitespace)\r\n\r\nNow, I get that designing for these is difficult so I'd fully understand if they're just beyond the scope of what's reasonable to implement at this time (as they aren't super common, so diminishing returns on effort) but I'm wondering if there are any plans to add a larger breakpoint than fullscreen for monitors like mine?\r\n\r\nI do appreciate that I can edit these vars myself, and even if I did, widescreens would likely need an edited UI regardless. \r\n\r\nJust curious as towards your thoughts on if this is something worth implementing.

Yes\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nCombining `.is-static` with another color class for instance as with `.is-primary` and `.is-disabled` or `.is-light` does not produce complementary behavior as `.is-static` overrides the color class' property.\r\n\r\n#### Why?\r\n1) For better flexibility and consistency I think it would make sense to have `is-static` be properly chainable with color classes as well as with `is-light` and `disabled` so developers can use it in combination to achieve a specific desired effect.`\r\n\r\n2) I believe `disabled` used to have this issue (not currently able to reproduce it) where this opens the door for color pallets that are hardly readable which is poor for accessibility, where it is difficult for any user to read.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Add the `is-static` class along with a color class such as `is-primary` to any compatible element.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nScenario 1:\r\nApplies static's `pointer-events` and `box-shadow` properties while matching with the selected color palette.\r\n\r\nScenario 2:\r\nApplying `<class=\"is-static is-primary\" disabled>` treats the button like `<class=\"is-static disabled>` but with the additional `is-static` properties so that there would be no `pointer` or `box-shadow`. These should work together because for one it causes it to be unreadable and a user might want an element to appear with the custom shaded disabled styling just without any `pointer-event`. \r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nScenario 1:\r\nFor instance styling, a button with `\"is-primary is-static\" overpowers `is-primary`'s color palette. \r\n\r\nscenario 2:\r\nStyling a button as `<class=\"is-static is-primary\" disabled>` keeps the chosen color palette class but applies `is-static`'s `color` property which makes it unreadable.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3177","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Feature] Allow is-static chaining with color classes and disabled prop\" (#3177)"},{"Id":"738287216","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-11-07T18:15:21","Actor":"jgthms","Number":"3176","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use imports everywhere","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n<!-- DO NOT REBUILD THE CSS OUTPUT IN YOUR PR -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is an **improvement**.\r\n\r\n<!-- New feature?

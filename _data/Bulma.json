I have customized Bulma quite a lot and have plenty of custom colors, variables and so on so I know my SASS file is working fine, but since upgrading to 0.9.0 I am unable to update the notification padding without also updating the variables for `ltr` and `rtl`. Should the ltr & rtl variables be derived perhaps? \r\n<!-- Description of the bug, enhancement, or question -->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Create a sass file per the docs in order to customize Bulma\r\n2. Override the `$notification-padding` variable, a la `$notification-padding: 0.375rem 0.75rem;`\r\n3. Import Bulma as normal: `@import \"~bulma/bulma\";`\r\n<!--\r\n1. First Step\r\n2. Second Step\r\n3. and so on...\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNotification padding should be set to `0.375rem 0.75rem`\r\n<!-- What you expected to happen -->\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nNotification padding remains at the default value in `~bulma/bulma/sass/elements/notification.sass`: `$notification-padding: 1.25rem 2.5rem 1.25rem 1.5rem !default`\r\n\r\nThis can be overcome by also overriding the other padding variables in this file, but this is not immediately clear to people who had adjusted it prior to the addition of the `ltr` and `rtl` variables:\r\n```\r\n$notification-padding: 0.375rem 0.75rem;\r\n$notification-padding-ltr: 0.375rem 0.75rem;\r\n$notification-padding-rtl: 0.375rem 0.75rem;\r\n```\r\nPerhaps it would be good to derive the `ltr` and `rtl` variables from the main one, or set a boolean to allow this just so we don't have to override all three. In writing up the details for this issue I figured out the solution, but I believe this should either be made clear or there might be an opportunity for an enhancement at least.

There should be no whitespace underneath the .hero-foot.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe .columns element is wider than the page (it appears to be always by 24px). This also causes display issues on mobile because when the page gets shrunk down to accommodate this larger-than-the-screen element it squashes the .hero-foot element. There's also some whitespace underneath the .hero-foot.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2020-06-29 at 15 51 17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52198062/86021477-05aafb00-ba21-11ea-80f5-7cb3d86a2b8b.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3023","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".columns exceeds width of the page in a .hero-foot and adds whitespace at bottom of page\" (#3023)"},{"Id":"647283374","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-29T11:24:40","Actor":"svdHero","Number":"3022","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add width weights for table columns when using the table class","State":"open","Body":"This is a feature request for Bulma.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen I use a `table` with many columns inside a `table-container`, the line breaks in the table cells' content can be really ugly.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if one could add weights to the columns in order to have more control over the width of a column.\r\nMaybe something similar as with the `column` class, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n    <div class=\"table-container\">\r\n        <table class=\"table is-narrow is-bordered is-striped is-hoverable is-fullwidth\">\r\n            <thead>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                    <th class=\"is-half\">Foo</th>\r\n                    <th class=\"is-one-quarter\">Bar</th>\r\n                    <th class=\"is-one-quarter\">Umu</th>\r\n                </tr>\r\n            </thead>\r\n            <tbody>\r\n                ...\r\n            </tbody>\r\n        </table>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3022","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add width weights for table columns when using the table class\" (#3022)"},{"Id":"646893729","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-28T11:19:14","Actor":"codeyash","Number":"3021","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove weight from has-text-weight-light and similar ones","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nhas-text-weight-light | Transforms text weight to light\r\n-- | --\r\nhas-text-weight-normal | Transforms text weight to normal\r\nhas-text-weight-medium | Transforms text weight to medium\r\nhas-text-weight-semibold | Transforms text weight to semi-bold\r\nhas-text-weight-bold | Transforms text weight to bold\r\n\r\nSounds little long\r\n\r\nhas-text-bold is enough\r\n\r\nRemove weight from all :)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3021","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Remove weight from has-text-weight-light and similar ones\" (#3021)"},{"Id":"646685668","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-27T13:46:06","Actor":"ambrt","Number":"3020","RawContent":null,"Title":"ma and pa - margin and padding for all sides","State":"open","Body":"**Feature proposal**\r\n\r\nAlong m* and p* helpers there could be all sides helpers.

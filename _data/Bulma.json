Addresses #3025 \r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nUnify the usage of ltr and rtl padding values behind one variable, `$notification-padding`.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `$notification-padding` is set, but isn't used at all. The real padding is written using `+ltr` / `+rtl` mixins, and using the specific values `$notification-padding-ltr` and `$notification-padding-rtl`. \r\n\r\nThis obscures what we really want to do: __Offer a configurable value for padding, and set an appropriate default based on the value of `$rtl`.__\r\n\r\nTo correct this, we create a 4th variable, `$default-notification-padding`, which is populated by `@if $rtl`, then set the default (replaceable) value of `$notification-padding` with this new variable.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\n- Add a new variable that isn't necessarily worth documenting, and makes this definition more verbose\r\n- Add an insignificant amount of compute time during render\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\n<!-- BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR PR, MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS: -->\r\n- [x] Pull the latest `master` branch\r\n- [x] Make sure your Sass code is compliant with the [Bulma Sass styleguide](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#bulma-sass-styleguide)\r\n- [x] Make sure your PR only affects `.sass` or documentation files\r\n- [x] [Try your changes](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#try-your-changes).\r\n\r\nThe following code blocks are pairs of (test case `bulma.sass`, and the output of `grep -A4 \"\\.notification {\" css/bulma.css` after running `npm run build`):\r\n\r\n```bulma.sass\r\n@charset \"utf-8\"\r\n/*! bulma.io v0.9.4 | MIT License | github.com/jgthms/bulma */\r\n@import \"sass/utilities/_all\"\r\n@import \"sass/elements/notification.sass\"\r\n```\r\n```css/bulma.css\r\n.notification {\r\n  background-color: whitesmoke;\r\n  border-radius: 4px;\r\n  position: relative;\r\n  padding: 1.25rem 2.5rem 1.25rem 1.5rem;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere we see the default still stays ready for ltr with a delete button on the right.\r\n\r\n```bulma.sass\r\n@charset \"utf-8\"\r\n/*! bulma.io v0.9.4 | MIT License | github.com/jgthms/bulma */\r\n@import \"sass/utilities/_all\"\r\n$rtl: true\r\n@import \"sass/elements/notification.sass\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```css/bulma.css\r\n.notification {\r\n  background-color: whitesmoke;\r\n  border-radius: 4px;\r\n  position: relative;\r\n  padding: 1.25rem 1.5rem 1.25rem 2.5rem;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen `$rtl` is enabled, the padding is now updated without any other changes.\r\n\r\n```bulma.sass\r\n@charset \"utf-8\"\r\n/*! bulma.io v0.9.4 | MIT License | github.com/jgthms/bulma */\r\n@import \"sass/utilities/_all\"\r\n$rtl: true\r\n$notification-padding: 0px\r\n@import \"sass/elements/notification.sass\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```css/bulma.css\r\n.notification {\r\n  background-color: whitesmoke;\r\n  border-radius: 4px;\r\n  position: relative;\r\n  padding: 0px;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow even with `$rtl` enabled, the output is still the specified value of `$notification-padding`.\r\n\r\n### Changelog updated?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks! -->\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/3544","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix usage of ltr/rtl padding for notifications (Fixes #3025)\" (#3544)"},{"Id":"1268648929","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-06-12T17:24:41","Actor":"SomeMinecraftModder","Number":"3543","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add new typography helper","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n<!-- DO NOT REBUILD THE CSS OUTPUT IN YOUR PR -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is a **new feature**.\r\n<!-- New feature?

The text input field does focus indication very well.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3529","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Tabs do not indicate focus well\" (#3529)"},{"Id":"1239264805","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-18T06:52:17","Actor":"doerner","Number":"3528","RawContent":null,"Title":"Change Suggestion for tabs","State":"closed","Body":"This is about **Bulma .\r\n\r\nThis is a request for change the \"tabs\"-setup in Bulma to reduce JavaScript for a solution .\r\n\r\nIn the current version of Bulma, you need JS to change the active tab and to \r\nshow a different content-panel associated with the new tab selected.\r\n\r\nBut there are pure CSS solutions (making use of the :checked-property) \r\nfor this problem if you use radio-buttons instead of the link <a>.\r\nhttps://codepen.io/markcaron/pen/MvGRYV\r\n\r\nTherefore I suggest to base the \"tabs\" on \"radio buttons\" and \"labels\" instead of  <ul> and <a>-tags so that such a pure css solution is feasible to implement.\r\n \r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3528","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Change Suggestion for tabs\" (#3528)"},{"Id":"1235795814","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-14T06:15:25","Actor":"askmrsinh","Number":"3527","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove duplicate link","State":"closed","Body":"Fix for the duplicate 'love' link in footer:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"672\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6129517/168401890-b300ee69-29e9-463e-addc-a89f05cd2d77.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `site.data.links.more` array already includes 'love':\r\nhttps://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/a170216c6cd356cb89b1bdc31e0da1472cbfd2b2/docs/_data/links.json#L694\r\n\r\n<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n<!-- DO NOT REBUILD THE CSS OUTPUT IN YOUR PR -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is a **documentation fix**.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/3527","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Remove duplicate link\" (#3527)"},{"Id":"1235191738","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-13T12:39:44","Actor":"atilafb","Number":"3526","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fixes #3468","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n<!-- DO NOT REBUILD THE CSS OUTPUT IN YOUR PR -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is a **bugfix | documentation fix**.\r\n<!-- New feature?

Bring up a page containing an instance of the  `select` class which has `<options>`. (For example, https://bulma.io/documentation/form/select/.)\r\n2. Using the browser developer tools, edit one of the `<option>` tags to contain a `selected` attribute, e.g. `<option selected=\"selected\">`.\r\n3. It may be necessary to repeat this a few times, moving the `selected` attribute to different options, before the bug is reproduced.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe option selected in the dropdown display changes to match the `<option>` with the `selected` attribute. (This is the behaviour when the same steps are performed on e.g. https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_select).\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nInitially, the actual behaviour may appear to match the expected behaviour. However, after a few repeats of the above steps, the displayed option selection no longer changes when the `selected` attribute is moved. As a result, the underlying value of the dropdown may become different from the value the user thinks it has.

The described workflow doesn't include running autoprefixer, and the resulting generated bulma.css is different from the official one (I count 11 different properties, mainly related to animation).\r\n\r\nThe docs should either make it clear that autoprefixer is also a dependency, or at least warn that css files produced without it might be different from the official one.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Follow the steps on [this page](https://bulma.io/documentation/customize/with-node-sass/), up to \"To test it out, go in your terminal and run the following command: npm run css-build\".\r\n2. Compare the generated css file with bulma.css\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWith no customization, users expect the files to be the same.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nFiles differ on the following browser-prefixed properties:\r\n\r\n    -webkit-animation: spinAround 500ms infinite linear;\r\n    -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\r\n    -moz-text-size-adjust: 100%;\r\n    @-webkit-keyframes spinAround {...}\r\n    -webkit-animation-duration: 1.5s;\r\n    -webkit-animation-iteration-count: infinite;\r\n    -webkit-animation-name: moveIndeterminate;\r\n    -webkit-animation-timing-function: linear;\r\n    @-webkit-keyframes moveIndeterminate {...}\r\n    min-height: -webkit-min-content;\r\n    min-height: -moz-min-content;","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3520","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Document dependency on autoprefixer or warn about its usage\" (#3520)"},{"Id":"1228031938","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-06T16:22:45","Actor":"petasittek","Number":"3519","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove useless console.log() from Modal example","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n<!-- DO NOT REBUILD THE CSS OUTPUT IN YOUR PR -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is a **documentation fix**.\r\n<!-- New feature?

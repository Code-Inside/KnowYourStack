It looks like I will need to use the Menu component, but I can't get it to expand to full height and to stay fixed while the main canvas scrolls.\r\n\r\nCan you kindly point me in the right direction?\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJames Cropcho","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2977","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Creating fixed vertical navigation (a Menu?): initial guidance\" (#2977)"},{"Id":"627817900","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-30T20:44:55","Actor":"kevinastock","Number":"2976","RawContent":null,"Title":"Empty span with class icon in table cell causes row to be taller.","State":"open","Body":"This is about **Bulma**. \r\n\r\nIt is a bug. I do not believe it is a browser bug\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\nI'm using Bulma **version** [0.8.2] \r\nMy **browser** is: Firefox 76.0.1 and Chromium 83.0.4103.61\r\n<!-- This is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- I am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**? -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Description of the bug, enhancement, or question -->\r\nSetting the contents of a `<td>` to `<span class=\"icon\"></span>` makes the row taller. Adding inner contents to the span reduces the height of the row to the expected value.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n    <head>\r\n        <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\r\n        <title>empty span.icon in tables</title>\r\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\r\n        <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bulma@0.8.2/css/bulma.min.css\" integrity=\"sha256-qS+snwBgqr+iFVpBB58C9UCxKFhyL03YHpZfdNUhSEw=\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\">\r\n    </head>\r\n    <body>\r\n        <table class=\"table\">\r\n            <tbody>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                    <td></td>\r\n                    <td></td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n\r\n                <tr>\r\n                    <td>\r\n                        <span></span>\r\n                    </td>\r\n                    <td>\r\n                        Empty span is short\r\n                    </td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n\r\n                <tr>\r\n                    <td>\r\n                        <span class=\"icon\"></span>\r\n                    </td>\r\n                    <td>\r\n                        Empty span.icon is tall\r\n                    </td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n\r\n                <tr>\r\n                    <td>\r\n                        <span class=\"icon\">x</span>\r\n                    </td>\r\n                    <td>\r\n                        span.icon with contents is short\r\n                    </td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n\r\n                <tr>\r\n                    <td></td>\r\n                    <td></td>\r\n                </tr>\r\n            </tbody>\r\n        </table>\r\n    </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpening this page in firefox and chromium shows the issue. The middle row is 47 pixels tall on my computer, the other two are 41 pixels tall. The extra row at the start and the bottom are just to make comparison of the other rows fair.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect all three rows with contents to be 41 pixels tall.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe empty row with a `span.icon` is taller. I can resolve this on my end by putting a `&nbsp;` inside the span. Removing the `<!DOCTYPE html>` also fixes the issue in both firefox and chromium.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2976","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Empty span with class icon in table cell causes row to be taller.\" (#2976)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2020-06-20T05:30:18.1371952Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":690}

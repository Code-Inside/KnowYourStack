If the screen width is high enough, such that the grouped field is in one row, everything is fine. However, on mobile, whenever the group is broken into two lines, the last one has zero margin to the bottom. Meaning that, if you stack grouped multilined fields together, there is no space between them on a mobile device. The issue https://github.com/buefy/buefy/issues/1313 probably has the same root cause. There is mentioned that the issue is due to the margin-bottom: 0 at the last child.\r\n\r\nSee the jsfiddle to reproduce the problem https://jsfiddle.net/dmx83v65/ If you shrink the viewer width until the multiline field breaks the line due to responsive layout, you will see that there is not space between the two grouped-multilined fields (between input with placeholder 2 and input with placeholder 3)\r\n\r\nHere is a picture of what happens:\r\n\r\n![bulma](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9616291/144458250-c340339f-007d-4837-bd91-8731cea07ff9.png)\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a grouped multilined field\r\n2. Create a child field (nested)\r\n3. Make a copy of the whole nested fields and paste to the end\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe spacing is not broken in case of nested fields\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThere is no space after the multiline field\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3453","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Grouped fields have no margin in case of nested fields\" (#3453)"},{"Id":"1067091827","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-12-01T08:49:53","Actor":"Bald-mans","Number":"3452","RawContent":null,"Title":"I can't log in to bulmo.

For the top row, I use code like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"columns\">\r\n    <div class=\"column\">\r\n        <div class=\"block\">\r\n            <div class=\"card\">\r\n                <div class=\"card-image\">\r\n                    <figure class=\"image is-square\">\r\n                        <a href=\"<%= it.image_1_full %>\">\r\n                            <img src=\"<%= it.image_1_full %>\" alt=\"Placeholder image\">\r\n                        </a>\r\n                    </figure>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"column\">\r\n        <div class=\"block\">\r\n            <div class=\"card\">\r\n                <div class=\"card-image\">\r\n                    <figure class=\"image is-square\">\r\n                        <a href=\"<%= it.image_2_full %>\">\r\n                            <img src=\"<%= it.image_2_full %>\" alt=\"Placeholder image\">\r\n                        </a>\r\n                    </figure>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will all work fine, until I combine two images next to one big one like so:\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36443026/141297527-86b9fb3e-ed53-4c95-bcc1-d78e271f7a53.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the spacing introduced by the `block` variable will make the two right images taller in height than the left big image. No matter what ratios I am using, they never end up aligning perfectly. Even if I found a perfect ratio, is it correct that the `rem` used by `block` for spacing might screw up my layout on different devices anyway?\r\n\r\nThe code I use is the following:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"columns\">\r\n    <div class=\"column is-two-thirds\">\r\n        <div class=\"block\">\r\n            <div class=\"card\">\r\n                <div class=\"card-image\">\r\n                    <figure class=\"image is-3by2\">\r\n                        <a href=\"<%= it.image_1_full %>\">\r\n                            <img src=\"<%= it.image_1_full %>\" alt=\"Placeholder image\">\r\n                        </a>\r\n                    </figure>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"column\">\r\n        <div class=\"block\">\r\n            <div class=\"card\">\r\n                <div class=\"card-image\">\r\n                    <figure class=\"image is-3by2\">\r\n                        <a href=\"<%= it.image_2_full %>\">\r\n                            <img src=\"<%= it.image_2_thumb %>\" alt=\"Placeholder image\">\r\n                        </a>\r\n                    </figure>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        \r\n        <div class=\"card\">\r\n            <div class=\"card-image\">\r\n                <figure class=\"image is-3by2\">\r\n                    <a href=\"<%= it.image_3_full %>\">\r\n                        <img src=\"<%= it.image_3_thumb %>\" alt=\"Placeholder image\">\r\n                    </a>\r\n                </figure>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy questions: \r\n1. Is this problem solvable, when using `block` with `rem` as spacing?\r\n2. How can I create custom ratios to perfectly compensate for the spacing in between and is there a way to calculate these ratios?\r\n3. What would the smart approach be?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nSee above\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nFind image ratios with normal `block` spacing, which do not create offsets like in the images above\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe `block` spacing introduces an offset, which looks bad\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3444","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Tough question regarding image ratios and blocks for spacing\" (#3444)"},{"Id":"1049024507","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-11-10T08:04:29","Actor":"jcantrel","Number":"3443","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bulma Fixed Position Elements","State":"closed","Body":"This is about Bulma.\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework** \r\nI'm using Bulma **version** [0.9.2] \r\nMy **browser** is: Chrome\r\nI am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI have created a fixed position button for moving to the top, using manual CSS.

This is also visible in the [docs](https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/table/).\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a simple table\r\n```html\r\n<table class=\"table is-hoverable\">\r\n  <thead>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <th>One</th>\r\n      <th>Two</th>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </thead>\r\n\r\n  <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>Three</td>\r\n      <td>Four</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>Five</td>\r\n      <td>Six</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>Seven</td>\r\n      <td>Eight</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>Nine</td>\r\n      <td>Ten</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td>Eleven</td>\r\n      <td>Twelve</td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n```\r\n2. Add `is-hoverable` to the `table` element\r\n3. Try hovering the mouse over a row\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nA slight color change on each `tr` element on hover.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nNo color change!\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3430","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"'is-hoverable' seems to be broken on tables\" (#3430)"},{"Id":"1028646392","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-10-18T05:27:35","Actor":"Galaxy-Coding","Number":"3429","RawContent":null,"Title":"Multiple css files","State":"open","Body":"Bulma is currently only [one CSS file](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/master/css/bulma.css). It would be way more useful if there were multiple CSS files, meaning there is one file for each component,  element, or concept just like the [SASS files](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/tree/master/sass). If this was also a thing for CSS we could just import **only** the CDN files we need instead of one big CSS file. When I use my Bulma CSS on [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), I am told that there is lots of unused CSS. This makes the website way slower. The best solution would be those multiple CSS files. I know this is already a thing for SASS, but it is complicated to set up, especially for static site generators. I would strongly appreciate it if someone made this change possible. Please let me know what you think of this suggestion, and how likely it is to be implemented. I hope you understand my problem and how to fix it.

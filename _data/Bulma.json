While this works out fine, it seems to collide with a potential `is-col-span-*`, where the span wins.\r\nIn my opinion the column definition should overrule the span definition, especially as I have no option to redefine the span on mobile.\r\n\r\n<!-- Description of the bug, enhancement, or question -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\nThe example in the description\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"fixed-grid has-1-cols has-2-cols-tabled\">\r\n  <div class=\"grid\">\r\n    <div class=\"cell\">Cell 1</div>\r\n    <div class=\"cell is-col-span-2\">Cell 2</div>\r\n    <div class=\"cell\">Cell 3</div>\r\n    <div class=\"cell\">Cell 4</div>\r\n    <div class=\"cell\">Cell 5</div>\r\n    <div class=\"cell\">Cell 6</div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nA simplified example:\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"fixed-grid has-1-cols\">\r\n  <div class=\"grid\">\r\n    <div class=\"cell\">Cell 1</div>\r\n    <div class=\"cell is-col-span-2\">Cell 2</div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nIf I use `has-1-cols` on a fixed grid, it should only display 1 column, regardless of cell configuration.\r\n\r\n(`has-1-cols` overrules `is-col-span-2`)\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nBy using `has-col-span-2` I force a 2 column grid, ignoring the actual fixed-grid configuration.\r\n\r\n( `is-col-span-2` overrules `has-1-cols`)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Suggestion\r\n\r\nI fix it by overriding the `grid-column-end` value like this (not sure if there are any side effects):\r\n```\r\ngrid-column-end: span min(var(--bulma-grid-column-count), var(--bulma-grid-cell-column-span));\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3832","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"More columns in grid than expected when using col-span\" (#3832)"},{"Id":"2320853094","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-28T11:43:58","Actor":"dseebacher","Number":"3831","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix swapped paragraphs in grid-cells doc","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n<!-- DO NOT REBUILD THE CSS OUTPUT IN YOUR PR -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is a documentation fix.\r\n<!-- New feature?

However, there are problems when using some of the **typography** and **spacing** helper classes (E.g., is-size-\\*, py-\\*) which are not working when the \"bulma-\" prefix is added.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nWhen the following title is created, the text size (bulma-is-size-\\*) and padding (bulma-py-5-\\*) helpers has no effect.\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"bulma-title bulma-has-text-primary bulma-is-size-1 bulma-py-5\">Bulma</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt only works after removing the prefix from those helper classes\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"bulma-title bulma-has-text-primary is-size-1 py-5\">Bulma</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nFor consistency, I would love the ability to use the spacing and size classes also with prefix. Thanks!\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3805","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Some of the helper classes are missing prefix in the pre-built alternative of \"Prefixed\" version \" (#3805)"},{"Id":"2267792265","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-04-28T20:08:35","Actor":"alycklama","Number":"3804","RawContent":null,"Title":"How do I override the colors in the dark theme?","State":"open","Body":"Is it possible to override the colors in the dark theme? I've tried so many things, and I have yet to find a working or maintainable solution.\r\n\r\nNaively, I tried to use the following, but it didn't work:\r\n```scss\r\n@include cv.system-theme($name: \"dark\") {\r\n  $primary: hsl(11, 100%, 41%);\r\n\r\n  @include cv.register-hsl(\"shadow\", white);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I tried the code below, which seems to work fine, however, it doesn't seem to work well with contrasting colours. The `has-text-primary-invert` has the exact same color in the dark theme if the primary color of the light theme is set to `#fff`. I'm not entirely sure how the dark theme isn't independent of the light theme. I guess because I'm changing a single color and I'm not using `generate-on-scheme-colors`?\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1161\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/assets/6285202/9541463f-5588-4a5d-816f-72c47174e052\">\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@include cv.system-theme($name: \"dark\") {\r\n  --bulma-primary: hsl(130, 50, 45);\r\n  --bulma-primary-h: 130deg;\r\n  --bulma-primary-s: 50%;\r\n  --bulma-primary-l: 45%;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI had a look in the code base to see how the dark theme is constructed. There I noticed the same color palette is used as for the light theme. I copied all the code below and just changed the primary value. However, this doesn't seem to work at all.\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n$dark-colors: fn.mergeColorMaps(\r\n  (\r\n    \"primary\": #ff0000,\r\n  ),\r\n  dv.$custom-colors\r\n) !default;\r\n\r\n@include cv.system-theme($name: \"dark\") {\r\n  @each $name, $color in $dark-colors {\r\n    $base: $color;\r\n\r\n    @if type-of($color == \"list\") {\r\n      $base: list.nth($color, 1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @include cv.generate-on-scheme-colors($name, $base, $scheme-main);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @include cv.register-vars(\r\n    (\r\n      \"scheme-brightness\": \"dark\",\r\n    )\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  @include cv.register-hsl(\"shadow\", white);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny idea how this is supposed to work idiomatically?

With current Bulma (0.8.2) it is not possible to create nested dropdown components due to the way Bulma decides when to show/hide dropdown content. Compiled selector is `.dropdown.is-active .dropdown-menu, .dropdown.is-hoverable:hover .dropdown-menu`, which means that a `.dropdown-menu` that has a parent `.dropdown.is-active` (or hover, I'm using `is-active` version, so I will stick with that in description for clarity) immediately gets shown, even if it is not its designated `.dropdown` element. I belive that a proper selector for determining whether dropdown is displayed or not should be `.dropdown.is-active > .dropdown-menu` (notice the direct child selector change). This simple fix allows to nest dropdowns without any issues, and (as far as I can see) does not break any current behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI created a [demo](https://codepen.io/sebastian-bartkowiak/pen/BaoMjWj) showing current behaviour - please notice how nested dropdown does not have `.is-active` class.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNested dropdown hidden.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nNested dropdown shown.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/2963","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Nested dropdowns always shown\" (#2963)"},{"Id":"620599000","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-20T16:45:15","Actor":"ahmed-alamer","Number":"2959","RawContent":null,"Title":"Full Height Column","State":"closed","Body":"How do I make a column full width?

I believe this is a bug, but I may incorrect or it may be easier to fix as documentation.\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\nI'm using Bulma **version** [0.9.4]\r\nMy **browser** is: Google Chrome Version `113.0.5672.92 (Official Build) (arm64)`\r\nI am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen inline elements are used as direct children of a `card-header-title`, they will disrupt the inline flow of text and erase any adjoining whitespace. There are workaround, but if the behavior is expected, it could use better documentation.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"211\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-22 at 2 31 27 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/assets/35267/435aae7d-2219-4ec7-9c0b-272ff1e81d4c\">\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Have a card with a title that includes html similar to the following:\r\n```\r\n<h3 class=\"card-header-title\">Item <mark>match</mark>ing search</h3>\r\n```\r\n2. For example, see this [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/xwq92Lun/1/)\r\n3. Observe the resulting whitespace\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThere should be a single space between `Item` and `matching`:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"231\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-22 at 2 31 38 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/assets/35267/367cf2dc-f962-4258-85cf-54fdd1595f13\">\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe word \"Item\" runs right into \"matching\" with no whitespace:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"211\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-22 at 2 31 27 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/assets/35267/435aae7d-2219-4ec7-9c0b-272ff1e81d4c\">\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n1. One workaround is to wrap the contents of `card-header-title` in a separate element -- so that its children do not automatically become flex items. This causes extra markup, and is not mentioned anywhere in the documentation as a necessary step:\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"card-header-title\"><h3>Item <mark>match</mark>ing search</h3></div>\r\n```\r\n2. Another workaround is to manually apply a `display: block` to `card-header-title`. e.g:\r\n```\r\n<h3 class=\"card-header-title\" style=\"display:block;\">Item <mark>match</mark>ing search</h3>\r\n```\r\n### Thoughts on causes (& potential fixes)\r\n\r\n1. This behavior occurs because of `display:flex` on `card-header title` ([link to code](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/d2d3c3dd7f2e4076b84e63efc998252851913a72/sass/components/card.sass#L49)). One way to fix it would be to simply remove that line (and also `align-items: center` which would no longer be valid. However, this would break the ability to add `.is-centered` as mentioned in the [`0.5.3` changelog](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/d2d3c3dd7f2e4076b84e63efc998252851913a72/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L1085).\r\n2. If the expectation is that `card-header-title` is a _container for other elements that contain text_ and is not expected to contain text directly, the documentation should be updated to reflect this expectation. For example, the [Card component docs](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/d2d3c3dd7f2e4076b84e63efc998252851913a72/docs/cyp/components/card.html#L8) could replace their `<p class=\"card-header-title\">Card header</p>` example with `<div class=\"card-header-title\"><p>Card header</p></div>`\r\n\r\n\r\nI am happy to submit a PR for either approach, but would like guidance (especially since solution # 1 would break existing functionality and need a bit more work to be less disruptive).\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3650","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"card-header-title: Inline html elements \"swallow\" adjoining whitespace.\" (#3650)"},{"Id":"1714972544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-18T04:44:00","Actor":"i4pg","Number":"3649","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix: typo in navbar doc","State":"closed","Body":"This is a documentation fix.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nfix typo on navbar components documentation\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nNo tradeoffs\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n<!-- BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR PR, MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS: -->\r\n<!-- 1.

The main downside of using this custom division function, is that it uses multiple loops that severely slow down build speeds on the final app.\r\n\r\nThis has been reported previously at #3604, and was been investigated in a separate thread.\r\n\r\nThis pull request replaces the custom `divide` function logic with the built-in sass `math.div` function. This change results in 20x quicker build times with nuxt + vite.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nBecause node-sass has not been updated, there is no support for the `math.div` function. To work around this issue, I've replaced all references with `node-sass` to the `sass` npm package. The functionality is nearly identical, and there should be no modification necessary to any workflows.\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nI have built both the main `css` files along with the `rtl-css` files. Both returned perfect results, and no errors were displayed during building.\r\n\r\n### Changelog updated?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks! -->\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/3641","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Replace custom divide function with sass built-in math.div.\" (#3641)"},{"Id":"1683884770","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-25T21:16:04","Actor":"dependabot[bot]","Number":"3640","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump yaml from 2.2.1 to 2.2.2 in /docs","State":"open","Body":"Bumps [yaml](https://github.com/eemeli/yaml) from 2.2.1 to 2.2.2.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/eemeli/yaml/releases\">yaml's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v2.2.2</h2>\n<p>This patch release includes a fix for an error that could be thrown in <code>parseDocument</code> for degenerate input.

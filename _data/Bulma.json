There are workaround, but if the behavior is expected, it could use better documentation.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"211\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-22 at 2 31 27 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/assets/35267/435aae7d-2219-4ec7-9c0b-272ff1e81d4c\">\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

For example, see this [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/xwq92Lun/1/)\r\n3. Observe the resulting whitespace\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThere should be a single space between `Item` and `matching`:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"231\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-22 at 2 31 38 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/assets/35267/367cf2dc-f962-4258-85cf-54fdd1595f13\">\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe word \"Item\" runs right into \"matching\" with no whitespace:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"211\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-05-22 at 2 31 27 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/assets/35267/435aae7d-2219-4ec7-9c0b-272ff1e81d4c\">\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n1. One workaround is to wrap the contents of `card-header-title` in a separate element -- so that its children do not automatically become flex items. This causes extra markup, and is not mentioned anywhere in the documentation as a necessary step:\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"card-header-title\"><h3>Item <mark>match</mark>ing search</h3></div>\r\n```\r\n2. Another workaround is to manually apply a `display: block` to `card-header-title`. e.g:\r\n```\r\n<h3 class=\"card-header-title\" style=\"display:block;\">Item <mark>match</mark>ing search</h3>\r\n```\r\n### Thoughts on causes (& potential fixes)\r\n\r\n1. This behavior occurs because of `display:flex` on `card-header title` ([link to code](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/d2d3c3dd7f2e4076b84e63efc998252851913a72/sass/components/card.sass#L49)). One way to fix it would be to simply remove that line (and also `align-items: center` which would no longer be valid. However, this would break the ability to add `.is-centered` as mentioned in the [`0.5.3` changelog](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/d2d3c3dd7f2e4076b84e63efc998252851913a72/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L1085).\r\n2. If the expectation is that `card-header-title` is a _container for other elements that contain text_ and is not expected to contain text directly, the documentation should be updated to reflect this expectation. For example, the [Card component docs](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/d2d3c3dd7f2e4076b84e63efc998252851913a72/docs/cyp/components/card.html#L8) could replace their `<p class=\"card-header-title\">Card header</p>` example with `<div class=\"card-header-title\"><p>Card header</p></div>`\r\n\r\n\r\nI am happy to submit a PR for either approach, but would like guidance (especially since solution # 1 would break existing functionality and need a bit more work to be less disruptive).\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3650","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"card-header-title: Inline html elements \"swallow\" adjoining whitespace.\" (#3650)"},{"Id":"1714972544","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-05-18T04:44:00","Actor":"i4pg","Number":"3649","RawContent":null,"Title":"fix: typo in navbar doc","State":"closed","Body":"This is a documentation fix.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nfix typo on navbar components documentation\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nNo tradeoffs\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n<!-- BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR PR, MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THESE STEPS: -->\r\n<!-- 1.

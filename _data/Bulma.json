Thus, it seems as if I have to compile the whole Front-End app for each language separately and then run several instances, one for each language, which seems a bit strange. But I am new to SASS and still a Bulma beginner, so maybe there is a more practical approach?\r\n\r\nIdeally a user would just use a dropdown menu for selecting his/her language and JavaScript and Bulma are doing their magic behind the scenes.

In the documentation, gaps can be set on mobile display sizes using a `-mobile` helper: `columns is-variable is-1-mobile`. However on mobile, columns are stacked by default. So in the [example in the documentation](https://bulma.io/documentation/columns/gap/#breakpoint-based-column-gaps), `is-1-mobile` does nothing to change the layout. To reproduce, change that class to `is-3-mobile` and see how it has no effect on the layout. \r\n\r\nMy intent is that on mobile there is a vertical gap between each column but it seems like Bulma does not offer such functionality. At all sizes, the `--columnGap` is set on the left and right padding but not top and bottom. \r\n```\r\npadding-left: var(--columnGap);\r\npadding-right: var(--columnGap);\r\n```\r\n\r\nEither the documentation should clarify that `is-n-mobile` does nothing without `is-mobile`, or such functionality to adjust vertical gap at mobile viewport should be introduced. \r\n\r\nI can file a PR if such a feature makes sense.

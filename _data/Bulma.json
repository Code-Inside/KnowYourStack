There should be no whitespace underneath the .hero-foot.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe .columns element is wider than the page (it appears to be always by 24px). This also causes display issues on mobile because when the page gets shrunk down to accommodate this larger-than-the-screen element it squashes the .hero-foot element. There's also some whitespace underneath the .hero-foot.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2020-06-29 at 15 51 17](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52198062/86021477-05aafb00-ba21-11ea-80f5-7cb3d86a2b8b.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3023","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \".columns exceeds width of the page in a .hero-foot and adds whitespace at bottom of page\" (#3023)"},{"Id":"647283374","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-29T11:24:40","Actor":"svdHero","Number":"3022","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add width weights for table columns when using the table class","State":"open","Body":"This is a feature request for Bulma.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen I use a `table` with many columns inside a `table-container`, the line breaks in the table cells' content can be really ugly.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if one could add weights to the columns in order to have more control over the width of a column.\r\nMaybe something similar as with the `column` class, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"container\">\r\n    <div class=\"table-container\">\r\n        <table class=\"table is-narrow is-bordered is-striped is-hoverable is-fullwidth\">\r\n            <thead>\r\n                <tr>\r\n                    <th class=\"is-half\">Foo</th>\r\n                    <th class=\"is-one-quarter\">Bar</th>\r\n                    <th class=\"is-one-quarter\">Umu</th>\r\n                </tr>\r\n            </thead>\r\n            <tbody>\r\n                ...\r\n            </tbody>\r\n        </table>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3022","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add width weights for table columns when using the table class\" (#3022)"},{"Id":"646893729","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-28T11:19:14","Actor":"codeyash","Number":"3021","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove weight from has-text-weight-light and similar ones","State":"closed","Body":"\r\nhas-text-weight-light | Transforms text weight to light\r\n-- | --\r\nhas-text-weight-normal | Transforms text weight to normal\r\nhas-text-weight-medium | Transforms text weight to medium\r\nhas-text-weight-semibold | Transforms text weight to semi-bold\r\nhas-text-weight-bold | Transforms text weight to bold\r\n\r\nSounds little long\r\n\r\nhas-text-bold is enough\r\n\r\nRemove weight from all :)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3021","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Remove weight from has-text-weight-light and similar ones\" (#3021)"},{"Id":"646685668","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-27T13:46:06","Actor":"ambrt","Number":"3020","RawContent":null,"Title":"ma and pa - margin and padding for all sides","State":"open","Body":"**Feature proposal**\r\n\r\nAlong m* and p* helpers there could be all sides helpers.

Using the float method caused the button to not be taken into account in the sections height, so it sat on top of the bottom padding of the section, and required additional styling to allow for space below it to avoid the button being at the bottom of the screen.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have a simple class to create a flex container and the align or justify items inside with modifiers, something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"is-flex is-justified-end\">\r\n      <button class=\"button\">Save Changes</button>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could be accomplished using `.columns` but seems a bit too much work having to offset columns to align them","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3008","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Flexbox utilities and helper classes to create flex elements\" (#3008)"},{"Id":"642713370","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-22T03:03:44","Actor":"gahia","Number":"3007","RawContent":null,"Title":"Horizontal field responsiveness ","State":"open","Body":"This is about **Bulma**.\r\nThis is **Feature**.\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\nI'm using Bulma **version** [0.9.0]\r\nMy **browser** is: Firefox 77.0.1 (64-bit)\r\nI am almost sure this issue is **not a duplicate**, I didn't found an issue or PR about this.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis is about having responsiveness classes for horizontal fields in order to define when a field becomes horizontal.\r\n\r\nI think it could be useful to have it ready made in Bulma Framework.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAn .is-desktop class would make the field become horizontal only after 1024px (desktop)... and the same idea for all other breakpoints.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nAt this moment, an .is-horizontal field become horizontal after 769px (tablet).\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3007","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Horizontal field responsiveness \" (#3007)"},{"Id":"642562591","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-21T13:21:36","Actor":"tontonsb","Number":"3006","RawContent":null,"Title":"Content overflows it's tile in the new Chrome","State":"open","Body":"### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\nMy **browser** is: Chrome 83.0.4103.106\r\nI am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**?

sure this issue is **not a duplicate**? -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen I was using Bulma 0.9.4 I could customise colors using Bulma's predefined colours for example something like this:\r\n`$body-background-color: $grey`\r\n\r\nWith Bulma 1.0.1 I have code like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@use \"../bulma-1.0.1/sass/utilities\" with (\r\n    $body-background-color: $grey\r\n);\r\n```\r\nbut when I compile it with SASS I get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Undefined variable.\r\n ╷\r\n2│     $body-background-color: $grey\r\n │                             ^^^^^\r\nmake: *** [scss] Error 65\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can set `$body-background-color` to a literal color, or a Bulma pre-defined CSS variable but not a pre-defined SASS variable.\r\n\r\nI know I probably do not understand how this works now in the new version and need some help to understand and how to do thi now.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nUse the following code below in scss file and compile with sass:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@use \"bulma/sass/utilities\" with (\r\n    $body-background-color: $grey\r\n);\r\n```\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\n`$grey` should be available when I compile and not throw an error.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nwhen I compile it with SASS I get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Undefined variable.\r\n ╷\r\n2│     $body-background-color:

Bulma **CSS framework** (and potentially missing Bulma **Docs**).\r\nI'm using Bulma **version** 1.0.0\r\nMy **browser** is: Firefox 127.0.1\r\nThis is may be a **Sass** issue: I'm using version 1.76.0\r\nI am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe are customizing the burger menu to use the checkbox CSS-only, no JavaScript approach (which is cool but the details are not important here).  Lacking any way (that i can tell) to override the burger mixin without also overriding the entire navbar.scss file, we are simply adding some custom CSS below our simple Bulma import— a situation that must come up all the time, but is not in the documentation yet that i found.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that if we use a CSS variable that should have been defined by Bulma, we are told that it is not— and if we use the Bulma variable it converts itself to a CSS variable that reports it is not defined!\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nHere is the code:\r\n\r\n```sass\r\n$custom-green: #2E5B60;\r\n\r\n@use \"../../../node_modules/bulma/sass\" as bulma with (\r\n  $primary: $custom-green\r\n);\r\n\r\n.menu-btn {\r\n  .navicon {\r\n    background: bulma.$navbar-burger-color;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTry to use the navbar burger color as either a Sass variable *or* a CSS variable.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI have access to the navbar burger color (and any other Bulma Sass variable *or* Bulma CSS variable) in my custom code.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\n--bulma-navbar-burger-color: var(--bulma-navbar-item-color);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBrowser inspector reports: `--bulma-navbar-item-color is not set`\r\n\r\nLooking at this more maybe this is a bug specific to this one variable, but documentation on how this all would be expected to work would help identify when behavior is a one-off specific bug (if that is the case here).","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3852","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"How to use Bulma CSS variables in custom CSS?\" (#3852)"},{"Id":"2385601044","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-07-02T08:30:20","Actor":"hereticjsorg","Number":"3851","RawContent":null,"Title":"Cannot build using postcss-csso","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma**.\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**.

This is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version 1.77.6.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI'm using Webpack to build my application (Heretic Web Framework) which is using Bulma (https://hereticjs.org/, https://demo.hereticjs.org/).

My gut feel says the icons appearing as circles would be the expected / preferred result when adding the `is-rounded` modifier.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd an extra selector to move the extra padding case to happen only in the cases where a single icon isn't the sole child of the button.\r\n\r\nThis means that circular icon buttons can now  be created, but adding any other content to the button still results in the exact same proportions as before.\r\n\r\nAs maybe an optional thing I put the `:has()` selector behind behind an `@supports` rule to more gracefully handle older browsers that don't support it (falling back to the same logic as before). But it has recently gained good browser support too and I see some instances of it starting to turn up in Bulma already — so unsure wether the progressive enhancement is necessary!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nAdds a bit more duplicated css having the feature detection in there. But on the flipside browsers drop the whole rule set if `:has()` isn't supported so it feels good to have given the recency of browser support coverage.\r\n\r\nAdds a bit more complexity to the button ruleset overall.\r\n\r\nI don't see too many other drawbacks unless people are currently relying on the oval shaped icon buttons — seems unlikely but it could be a thing?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nChecked all existing buttons in the docs locally, and added the `is-rounded` modifier to as many variations as I could find or think of, making sure that anything more than a single icon as the only child still results in the same padding behaviour as before.\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"776\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/assets/616368/85103d35-37ac-4375-a6c8-92cf0d25cb17\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"768\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/assets/616368/bbfa1090-aeb7-4ac2-bcd3-4746dd1e4c7a\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changelog updated?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/3839","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix proportions of icon only rounded buttons to be perfect circles\" (#3839)"},{"Id":"2346209155","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-11T14:15:36","Actor":"jgthms","Number":"3838","RawContent":null,"Title":"Shop","State":"closed","Body":"Launching the Bulma Shop.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/3838","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Shop\" (#3838)"},{"Id":"2342159190","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-09T10:53:48","Actor":"phil-w","Number":"3836","RawContent":null,"Title":"Sass file bulma/sass/base doesn't include skeleton","State":"open","Body":"This is about Bulma .\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\nIncluding bulma/sass/base grabs you the contents of the _index file in that directory, but omits skeleton.\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n-  This is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **Docs** -->\r\n- I'm using Bulma **version** 1.0.0\r\n<!-- My **browser** is: -->\r\n<!-- This is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- I am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**? -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nMissing SASS include in _index file for base.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n`@forward \"bulma/sass/base\";` should be sufficient.\r\n\r\nEither skeleton should live somewhere else, or it should be included as per other base components. \r\nThis is **not** what I expected to need:\r\n~~~\r\n@forward \"bulma/sass/base\";\r\n@forward \"bulma/sass/base/skeleton\";\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nSkeleton is missed out of the _index include so you need to explicitly add it as above.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3836","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Sass file bulma/sass/base doesn't include skeleton\" (#3836)"},{"Id":"2331462133","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-03T15:31:37","Actor":"renannprado","Number":"3835","RawContent":null,"Title":"[meta] Enable discussions","State":"open","Body":"hey @jgthms thanks for the library.

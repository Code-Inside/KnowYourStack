Thus when reading the docs in Dark Mode, both columns will show Dark Mode colors.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n1. Browse here https://bulma.io/documentation/features/dark-mode/\r\n2. Ensure you are in Light Mode\r\n3. Scroll down to \"Updating the lightness\" and confirm that the Light Mode has bright colors at the top and is inverted from Dark Mode\r\n4.

My gut feel says the icons appearing as circles would be the expected / preferred result when adding the `is-rounded` modifier.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd an extra selector to move the extra padding case to happen only in the cases where a single icon isn't the sole child of the button.\r\n\r\nThis means that circular icon buttons can now  be created, but adding any other content to the button still results in the exact same proportions as before.\r\n\r\nAs maybe an optional thing I put the `:has()` selector behind behind an `@supports` rule to more gracefully handle older browsers that don't support it (falling back to the same logic as before). But it has recently gained good browser support too and I see some instances of it starting to turn up in Bulma already â€”Â so unsure wether the progressive enhancement is necessary!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\nAdds a bit more duplicated css having the feature detection in there. But on the flipside browsers drop the whole rule set if `:has()` isn't supported so it feels good to have given the recency of browser support coverage.\r\n\r\nAdds a bit more complexity to the button ruleset overall.\r\n\r\nI don't see too many other drawbacks unless people are currently relying on the oval shaped icon buttons â€”Â seems unlikely but it could be a thing?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing Done\r\n\r\nChecked all existing buttons in the docs locally, and added the `is-rounded` modifier to as many variations as I could find or think of, making sure that anything more than a single icon as the only child still results in the same padding behaviour as before.\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"776\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/assets/616368/85103d35-37ac-4375-a6c8-92cf0d25cb17\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"768\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/assets/616368/bbfa1090-aeb7-4ac2-bcd3-4746dd1e4c7a\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changelog updated?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/3839","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fix proportions of icon only rounded buttons to be perfect circles\" (#3839)"},{"Id":"2346209155","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-11T14:15:36","Actor":"jgthms","Number":"3838","RawContent":null,"Title":"Shop","State":"closed","Body":"Launching the Bulma Shop.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/pull/3838","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Shop\" (#3838)"},{"Id":"2345312143","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-06-11T03:40:52","Actor":"bagedevimo","Number":"3837","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix bulma color brightness","State":"open","Body":"This is a **bugfix**.\r\n\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n\r\nPreviously, the bulmaColorBrightness function was understating the value of the blue channel when estimating brightness for a specific colour, due to a missing set of brackets.

I haven't been able to find it anywhere\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI'm using the select dropdown in a form and when I use the `is-danger` class, it doesn't update the dropdown. \r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nDocs:\r\n1. Go to https://bulma.io/documentation/form/select/ on chrome and firefox. \r\n2. Look at the Colors section\r\n3. Observe none of the dropdowns reflect the code to the right.\r\n\r\nNote: Curiously I found that this 3rd party website does reflect the code in its site: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/bulma/bulma_form_select.htm\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n\r\nThis is the code I'm using:\r\n\r\n    <div class=\"field\">\r\n      <label class=\"label\">Select Cake Filling</label>\r\n      <div class=\"control\">\r\n        <div class=\"select is-danger has-da\">\r\n          <select [(ngModel)]=\"cakeFilling\">\r\n            <option>Select a Cake Filling</option>\r\n            <option>Vanilla</option>\r\n            <option>Chocolate</option>\r\n          </select>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect when I put the `is-danger` tag in the div class with `select`, it should make the border the red border color. \r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nAdding the tag doesn't seem to change the appearance of the dropdown.\r\n \r\n![Screenshot 2024-05-20 at 12 48 50â€¯AM](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/assets/11866301/50afdc09-03bf-4b74-a640-658bd0a9f30f)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3821","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"is-danger doesn't update select dropdown\" (#3821)"},{"Id":"2304070539","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-05-18T12:36:36","Actor":"xtlc","Number":"3820","RawContent":null,"Title":"Card component ignoring columns?","State":"open","Body":"","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3820","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Card component ignoring columns?\" (#3820)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2024-07-01T03:30:07.8755852Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":384}

Bring up a page containing an instance of the  `select` class which has `<options>`. (For example, https://bulma.io/documentation/form/select/.)\r\n2. Using the browser developer tools, edit one of the `<option>` tags to contain a `selected` attribute, e.g. `<option selected=\"selected\">`.\r\n3. It may be necessary to repeat this a few times, moving the `selected` attribute to different options, before the bug is reproduced.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe option selected in the dropdown display changes to match the `<option>` with the `selected` attribute. (This is the behaviour when the same steps are performed on e.g. https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_select).\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nInitially, the actual behaviour may appear to match the expected behaviour. However, after a few repeats of the above steps, the displayed option selection no longer changes when the `selected` attribute is moved. As a result, the underlying value of the dropdown may become different from the value the user thinks it has.

The described workflow doesn't include running autoprefixer, and the resulting generated bulma.css is different from the official one (I count 11 different properties, mainly related to animation).\r\n\r\nThe docs should either make it clear that autoprefixer is also a dependency, or at least warn that css files produced without it might be different from the official one.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Follow the steps on [this page](https://bulma.io/documentation/customize/with-node-sass/), up to \"To test it out, go in your terminal and run the following command: npm run css-build\".\r\n2. Compare the generated css file with bulma.css\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWith no customization, users expect the files to be the same.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nFiles differ on the following browser-prefixed properties:\r\n\r\n    -webkit-animation: spinAround 500ms infinite linear;\r\n    -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;\r\n    -moz-text-size-adjust: 100%;\r\n    @-webkit-keyframes spinAround {...}\r\n    -webkit-animation-duration: 1.5s;\r\n    -webkit-animation-iteration-count: infinite;\r\n    -webkit-animation-name: moveIndeterminate;\r\n    -webkit-animation-timing-function: linear;\r\n    @-webkit-keyframes moveIndeterminate {...}\r\n    min-height: -webkit-min-content;\r\n    min-height: -moz-min-content;","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3520","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Document dependency on autoprefixer or warn about its usage\" (#3520)"},{"Id":"1228031938","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-05-06T16:22:45","Actor":"petasittek","Number":"3519","RawContent":null,"Title":"Remove useless console.log() from Modal example","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n<!-- DO NOT REBUILD THE CSS OUTPUT IN YOUR PR -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is a **documentation fix**.\r\n<!-- New feature?

This assigns a value to a variable only if that variable isn’t defined or its value is [null](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/values/null). Otherwise, the existing value will be used.\r\n\r\nThis means that both of these variables can **never be** null. If they get set to null outside, `!default` kicks in and overwrites that value.\r\nThis means not only that the null checks are useless, but also that the generation of these classes can't be turned off, which was probably intended.\r\nI found this tweet which claims that an empty list / array works instead, but it creates an error when i try to compile it because at least in the current versions of SASS, an empty list is not equal to null: https://twitter.com/TweetsOfSumit/status/1346502700893155328?s=20&t=ZSeM19qMCyagy71ppkyNpw\r\nAnd even if that was true, it's not documented anywhere.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3507","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"null checks on !default variables are useless because they can't be null\" (#3507)"},{"Id":"1194584883","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-06T13:02:30","Actor":"FunctionDJ","Number":"3506","RawContent":null,"Title":"Allow customization of typography $alignments in SASS","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\nThis is about **Bulma**.\r\n\r\n<!-- Is it about Bulma or about the Docs? -->\r\n<!-- Is it a bug/feature/question or do you need help? -->\r\n<!-- If it's a bug, is it a browser bug? -->\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\nThis is about the Bulma **CSS framework**\r\nI'm using Bulma **version** 0.9.3\r\nThis is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [not relevant]\r\nI am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAllow customization of `sass/helpers/typography.sass` -> `$alignments`.\r\nhttps://github.com/jgthms/bulma/blob/e5ee280b32c2bac94e363013777ff41d1a9ed2dc/sass/helpers/typography.sass#L29\r\nI think it should be as easy as appending `!default` which worked for me but i'm not too sure if it could break something else.","Url":"https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/issues/3506","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Allow customization of typography $alignments in SASS\" (#3506)"},{"Id":"1190137875","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2022-04-01T18:25:50","Actor":"PhoenixIV","Number":"3505","RawContent":null,"Title":"How to know which files can be excluded from building?","State":"open","Body":"<!-- PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Choose one of the following: -->\r\n<!-- Is it about Bulma or about the Docs? -->\r\n<!-- Is it a bug/feature/question or do you need help? -->\r\n<!-- If it's a bug, is it a browser bug? -->\r\n\r\n### Overview of the problem\r\n\r\nThis is about **building Bulma**.\r\nThis is about **the Docs**.\r\nI need help and have a feature suggestion.\r\n\r\n<!-- UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES -->\r\n\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **CSS framework** -->\r\n<!-- This is about the Bulma **Docs** -->\r\n<!-- I'm using Bulma **version** [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- My **browser** is: -->\r\n<!-- This is a **Sass** issue: I'm using version [x.x.x] -->\r\n<!-- I am sure this issue is **not a duplicate**? -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nMy aim is to keep my css as slim as possible.

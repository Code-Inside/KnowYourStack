In the default theme, this is 12-point Segoe UI, foreground color `#003399`.

This will eventually cause a parameter error somewhere in system code. The memory leak is equivalent to what has been loaded. So if I load 1GB of controls; dispose and clear the panel.controls, and load 1GB of controls from the same data source, I will end up with a memory use of 2GB. If I dispose of the panel before recreating it and loading it, the memory leak disappears.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Visual Studio Feedback System on 8/8/2019, 06:22 PM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

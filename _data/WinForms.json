This is most notably needed for custom data objects that implement both `System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComTypes.IDataObject` and `System.Windows.Forms.IDataObject` so that we can get the original object back from the IDataObject* on the 'drop' side\r\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/10918)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/10918","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Refactor DataObject\" (#10918)"},{"Id":"2149027833","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-22T13:36:27","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"10932","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/runtime","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:d9f5b309-084f-43b5-02de-08d8b80548e4)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/runtime\r\n- **Subscription**: d9f5b309-084f-43b5-02de-08d8b80548e4\r\n- **Build**: 20240222.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: February 22, 2024 12:33:43 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: d908f00305588dcf577cd5f9c99ff0464000efdc\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

Because .NET 9 will entirely remove them by default and that I FEEL LIKE being REQUIRED to reference an external nuget package because I set \"Localizable\" to true on a form should not justify a possible security hole in people's applications. That is not acceptable.\r\n\r\n### Did it work in .NET Framework?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Did it work in any of the earlier releases of .NET Core or .NET 5+?\r\n\r\nYes, but BinaryFormatter was deprecated. Now in .NET 9 it will throw an exception on all of it's APIs, and will have the real code in a nuget package. Although best option here is to look into other means of doing the same thing from within the Windows Forms repository. But first I will write code separate from it to test and then copy paste it all into the Windows Forms codebase to be used internally as an implementation detail.\r\n\r\n### Issue description\r\n\r\nBinaryFormatter should be avoided entirely, I know there are other ways of the same thing, perhaps serialize the types as json instead and store said json strings inside of the resx and deserialize that instead at runtime? Would still need code in the designer for that however to migrate the format of those strings in the resx files to json form but it can be done like that as well. Also System.Text.Json is part of the main shared framework and so it should be no problems depending on it.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n- Create a new winforms project in .NET 8 or 9 Preview SDK (dotnet new winforms)\r\n- open the project in Visual Studio 2022\r\n- set the main form to be \"Localizable\".\r\n- Build and get warnings from each item added to the resx file from the designer itself.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/10911","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Consider replacing the use of BinaryFormatter at all in WinForms.\" (#10911)"},{"Id":"2143631446","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-20T19:52:58","Actor":"GCAronChen","Number":"10912","RawContent":null,"Title":"ActiveControl property change To null when control placed in ContainerControl","State":"closed","Body":"### .NET version\r\n\r\n8.0\r\n\r\n### Did it work in .NET Framework?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Did it work in any of the earlier releases of .NET Core or .NET 5+?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Issue description\r\n\r\nWhen placed a control in ActiveMdiChild form, click other control out of current mdi form.\r\n`this.ActiveMdiChild.ActiveControl` will be kept and not change to null.\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/assets/96418485/5ea20a9a-6f5c-44f9-9594-2c58d5fa3111)\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/assets/96418485/c4c08c39-931d-4a26-9335-9d74f2c54798)\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/assets/96418485/6a742303-a815-46a8-b809-ce17d9ceeddb)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut when this control is added in container control, click other control out of current mdi form.\r\n`this.ActiveMdiChild.ActiveControl` will be changed to null.\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/assets/96418485/2caee897-e949-4ea6-a91b-49bd127f68fe)\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/assets/96418485/02bc5ff2-bffe-43b7-94a9-872420122162)\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/assets/96418485/96e4989d-6f5b-4517-adf3-0512e53dda33)\r\n\r\nIs this a bug?\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nUnzip attachment, open \"TestActiveControl.sln\"\r\n\r\n1.

If TreeView is not available, we skip object creation. This fix was implemented based on the exception call stack from the customer.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\nCustomer observes random crashes in their application when dragging TreeView items and clicking on TreeView subtrees with the mouse.\r\nNo workaround is available, \r\n\r\n## Regression? \r\n- Yes from NET7, introduced while enabling accessibility events to TreeNode operations.\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n - Low, we are exiting if accessible object can't be created. AccessibleObject will be created after the node is parented properly.\r\n\r\n## Test \r\n- added unit tests\r\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/10910)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/10910","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/8.0] WinForms TreeView null reference exception 'owningTreeView'\" (#10910)"},{"Id":"2143236827","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-19T22:31:40","Actor":"VaporiZed","Number":"10909","RawContent":null,"Title":"no unicode characters with Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(True)","State":"open","Body":"### .NET version\n\n7.0\n\n### Did it work in .NET Framework?\n\nNo\n\n### Did it work in any of the earlier releases of .NET Core or .NET 5+?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Issue description\n\nThe usage of `Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(True)` leads to a wrong presentation of unicode characters.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- put a button on the form and add a unicode character like a magnifying glass 🔍 to the text of the button\r\n- deactivate the application framework in the project properties\r\n- create a module with an own Sub Main\r\n- set the start object to the module or the Sub Main\r\n- use the following code in the Sub Main:\r\n```\r\nApplication.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(True)\r\nApplication.EnableVisualStyles()\r\nApplication.Run(New YourMainForm)\r\n```\r\n- run the app\r\n\r\nexpectation: the magnifying glass will be shown as it is intended\r\nfact: a placeholder/rectangle is shown instead\r\n\r\n![Result](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/assets/49878115/adc57ffe-55d0-4e04-8bed-5d7cb9258e50)\r\n\r\n[WinFormsNetVB.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/files/14337379/WinFormsNetVB.zip)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/10909","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"no unicode characters with Application.SetCompatibleTextRenderingDefault(True)\" (#10909)"},{"Id":"2142454369","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-19T14:06:19","Actor":"AndersBillLinden","Number":"10908","RawContent":null,"Title":"Input of thousand separators are accepted in NumericUpdown components even if ThousandsSeparator is false","State":"open","Body":"### .NET version\r\n\r\n8.0\r\n\r\n### Did it work in .NET Framework?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Did it work in any of the earlier releases of .NET Core or .NET 5+?\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### Issue description\r\n\r\nWe got a bug report about a user entering a comma in a NumericUpDownExt like: \r\n\r\n2,54651\r\n\r\nand believed the comma was a decimal separator.\r\n\r\nWhat he/she did not anticipate is that the current locale treats comma (,) as thousand separators.\r\nWhat he/she should really input would be a period (.).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the component was blurred, it correctly changed its text to\r\n\r\n254651.000\r\n\r\nBut upon investigation, it turned out that ThousandsSeparator was false for the control.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to not accept the input of the thousand separator if those are turned off anyway?\r\n\r\nThat would cease the confusion (which led to the bug report).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nAdd a NumericUpdown in your form.\r\nSet NumericUpDown.Maximum to a value larger than a thousand\r\nBe sure ThousandsSeparator is false.\r\nYou will still be able to enter the thousand separator character.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/10908","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Input of thousand separators are accepted in NumericUpdown components even if ThousandsSeparator is false\" (#10908)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2024-02-23T03:30:26.2390144Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":408}

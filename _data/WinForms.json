It's more correct in this situation to always just update the index and return the current row.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\n- In some situation old behavior can mislead ppl and theoretically lead to bugs. For example lets see at [DataGridViewCell_Displayed_GetWithSharedDataGridViewWithHandle_ReturnsExpected](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/blob/be52b79bfe1553d69118e1a630767f65a8c653c1/src/System.Windows.Forms/tests/UnitTests/System/Windows/Forms/DataGridViewCellTests.cs#L530) test: \r\n  ```cs\r\n  public void DataGridViewCell_Displayed_GetWithSharedDataGridViewWithHandle_ReturnsExpected(bool gridVisible, bool rowHeadersVisible, bool columnHeadersVisible, bool columnVisible)\r\n  {\r\n      using var control = new DataGridView\r\n      {\r\n          Visible = gridVisible,\r\n          RowHeadersVisible = rowHeadersVisible,\r\n          ColumnHeadersVisible = columnHeadersVisible\r\n      };\r\n      using var cellTemplate = new SubDataGridViewCell();\r\n      using var column = new DataGridViewColumn\r\n      {\r\n          CellTemplate = cellTemplate,\r\n          Visible = columnVisible\r\n      };\r\n      control.Columns.Add(column);\r\n      // We create default row with State = DataGridViewElementStates.Visible;\r\n      // After that we have only one such shared row in the collection. And there 2 rows in the collection overall (+ 1 new_row because of AllowUserToAddRows == true).\r\n      control.Rows.Add();\r\n      // Store it. Note that if we put this line after Assert.NotEqual(IntPtr.Zero, control.Handle), with previews implementation test will fail;\r\n      DataGridViewRow row = control.Rows.SharedRow(0);\r\n      // While calling control.Handle we will create a new handle.\r\n      // During this process DataGridView call MakeFirstDisplayedCellCurrentCell(). Where if we have cell to display (gridVisible && columnVisible) we will set it as CurrentCell.\r\n      // Which in turn will lead to unsharing of the raw in any case. See https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/6930#issuecomment-1090213559.\r\n      // So we have 2 ways:\r\n      // 1. gridVisible && columnVisible == false; our row remain shared and therefore invisible.\r\n      // 2. gridVisible && columnVisible == true; our row became unshared and therefore visible. But because this is the only one such row in the collection and Count of all rows = 2,\r\n      // with previous implementation we will clone it and LOST.\r\n      Assert.NotEqual(IntPtr.Zero, control.Handle);\r\n      int invalidatedCallCount = 0;\r\n      control.Invalidated += (sender, e) => invalidatedCallCount++;\r\n      int styleChangedCallCount = 0;\r\n      control.StyleChanged += (sender, e) => styleChangedCallCount++;\r\n      int createdCallCount = 0;\r\n      control.HandleCreated += (sender, e) => createdCallCount++;\r\n  \r\n      DataGridViewCell cell = row.Cells[0];\r\n      // Here 2 our ways:\r\n      // 1. All correct - we have shared and therefore invisible row.\r\n      // 2. control.Rows.SharedRow(0) unshared and therefore visible BUT our stored row (LOST) still shared and therefore invisible :( So test will pass of course.\r\n      // Test must check: Assert.Equal(gridVisible && columnVisible, cell.Displayed); And with new implementation it will work no mater where you put row = control.Rows.SharedRow(0);\r\n      Assert.False(cell.Displayed);\r\n      Assert.True(control.IsHandleCreated);\r\n      Assert.Equal(0, invalidatedCallCount);\r\n      Assert.Equal(0, styleChangedCallCount);\r\n      Assert.Equal(0, createdCallCount);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n   I can put these comments to source if needed.\r\n- We will not lost any rows and they will not end in Freachable queue #6859. Also we will not create a new row in this case. Performance improvement.\r\n- With new implementation we will gain some performance penalty when unsharing rows (see comments in code).\r\n\r\n## Regression? \r\n\r\n- No\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n- Low in current implementation (see comments in code).\r\n\r\n## Test methodology \r\n\r\nExisting tests (with corrections) and manual testing.\r\n\r\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/api/codeflow?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/6957)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/6957","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Fixed unsharing of last shared row in DataGridViewRowCollection.\" (#6957)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2022-04-08T03:30:30.9697214Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":524}

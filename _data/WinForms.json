There are significant resources attached however, including a demo project, control dlls, and video showing the issue.\r\n\r\nEffectively, this worked without any issue in prior versions of Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nVisual Studio 17.5 seemingly introduced a change in how references were handled, where it automatically attempts to add a reference when a control is dragged onto a form.  If the reference is already added however, the control cannot be added and generates an error that the reference is already added to the project.  This then makes the software unuseable as you must delete the reference between each and every new control that you add to the form and the form designer then cannot display the form if the reference is removed...\r\n\r\nCan this please be corrected?  It is a serious issue.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nOpen a form in the designer.\r\n\r\nDrag a 3rd party control to the form. This then adds a reference to the dll to the project.\r\n\r\nTry to add another control from the same 3rd party control library to the form.  This now generates an error that the control library was already added as a reference and refuses to allow you to add the control to the form.\r\n\r\nDelete the reference to the control library.\r\n\r\nDrag a 3rd party control to the form.  This works and again adds a reference to the dll to the project.\r\n\r\nTry to add another control from the same 3rd party control library to the form.  This now again generates an error that the control library was already added as a reference and refuses again to allow you to add the control to the form.\n\n### Diagnostics\n\n```text\nI believe this is caused by a change in the way Visual Studio 17.5 and 17.5.1 attempt to add references automatically when you add a control to a form / project.  If the reference is already added, Visual Studio should not then attempt to add it again and should not generate an error or refuse to allow you to add the control.\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/8780","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Visual Studio 17.5 and 17.5.1 issues with 3rd party Controls\" (#8780)"},{"Id":"1616260064","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-10T21:58:16","Actor":"JeremyKuhne","Number":"8771","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix disabled text label rendering.","State":"closed","Body":"The problem was actually in ControlPaint.DrawStringDisabled that takes an IDeviceContext.

Looking at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/uxguide/winenv-uac, the shield icon used to indicate elevation is required is a **blue and yellow shield** whereas SystemIcons.Shield, despite being recommended for controls whose default action requires elevation, uses a **red, green, blue and yellow shield** icon as you can see in the image below:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43898231/223266711-abfca92a-f9ca-4088-9fda-8f6b72567132.png).\r\nIf we look at some UIs in Windows 11, it uses a blue and yellow shield as expected:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43898231/223267373-e7ffd394-fc78-46e0-9adb-c0b40af3323f.png)\r\n\r\nIt seems that the icon used in System.Drawing.SystemIcons.Shield is actually the older icon from Windows Vista:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43898231/223275305-d07f6cde-edd4-4651-859b-ae7291f572bd.png)\r\nWhereas it seems to have been changed in to the blue and yellow in Windows 7 and above, but the one in System.Drawing.SystemIcons.Shield was never updated:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43898231/223275455-65ffda41-c1c8-45fc-84e4-150f3e11eb45.png)\r\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nShow System.Drawing.SystemIcons.Shield anywhere in a UI.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/8753","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"System.Drawing.SystemIcons.Shield icon is incorrect in Windows 7 and above\" (#8753)"},{"Id":"1618255340","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-10T20:00:30","Actor":"snnz","Number":"8774","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix: Do not use fixed index in the TreeNode.PrevNode if the TreeView is sorted","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Please read CONTRIBUTING.md before submitting a pull request -->\r\n\r\nFixes #8768\r\n\r\nThis corresponds to the following check in `TreeNodeCollection.AddInternal`, that results in the fixed index not being used for node insertion:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (tv is not null && tv.Sorted)\r\n{\r\n    return owner.AddSorted(node);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n## Regression? \r\n\r\n- No\r\n\r\n<!-- Mention language, UI scaling, or anything else that might be relevant -->\r\n\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/api/codeflow?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/8774)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/8774","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix: Do not use fixed index in the TreeNode.PrevNode if the TreeView is sorted\" (#8774)"},{"Id":"1619439869","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-10T19:42:59","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"8778","RawContent":null,"Title":"Localized file check-in by OneLocBuild Task: Build definition ID 164: Build ID 2132587","State":"closed","Body":"This is the pull request automatically created by the OneLocBuild task in the build process to check-in localized files generated based upon translation source files (.lcl files) handed-back from the downstream localization pipeline.

But I want to give voice to the relevant Microsoft teams, that it has become really ugly and frustrating, not being able to use Winforms design with high DPI monitors, (not to mention the unnerving slowness compared to the net framerwork) in fact today who uses a notebook for development has been kicked out, very discriminating and disrespectful towards developers all over the world, who are using Winforms in 80% of cases to develop on Windows platform, it has become impossible to use visual studio in 100% mode, I am on the verge of giving up everything.  I'm sorry to say, but I think Microsoft is not respecting us developers, stopping for a moment to do new things, and last for all the loose ends with Winforms.  It has since net 3.0 that I wait for them to solve, and every holy November I am disappointed, I was hoping that everything would be solved with the net 7. Despite this, with the .net 8 we still don't talk about what to improve with DPI.  Microsoft doesn't just think about MAUI, it also thinks about us at Winforms.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nAny new project \n\n### Diagnostics\n\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/8770","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Developer warning error with 125% DPI\" (#8770)"},{"Id":"1615834332","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-08T19:55:24","Actor":"snnz","Number":"8768","RawContent":null,"Title":"TreeNodeCollection.AddRange works incorrectly for non-empty collection of the sorted TreeView","State":"open","Body":"### .NET version\n\n6.0\n\n### Did it work in .NET Framework?\n\nNo\n\n### Did it work in any of the earlier releases of .NET Core or .NET 5+?\n\nNo\n\n### Issue description\n\nWhen the tree nodes are appended to the non-empty `TreeNodeCollection` owned by the sorted `TreeView` with already created underlying window, the resulting order of items in the actual window does not match the one in the collection (which is correct).\r\n\r\nThe cause is how method `TreeNode.PrevNode` works: when called from within `TreeNodeCollection.AddRange` of non-empty collection, it always uses fixed index as the position of the previous node, assuming the normal backward insertion of the nodes in the unsorted tree. Yet in case of the sorted `TreeView`, insertions are made at various positions according to a sort order.\r\n\r\nThere obviously should be a check for the sorted state of the tree in `TreeNode.PrevNode` to avoid this.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```\r\nnamespace TreeViewTest\r\n{\r\n  internal static class Program\r\n  {\r\n    [STAThread]\r\n    static void Main()\r\n    {\r\n      ApplicationConfiguration.Initialize();\r\n\r\n      var treeView = new TreeView();\r\n      treeView.Nodes.Add(new TreeNode(\"2\"));\r\n      treeView.Sort();\r\n\r\n      var form = new Form();\r\n      form.Controls.Add(treeView);\r\n      form.Load += (sender, e) => treeView.Nodes.AddRange(new TreeNode[] {\r\n        new TreeNode(\"3\"),\r\n        new TreeNode(\"5\"),\r\n        new TreeNode(\"1\"),\r\n        new TreeNode(\"4\")\r\n      });\r\n      Application.Run(form);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis results in:\r\n![Clipboard01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20656895/223826227-6cf6d1aa-3605-4e39-98a8-65116d5db21a.png)\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/8768","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"TreeNodeCollection.AddRange works incorrectly for non-empty collection of the sorted TreeView\" (#8768)"},{"Id":"1613402178","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-08T19:01:28","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"8756","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:b9a1a4bb-2302-4987-3b3d-08d8b8050dda)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: b9a1a4bb-2302-4987-3b3d-08d8b8050dda\r\n- **Build**: 20230306.4\r\n- **Date Produced**: March 6, 2023 11:09:56 PM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: e4e5e16cf38c950ed835f8b223ebfdeca3e112aa\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

The problem with the constant value is that if application's default font is changed then the DefaultItemHeight will lose relevance.\r\n\r\nAs being explained in the DotNet Issue **[Define a pattern for default values that used to be constants proportional to the default system font](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/8599)** this leeds to extra code being generated for the `ListBox` control at the runtime: the generated code for ListBox had extra code for the ListBox .ItemHeight property.  And the generated property has value was not consistent with the old constant value.\r\n\r\n### Suggestion\r\nUse Control.DefaultFont.Height value as the default for the ItemHeight property.\r\n\r\n1. remove the default value attribute from ItemHeight property;\r\n2. make DefaultItemHeight` constant obsolete;\r\n3. set the default ItemHeight value to the value of the static property `Control.DefaultFont.Height` (thus the ListBox.ItemHeight will be dependent on the height of the Application's Default Font);\r\n4. change `ResetItemHeight` and add `ShouldSerializeItemHeight` methods that compare actual value against the dynamic runtime default.\r\n\r\n### This is a breaking change\r\n\r\nPer https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/docs/coding-guidelines/breaking-change-rules.md#attributes. We make one attribute obsolete and we change the value of an attribute that is observable.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/8751","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[API Proposal]: Define a pattern for default values that used to be constants proportional to the default system font.\" (#8751)"},{"Id":"1610718346","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-06T05:53:31","Actor":"runfoapp[bot]","Number":"8750","RawContent":null,"Title":"Flaky test: application_defaultfont_returns_defaultfont_ifnotscaled","State":"open","Body":"<!-- runfo report start -->\r\nRunfo Tracking Issue: [Flaky test: application_defaultfont_returns_defaultfont_ifnotscaled](https://runfo.azurewebsites.net/tracking/issue/480)\r\n|Build|Definition|Kind|Run Name|\r\n|---|---|---|---|\r\n|[193390](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng-public/public/_build/results?buildId=193390)|[dotnet-winforms CI](https://dnceng-public.visualstudio.com/public/_build?definitionId=76)|[PR 8741](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/8741)|Windows_arm64-xunit|\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuild Result Summary\r\n|Day Hit Count|Week Hit Count|Month Hit Count|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|0|1|1|\r\n\r\n<!-- runfo report end -->\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/8750","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Flaky test: application_defaultfont_returns_defaultfont_ifnotscaled\" (#8750)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2023-03-11T03:30:33.1404976Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":595}

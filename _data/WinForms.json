This will eventually cause a parameter error somewhere in system code. The memory leak is equivalent to what has been loaded. So if I load 1GB of controls; dispose and clear the panel.controls, and load 1GB of controls from the same data source, I will end up with a memory use of 2GB. If I dispose of the panel before recreating it and loading it, the memory leak disappears.\n\n---\n### Original Comments\n\n#### Visual Studio Feedback System on 8/8/2019, 06:22 PM: \n\n<p>We have directed your feedback to the appropriate engineering team for further evaluation.

Initialization of SystemEvents can happen directly in a test or indirectly by usage of WinForms API. If the first usage happens on a UI test (STA) then SystemEvents will bind to that thread. If this is a test thread which gets terminated earily this can lead to deadlocks in the CI framework (dotnet/winforms#3254)\r\n* Some applications are using a separate UI thread for the initial splash screen during application startup. This UI thread is likely to terminate early, if SystemEvents were initialized on that thread they would stop working.\r\n* Some applications use multiple UI threads to implement responsive progress/notification dialogs when the main application thread is busy and work cannot be easily moved off-thread. If such a dialog shows up early (e.g. progress dialog for some update during application startup) SystemEvents may be initialized on a secondary thread that could be terminated early.\r\n* There apparently have been [Watson reports](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/3254#issuecomment-628936999) indicating deadlocking STA threads and/or threads that stop pumping messages.\r\n\r\n### Regression?\r\nNo\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/3317","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"SystemEvents deadlock if UI thread shuts down early\" (#3317)"},{"Id":"621831834","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-20T14:57:32","Actor":"cadilhac","Number":"3316","RawContent":null,"Title":"Winforms designer exception with my custom control","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Read https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/blob/master/Documentation/issue-guide.md -->\r\n\r\n* .NET Core Version: \r\n3.1.300-preview-015135\r\n\r\n* Have you experienced this same bug with .NET Framework?: \r\nNo\r\n\r\n**Problem description:**\r\nI'm the developer of Smart PropertyGrid.Net (VisualHint company) and I am trying to port my component to .net core 3.

changes\r\n\r\n- Call `UiaDisconnectProvider` to explicitly detach UIA providers when a control or form is being disposed. This ensures that clients that leak UIA objects cannot leak them in the target application indefinitely. It follows the pattern from the [Windows SDK sample](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/tree/master/Samples/UIAutomationCleanShutdown).\r\n\r\n<!-- We are in TELL-MODE the following section must be completed -->\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\n- UIA objects for disposed controls won't cause memory leak\r\n- UIA clients accessing UIA providers for disposed controls will get `UIA_E_ELEMENTNOTAVAILABLE` error\r\n\r\n## Regression? \r\n\r\n- No\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n- There should be no risk when the application is accessed by properly implemented UIA clients. These clients should be prepared to handle `UIA_E_ELEMENTNOTAVAILABLE` error and also release the UIA objects in timely manner. For misbehaving UIA clients it could cause a problem in the UIA client instead of a leak in the WinForms application.\r\n\r\n<!-- end TELL-MODE -->\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\n- Tested with VisualUIAVerifyNative and Accessibility Insight to ensure that the UIA clients react correctly to the change (longer description of effect available in #3182).\r\n- Tested with SciTech Memory Profiler to ensure that controls/forms with UIA providers are released when a form is closed and hence don't keep additional reference that would make these objects have prolonged lifetime.\r\n\r\n## Test environment(s) <!-- Remove any that don't apply -->\r\n\r\n- .NET 5 (master, winforms@d851dac649d74c3a1d2b416713dd22de14b93fe1)\r\n- .NET Core 3.1.200 with backported fix\r\n\r\n<!-- Mention language, UI scaling, or anything else that might be relevant -->\r\n\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/3308)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/3308","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Call UiaDisconnectProvider from Control.ReleaseUiaProvider\" (#3308)"},{"Id":"621579037","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-20T08:46:58","Actor":"nirzaf","Number":"3307","RawContent":null,"Title":"Winforms Designer Not Working with .NET Core 3.1 SDK","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Read https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/blob/master/Documentation/issue-guide.md -->\r\n\r\n* .NET Core Version:   3.1 LTS Version\r\n<!-- e.g. 3.1 LTS Version -->\r\n\r\n* Have you experienced this same bug with .NET Framework?:  No\r\n<!-- No -->\r\n\r\n**Problem description:**\r\n\r\n    Winform Designer looks like in a screenshot given below \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18024930/82425619-63543b00-9aa4-11ea-9532-bae05883afa1.png)\r\nCould not do any designing in Winforms\r\nI am using Visual Studio 16.6.0 Version Last Updated 20/05/2020\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/3307","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Winforms Designer Not Working with .NET Core 3.1 SDK\" (#3307)"},{"Id":"621374229","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-20T00:35:14","Actor":"KlausLoeffelmann","Number":"3306","RawContent":null,"Title":"Should we move System.Windows.Forms.Padding back to the System.Windows.Forms assembly","State":"open","Body":"While investigating a bug in the WinForms Core Designer, namely in the context of serialization of Resource files, I noticed that from 3.1 to 5.0 the `Padding` struct has moved from the `System.Windows.Forms` assembly to `System.Windows.Forms.Primitives`. This is the reason, at least from the perspective of deserializing resource files in the Core Designer, we can not retarget a WinForms 5.0 Core App back to 3.1. The type resolution service in the ResXDataNode processor, which is already version tolerant, cannot handle the new type name (at least not without introducing some black magic).\r\n\r\nSo, while this resources issues might be principally resolvable, my concern is that the `Padding` struct of all WinForms structs gets serialized and deserialized in typical Customer in mixed version scenarios (where e.g. 100 clients write some custom serialized files back to a server still running 3.1, and others already 5.0), which could cause real problems.\r\n\r\nSo, for that reason, I would propose to move the `Padding` struct back to the `System.Windows.Forms` namespace, or at least discuss the seriousness of my concern.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/3306","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Should we move System.Windows.Forms.Padding back to the System.Windows.Forms assembly\" (#3306)"},{"Id":"621179778","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-19T22:14:11","Actor":"OliaG","Number":"3304","RawContent":null,"Title":"Updated roadmap.md","State":"closed","Body":"Addressed comments from https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/3054\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/3304)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/3304","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Updated roadmap.md\" (#3304)"},{"Id":"620754719","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-05-19T07:45:07","Actor":"therawk","Number":"3303","RawContent":null,"Title":"Unable to select controls inside the TabControl","State":"open","Body":"* .NET Core Version: \r\n3.1.300-preview-015135\r\n\r\n* Have you experienced this same bug with .NET Framework?: \r\nNo\r\n\r\n**Problem description:**\r\nI added a TabControl and added other components like TextBox and Label and now want to drag the TextBox around.

It’s rather confusing and I think there is room for improvement. The ways and suggestions I found from multiple sources (Stackoverflow and few of your team mates) are:\r\n•\tDesignMode property is flag, but it doesn’t seem to be reliable. Some suggest its value is correct only in ctr after InitializeComponents. Others suggest walking the parents up and checking the property.\r\n•\tLicenseManager.UsageMode == LicenseUsageMode.Designtime; This is also not reliable enough, at least from my experience, it Is sometimes false whereas it should be true.\r\n•\tSystem.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess().ProcessName == \"devenv\" This seems clunky but seems to work for me (PR). However, if Visual Studio changes its process name it’ll stop working.\r\n•\tVarious sources suggest the combinations of the previous 3.\r\n\r\nI am not blaming anyone (I guess that’s clear?), I am just pointing to something which would be beneficial to improve on. Ideally:\r\n-\tWe won’t have both DesignMode and LicenceManager.UsageMode, but only one of these two. Having both is confusing already.\r\n-\tIt will be always reliable, not only from constructor.\r\n-\tIt will be in in the next .NET platform (core net 5?)\r\n-\tIf for any reason this won’t/can’t be done, please have the comments on these two properties (DesignMode and LicenceManager.UsageMode) explain all the caviats and details.\r\n\r\nThanks, Ogi!\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    Describe the current behavior, what is wrong or not working as expected.\r\n    Provide as much information as possible, including callstack for crashes/exceptions, screenshots or animations.\r\n  -->\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nIdeally I would have a Property on the System.ComponentModel.Component which would be completley reliable regardless of if it's used from constructor or not\r\n\r\n**Minimal repro:**\r\n1.

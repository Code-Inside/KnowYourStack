And finally found it out (I am happy :roll_eyes:). Facts:\r\n\r\n- Leaking are DC and Bitmap in approximately the same proportions.\r\n- This is not managed leaks - managed heap have not any increasing elements.  So GC not helping here and if `PropertyGrid` inside childe window, closing it will not help too.\r\n- Leaks are not reproduce on local machine. Only when you **connect** to rdp session. So if your rdp session is open - all is fine, to leak you need close rdp window and connect again. Tested on Win10 1909/20H2 hosts.\r\n- ~~I think amount of leaks are some how related to displaying property's, because some window leak more than others.~~\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17767561/118251665-8b585d80-b4b0-11eb-995f-ee2df025bf8c.mp4\r\n\r\nOur scenario was: we have an mdi app with many child windows that's have `PropertyGrid`, for one rdp connect we losing about 100 GDI objects.

Therefore, it was decided to leave the current code for the `ListViewAccessibilityObject`.\r\n\r\nWhen separating the `ListViewItemAccessibleObject`, we took into account how the `ListViewItemAccessibleObject` works with `ListViewGroups` and `ListViewItems` depending on the view.\r\n\r\n**ListViewItemBaseAccessibleObject**\r\nThe `ListViewItemBaseAccessibleObject` class has been added. It contains the implementation for most of the properties and methods of the `ListViewItemAccessibleObject` class. In addition, its implementation fully corresponds to the behavior of elements when the tree is in `LargeIcon` or `SmallIcon` view.\r\n\r\n**ListViewItemListAccessibleObject**\r\nFor the `List` view, an `ListViewItemListAccessibleObject` class has been added. It contains an overridden implementation for the `Bounds` and `RuntimeId` properties and the `FragmentNavigate` method. Since this view does not support `ListViewGroup`, it allows us to remove some unnecessary checks.\r\n\r\n**ListViewItemTileAccessibleObject**\r\nFor the `Tile` mode, an `ListViewItemTileAccessibleObject` class has been added. It contains implementations for methods such as `FragmentNavigate`, `GetChild`, `GetChildInternal`, `GetChildCount`, `GetChildIndex` and `GetSubItemBounds` methods. This is necessary because this mode supports `ListViewSubItems` and has complex logic to work with them. In addition, we have a special method `GetChildInternal`, which is necessary because inside the classes we operate with real indexes of `ListViewSubItems` , and not visible to the user.\r\n\r\n**ListViewItemDetailsAccessibleObject**\r\nFor `Details` mode, the `ListViewItemDetailsAccessibleObject` class has been added. It does not have such overloaded logic for working with `ListViewSubItems` as the `ListViewItemTileAccessibleObject` class, but it has special functionality for working with fake accessibility objects. This is necessary because the user sees the cell and can interact with it, whether there is a `ListViewSubItem` for it or not.\r\n\r\nSince `ListViewSubItems` do not support descendants, and all the logic for interacting with each other is taken from the `ListViewItemAccessibleObjects`, there is no point in separating the `ListViewSubItemAccessibleObject` of the class.\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n- No\r\n\r\n## Regression? \r\n-  No\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n- Minimal\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n- Unit tests\r\n\r\n## Accessibility testing  <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n- Inspect \r\n\r\n## Test environment(s) <!-- Remove any that don't apply -->\r\n- Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19041.388]\r\n- .NET Core SDK 6.0.100-preview.3.21202.5\r\n\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/api/codeflow?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/4910)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/4910","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Separating ListViewItemAccessibleObject\" (#4910)"},{"Id":"891593978","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-14T04:49:52","Actor":"RussKie","Number":"4909","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Proposal] Streamline application configuration and bootstrap","State":"open","Body":"# Overview\r\n\r\nHistorically Windows Forms designer was rendering its design surface based on hardcoded assumptions, such as control default font and dpi settings. However over the past 10-15 years not only multi-monitor configurations became a norm, monitor tech has made significant process making 4K, 5K, 8K, etc. monitors widely used by our consumers. The Windows itself has been innovating and tinkering with UI configurations, such default font metrics, which over the years deviated from \"Microsoft Sans Serif, 8pt\" and now is set to \"Segoe UI, 9pt\".\r\n\r\nThe Windows Forms runtime has been (more or less) keeping up with the changes, e.g.  providing a new API to [set high dpi mode](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/396), or by updating the [default font](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/656). The default font change has unearthed numerous issues in the runtime (e.g. different font-based scaling), which we considered addressing by providing (yet another) API to set an [application-wide default font](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/3001). \r\n\r\nHowever during numerous discussions the team has identified probably the biggest flaw in the current separation of the runtime and the designer, and the overall move from .NET Framework assumptions - the lack of a mechanism to share Windows Forms project-level configuration settings between the runtime and the designer. That is, if the app is configured to run with disabled visual styles, in PerMonitorV2, and have an application-wide default font set to \"Arial, 14pt\" there is no way to show the designer surface with the same settings to truly provide the WYSIWYG experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nFunnily enough Visual Basic apps are in a good position for the designer integration with their Application Framework functionality, i.e. \"*.myapp\" file. The C# project lack this mechanism, and traditionally have been a configuration-code-first approach.\r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this proposal is to \r\n1 **streamline a Windows Forms application configuration and bootstrap**, \r\n2. with the view that this will facilitate the **sharing of the information between the runtime and the designer during the development phase**. That is, whenever the designers surface process is started configuration information is read from a known location, and necessary configurations are applied (e.g. run the design surface in PerMonitorV2 mode, or set a form/usercontrol default font to \"Arial, 14pt\"). ⚠️  **out of scope**, tracked under https://github.com/dotnet/winforms-designer/issues/3192.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** The new functionality is opt-in, i.e. unless a developer makes a conscience decision to use the new configuration and the bootstrap mechanism existing applications will continue to work as-is, and the current developer experience will remain the same.\r\n\r\n### 1. Visual Basic \r\nFor VB projects this known location is \"myapp\" file.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4403806/114354200-3d9abd80-9bb1-11eb-9d48-a43f299f82e1.png)\r\n\r\nThe designer surface process should have no issues reading configuration values from a myapp file.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of avenues we can take to facilitate an integrated devex such as:\r\n1. Enhance the VB Application Framework in the same way as it was done for `HighDpiMode` (see #3705). This requires changes on the VS side. \r\n2. Until the necessary changes on the VS side are done provide a workaround similar to the one performed for `HighDpiMode` in .NET 5.0 (see: #3894)\r\n3. Alternatively we can consider departing from VBAF/myapp generators and replace those with a source generator. This will necessitate a separate investigation and proposal (**out of scope**).\r\n\r\n### Other points for further consideration:\r\n- How to read app.manifest/app.config for dpi values. See \"How to resolve dpi settings?\" below.\r\n\r\nThe final decision is TBD. /cc: @KlausLoeffelmann @KathleenDollard \r\n\r\n### 2. C#\r\n\r\nFor C# projects the issue is little more involved. There are several candidates for storing settings, such as a csproj file, an app.config or a new configuration file.\r\nAfter deliberations and discussions we propose the settings to be stored in the csproj file for the following reasons:\r\n- The designer surface process should have no issues reading configuration values from a myapp file.\r\n- Unlike schema enforced app.config, a csproj can contain an arbitrary set of settings, easily manageable and available to MSBuild process.\r\n- app.configs don't appear to be very popular in .NET apps.\r\n- Whilst developers who build their apps on .NET Framework 4.7+ maybe familiar with [app.config ApplicationConfigurationSection](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/winforms/windows-forms-add-configuration-element) and/or [app.config AppContextSwitchOverrides](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/appcontextswitchoverrides-element), we have removed all dependencies on app.config and these quirks which those two provided in .NET Core 3.0 timeframe.\r\n  > 💭  It is also worth noting that quirks were necessary in .NET Framework, which was installed in-place, and didn't provided any kind of side-by-side deployment. In a rare and unfortunate event where we may accidentally break end users experiences in a given release users will be able to install a previous working .NET release and run their application against it until a fix becomes available.\r\n- whilst there maybe an argument that app.config can be changed by users, thus altering behaviours of applications, and changes to csproj will require a recompilation, it is also worth noting that our SDK is built with developers in mind, and not the ability of users to alter the application behaviours at will. If an app developer feels it is important to allow the app users to change the default font or dpi settings via an app.config it is the developers responsibility to facilitate that mechanism to the users.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe runtime portion will leverage source generators to read configurations from the csproj, and emit code for the necessary API, e.g. call `Application.SetHighDpiMode(HighDpiMode.PerMonitorV2)` and `Application.SetDefaultFont(\"Arial, 14pt\")`.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4403806/114354384-8488b300-9bb1-11eb-855a-b58e80953793.png)\r\n\r\nWith that we will be able to leverage the power of Roslyn analyzers to warn developers about duplicate/redundant API invocations performed outside the generated code.\r\n\r\n### 3. Visual Studio (out of scope)\r\nTo complete the user experience we can consider leveraging (e.g. copying) VBAF property pages and provide the same experience to C# developers.\r\n\r\n# How to resolve dpi settings?\r\n\r\nAt this point an astute Windows Forms developer will say that there are currently 3 different ways to configure dpi settings (which may or may not be mutually exclusive or complimentary):\r\n* [app.manifest](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/sbscs/application-manifests) - Common Control related configuration, dealing with it was always a pain. Very likely that a significant part of Windows Forms developers have never heard of it.\r\n* [app.config ApplicationConfigurationSection](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/winforms/windows-forms-add-configuration-element) and [app.config AppContextSwitchOverrides](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/configure-apps/file-schema/runtime/appcontextswitchoverrides-element).\r\n* [`Application.SetHighDpiMode(HighDpiMode)`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.windows.forms.application.sethighdpimode).\r\n\r\nThis proposal introduces a 4th way of configuring dpi, and to make it successful it has to (paraphrasing JRR Tolkien):\r\n\r\n> _One API to rule them all, One API to find them,_\r\n> _One API to bring them all and in the ProjectConfiguration bind them..._\r\n\r\nThe benefit the new approach provides is by facilitating the sharing of the information between the runtime and the designer during the development phase, as well as unifying how dpi settings are configured. This benefit is believed to outweigh the need to remove several lines of code from `Main()` method and adding several properties into a `cspoj` file.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's how we plan to resolve a project's dpi settings:\r\n\r\n1. If a custom app.manifest is specified, read it. It takes the precedence as it is used when the process is created, before Windows Forms runtime gets involved. \r\n2. Since the runtime no longer reads any settings from the app.config we will ignore it. It is possible to use Roslyn analyzers to warn a developer that app.config switches are no longer supported.\r\n3. Also check for `Application.SetHighDpiMode(HighDpiMode)` in the application's entry method - either the default `static void Main()` or as specified by `StartupObject` property.\r\n4. If there are multiple values are detected warn the developer.\r\n5. If no values are detected - use a default value we agree upon (e.g. `PerMonitorV2`).\r\n\r\n# Other considerations\r\n\r\n* The new source generator project will form a new Windows Forms artifact, and will be part of Windows Desktop bundle. It will also need to be references by a Windows Forms C# project by default.\r\n* The default C# template will need to be updated to replace the current project configurations with the new source generated method.\r\n* Plan the Roslyn analyzers taxonomy for warnings/errors, and other related considerations.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/4909","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[Proposal] Streamline application configuration and bootstrap\" (#4909)"},{"Id":"883951616","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-14T02:15:23","Actor":"SenthilKumaranRajan","Number":"4887","RawContent":null,"Title":"Smart Tag support in WF","State":"closed","Body":"<!-- Read https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/blob/main/docs/issue-guide.md -->\r\n\r\n* .NET Core Version: \r\n.Netcore 3.1 and NET 5\r\n\r\n* Have you experienced this same bug with .NET Framework?: \r\nNo\r\n\r\n**Problem description:**\r\n\r\nThe smart tag is not working properly for the NETCore project.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\n\r\nThe smart tag should work properly as like .NETFramework\r\n\r\nAttached the code example in the below link\r\n\r\n[CustomControlWithSmartTag.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/files/6457287/CustomControlWithSmartTag.zip)\r\n\r\n**Minimal repro:**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44424557/117776267-03c4e180-b259-11eb-87ff-621918cac4a6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/4887","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Smart Tag support in WF\" (#4887)"},{"Id":"891532885","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-14T02:07:08","Actor":"RussKie","Number":"4908","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support designer capabilities at runtime","State":"open","Body":"# Context\r\n\r\nThe Windows Forms SDK consist of two distinct parts – the **runtime** (the code that executes, open sourced in this repo) and the **designer** (consists of the \"_general purpose_\" and \"_Visual Studio-specific_\"  components, close sourced).

It is important for our customers, that the logic of their LOB apps to this end becomes way more flexible and can be rearchitected away from code-behind and towards layers. At the same time, we need to make sure, that they can minimize the risk for this rearchitectural process, and therefore we should provide a soft migration option to reach this sound architecture: WinForms should be able to consume ViewModels or Controllers which are designed by a certain industry standard.\r\n\r\n### Introducing architectures to WinForms which can be reused for Mobile/Azure based scenarios\r\n\r\nThe ultimate goal is, that our customer’s LOB logic can be leverage to other UI technologies (Maui, WinUi, WPF) and the Cloud, and can on top be easily unit tested, _all of which is not possible with the typical existing WinForms code-behind methodology._\r\n\r\n### Using EntityFramework and EntityFramework Core instead of the ancient Typed DataSets**\r\n\r\nThe other advantage is an easier adaptation and migration away from ancient WinForms DataLayer architectures: While typed `DataSet` and `DataTable` were clearly designed with the WinForms code-behind model in mind, with these new DataBinding features present, modernized WinForms Apps could easily consume typical ViewModels and Models as their Controller and Data Layer abstractions, and, what's important: Models in this scenarios being POCO classes which are generated and maintained by EntityFramework and EntityFramework Core.\r\n\r\n## API-Changes:\r\n\r\nTo provide a more ViewModel/View Controller compatible way for a WinForms LOB architecture, I propose the following API-Changes:\r\n\r\n* Introduce a bindable `Command` property on the `Button` class of type `ICommand` (we should identify other potential controls)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9663150/117886177-abdfa800-b263-11eb-94d2-a582a08b0fb0.png)\r\n\r\n* Implement `IBindableComponent` on `ToolStripItem`, to make all `ToolStripItem` derived components bindable, and introduce a bindable `Command` property on all `ToolStripItem` derived components which can be clicked.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9663150/117886405-feb95f80-b263-11eb-899d-c849e704c846.png)\r\n\r\n* Introduce a `IDataContextTarget` interface with a property `DataContext`.\r\n* Explicit implement `IDataContextTarget` in the `Form` class and in the `UserControl` class.\r\n* Introduce an `AssignDataContext` Event on Form and UserControl, which gets raised, when the setter of said property gets written, so that WinForms dev can reroute the DataSource to the appropriate `BindingSource` of the `Form` or the `UserControl`.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9663150/117886048-7fc42700-b263-11eb-9a0a-4c14818620aa.png)\r\n\r\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9663150/117886480-227ca580-b264-11eb-81d3-595d3dcba139.png)\r\n\r\n* Optional: To reroute individual Events and bind them to a ViewModel or UI Controller, introduce a `BindableCommandComponent` (more to come).\r\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/4895","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[WIP] Introduce Commands and DataContext to WinForms to adapt modern Binding scenarios\" (#4895)"},{"Id":"885320538","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-11T18:32:54","Actor":"mmitche","Number":"4889","RawContent":null,"Title":"Use .NET certificate","State":"closed","Body":"Enables an automatic swap from Microsoft400 to MicrosoftDotNet500\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/api/codeflow?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/4889)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/4889","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Use .NET certificate\" (#4889)"},{"Id":"887072732","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2021-05-11T12:54:23","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"4890","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:b9a1a4bb-2302-4987-3b3d-08d8b8050dda)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: b9a1a4bb-2302-4987-3b3d-08d8b8050dda\r\n- **Build**: 20210510.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: 5/10/2021 5:53 PM\r\n- **Commit**: 44324e2d3563921f60b1522fccf3fef45dcfe636\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

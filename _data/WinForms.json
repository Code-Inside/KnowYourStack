Internally WinForms has moved much of it's rendering to GDI (starting in .NET 2.0) and has provided some entry points with GDI via `IDeviceContext`. Adding overloads to `ControlPaint` methods will allow more performant rendering of custom controls. It allows direct use of paint event arguments in `OnPaint`  as they now expose `IDeviceContext` (as opposed to `e.Graphics`, which has huge overhead).\r\n\r\n### API\r\n\r\n``` C#\r\n    public sealed

5.0.0\r\nMicrosoft.WindowsDesktop.App 5.0.0\r\nSDK 5.0.100\r\nVisual Studio Community Version 16.8.2\r\n\r\n* Have you experienced this same bug with .NET Framework?: \r\nNo\r\n\r\n**Problem description:**\r\nIn the designer, upon activating a second tab page containing a User Control with a TreeView in it, VS hangs.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:**\r\nVisual Studio does not hang and the designer continues to work normally.\r\n\r\n**Minimal repro:**\r\n[SetFocusBug.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/files/5656851/SetFocusBug.zip)\r\n\r\nThis project was created with the following steps:\r\n* Create a Windows Form App (.NET) project.\r\n* Open Form1 in the designer.\r\n* Add a TabControl and keep the two tabs.\r\n* Add a User Control to the project. Open it in design mode.\r\n* Add a TreeView to the User Control and build the project to compile it.\r\n* Add the User Control to the second TabPage on the Form.\r\n* Save form.\r\n* Switch to the first TabPage and then back to the second and the hang should occur.\r\n* Upon recovering, simply reopen the form and switch to the second TabPage to cause the hang again (assuming the save went through).\r\n\r\nIf using the attached project, build before opening the form (hang does not happen until build is made and designer reopened).\r\n\r\nYou may also need to rebuild in that VS session, or with the designer open. I am seeing inconsistent behavior where the designer does not show the User Control at all after I open the project in a fresh session of VS.\r\n\r\nThese variants of the project do NOT produce any hangs or other undesirable behavior:\r\n* UserControl does not contain TreeView\r\n* TreeView directly on TabPage without user control\r\n* UserControl with TreeView on first TabPage (at least, having it visible when the form loads does not hang)\r\n\r\nI attempted to debug both VS and DesignServerTools but I am not sure exactly what I am looking at.\r\n\r\nVS' UI thread seems to hang waiting for a response from the DesignServerTools for a Hit Test on the designer or a control or something.\r\n\r\nOne of the DesignServerTools threads that stuck out to me seems to get struck calling the native SetFocus WinAPI whenever I happened to pause it. It seems to call it but the call never completes if I try to step over it.\r\n\r\nKilling the DesignServerTools process tends to allow VS to recover so I believe the problem lies with DesignServerTools.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/4336","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"In Designer, Nesting a TreeView in a UserControl in a second TabPage on a Form hangs DesignServerTools.exe\" (#4336)"},{"Id":"758998412","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-08T02:12:13","Actor":"Olina-Zhang","Number":"4335","RawContent":null,"Title":"AccessibilityInsights: ComboBox items should support ScrollItem Pattern when list shows scrollbar","State":"open","Body":"* .NET Core Version: \r\n6.0.100-alpha.1.20603.2\r\n\r\n* Have you experienced this same bug with .NET Framework?: \r\nYes,\r\nThis is a regression issue, can repro in .Net 4.8 for comboBox with all dropdownstyle values, and in .Net 4.7.2, just comboBox items with comboBox's dropdownstyle: simple can repro this issue.\r\n\r\n**Minimal repro:**\r\n1.

(Only the focused radio button in a group has `TabStop=true`.) However, the order in which the controls are added to this \"arrow order\" array appears to depend on the order with which they were added to the form in the `InitializeComponent()` method. Since the order of calls in this method cannot be manually changed (without being immediately reverted by the designer), I cannot set the \"arrow order\" myself. In my project, the runtime \"arrow order\" happens to be bottom-to-top (pressing the up arrow moves the focus to the next radio button _below_ the currently focused button), but I believe that is due to sheer random chance. It could just as well be in a meaningless, seemingly random order.\r\n\r\nI need a way to ensure that the \"arrow order\" is logically related to the visual position of the controls on the form. I don't know what this should look like in terms of API, as (a) the ordering of a group of radio buttons needs to be independent of any other group of radio buttons on the form, and (b) this logic appears to be performed by native code, not by Windows Forms proper.\r\n\r\n_Have you experienced this same bug with .NET Framework?_ \r\nHave not checked, as .NET Framework is EOL.\r\n\r\n## Version info\r\n```\r\n.NET SDK (reflecting any global.json):\r\n Version:   5.0.100\r\n Commit:    5044b93829\r\n\r\nRuntime Environment:\r\n OS Name:     Windows\r\n OS Version:  10.0.20262\r\n OS Platform: Windows\r\n RID:         win10-x64\r\n Base Path:   C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk\\5.0.100\\\r\n\r\nHost (useful for support):\r\n  Version: 5.0.0\r\n  Commit:  cf258a14b7\r\n\r\n.NET SDKs installed:\r\n  3.0.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n  5.0.100 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\sdk]\r\n\r\n.NET runtimes installed:\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All 2.1.23 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.All]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 2.1.23 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 3.1.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 5.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.1.23 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 3.1.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.NETCore.App 5.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.NETCore.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.3 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 3.1.9 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n  Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 5.0.0 [C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n\r\nTo install additional .NET runtimes or SDKs:\r\n  https://aka.ms/dotnet-download\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/4321","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Radio button \"arrow order\" cannot be configured\" (#4321)"},{"Id":"756951523","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-05T04:35:06","Actor":"msoeken","Number":"4324","RawContent":null,"Title":"Typo in README","State":"closed","Body":"Just a small typo in the README.\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/4324)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/4324","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Typo in README\" (#4324)"},{"Id":"756808429","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-12-04T05:13:43","Actor":"Olina-Zhang","Number":"4323","RawContent":null,"Title":"AccessibilityInsights: Misplaced bounding rectangle for ComboBox items when drop down shows a scrollbar ","State":"open","Body":"* .NET Core Version: \r\n6.0.100-alpha.1.20603.2\r\n\r\n* Have you experienced this same bug with .NET Framework?: \r\nYes, \r\nThis is a regression issue, can repro in .Net 4.8, and cannot repro in .Net 4.7.2.\r\n\r\n**Minimal repro:**\r\n1.

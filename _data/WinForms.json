For example, a button with `UseMnemonic = true` and `Text = \"&Button\"` will be displayed as \"<ins>B</ins>utton\" and can be activated by pressing Alt+B. If `UseMnemonic` is set to `false`, ampersand will be treated as a regular character, and Alt+B shortcut won't work.\r\n\r\nAccessible objects set mnemonic shortcut in `AccessKey` and `KeyboardShortcut` properties, which makes screen readers read the shortcut when control is focused. However, when mnemonic is disabled by setting `UseMnemonic = false`, accessible properties ignore it and still set the shortcut. Screen readers will read the shortcut, even though it doesn't work.\r\n\r\n#### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/winforms/assets/102954094/2a100682-d544-4d6a-848e-e25f4ab7a2b7\r\n\r\nNarrator reads the form as follows:\r\n\r\n> Mnemonic, edit, Alt+ m, \r\n> No mnemonic, edit, Alt+ n, \r\n> Mnemonic, button, Alt+ e, \r\n> No mnemonic, button, Alt+ o, \r\n> Mnemonic, radio button, selected, Alt+ i, \r\n> Mnemonic, radio button, non-selected, Alt+ i, \r\n> No mnemonic, radio button, selected, Alt+ c, \r\n\r\nFor controls with \"No mnemonic\" text, pressing announced shortcut will not do anything\r\n\r\n#### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n* `AccessKey` and `KeyboardShortcut` should be empty when mnemonics are disabled\r\n* Narrator should not read shortcut when mnemonics are disabled\r\n* Narrator should read ampersand as part of the text when mnemonics are disabled, exactly as displayed\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRun sample app: \r\n[MnemonicRepro.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/files/11759886/MnemonicRepro.zip)\r\n\r\nMost likely it also reproduces with all controls derived from Button and Label.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/9296","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Accessible properties AccessKey and KeyboardShortcut ignore UseMnemonic = false\" (#9296)"},{"Id":"1758677940","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-15T12:27:12","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"9295","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/runtime","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:d9f5b309-084f-43b5-02de-08d8b80548e4)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/runtime\r\n- **Subscription**: d9f5b309-084f-43b5-02de-08d8b80548e4\r\n- **Build**: 20230614.15\r\n- **Date Produced**: June 15, 2023 9:13:52 AM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: 171a525880315369e48c6adf6c181f98357352a5\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -

For more information on what click through is, I recommend reading https://daringfireball.net/2003/05/interface_details_itunes_vs_safari . In Windows, pretty much all applications use \"click through,\" whereby if you have one window active and click on to another one, the mouse click activates the window and the click is processed by whatever control you had the mouse over.\r\n\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/rickbrew/how-to-enable-click-through-for-net-2-0-toolstrip-and-menustrip\r\n\n\n### API Proposal\n\n```csharp\r\npublic class ToolStrip\r\n{\r\n   public bool ClickThrough=true;\r\n\r\n   protected override void WndProc(ref Message m)\r\n    {\r\n        base.WndProc(ref m);\r\n        if (this.clickThrough &&\r\n            m.Msg == NativeConstants.WM_MOUSEACTIVATE &&\r\n            m.Result == (IntPtr)NativeConstants.MA_ACTIVATEANDEAT)\r\n        {\r\n            m.Result = (IntPtr)NativeConstants.MA_ACTIVATE;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\n\n### API Usage\n\nEnable/Disable the `ClickThrough` property to change the behavior.\r\n\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\ndefault value of property set to `false`\n\n### Risks\n\nIf default is true, then behavior could change in existing applications.\n\n### Will this feature affect UI controls?\n\nYes. Toolstrip will allow click through by default or at least allow click through after the developer enables it.\r\n\r\nUnsure on accessibility impact.\r\n\r\nFeature is not localizable.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/9288","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Add `ClickThrough` to `ToolStrip`/`MenuStrip` to bring behavior in-line with other controls.\" (#9288)"},{"Id":"1755675416","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-14T00:29:47","Actor":"dreddy-work","Number":"9285","RawContent":null,"Title":"port to release/7.0: Disable UI tests in release branches.","State":"closed","Body":"Disable UI tests in release branches.\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/api/codeflow?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/9285)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/9285","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"port to release/7.0: Disable UI tests in release branches.\" (#9285)"},{"Id":"1753218570","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-13T23:43:43","Actor":"JeremyKuhne","Number":"9278","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fully enable ComWrappers for COM TypeDescriptor","State":"closed","Body":"Uses ComHelpers to query for interface pointers to enable all COM scenarios (ComWrappers, Com Interop, our own Com exposed classes).\r\n\r\n- Change Com2DataTypeToManagedDataTypeConverter to go between VARIANT and object.\r\n- Remove Activator.CreateInstance call for type converters from Com2PropertyDescriptor and just create the instances directly as needed.\r\n- Add a NullTypeDescriptor to simplify the ComTypeDescriptor.\r\n- Add reverse IUnknown* cast operator to VARIANT.\r\n- Ensure we don't return null from BSTR.ToStringAndFree and only free if it isn't null.\r\n- Change RegisterInterfaceInGlobal to return HRESULT for easier debugging.\r\n- Use centralized IDispatch property gettter/setter helpers and ensure we free any returned exception BSTRs.\r\n- Add IVTable to additional COM structs.\r\n- Add tests to cover both legacy COM and ComWrappers and also validate IProvideMulitpleClassInfo\r\n- Move IDispatchTests to the right namespace.\r\n- Seal classes, revise variable names, split out COM struct files, and other various cleanup.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/9278","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fully enable ComWrappers for COM TypeDescriptor\" (#9278)"},{"Id":"1755470413","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-13T22:24:38","Actor":"dreddy-work","Number":"9284","RawContent":null,"Title":"Disable UI tests in release branch.","State":"closed","Body":"Disable UI tests in release branches while increasing retry count in main.\r\n\r\nWill be ported to release branches.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/9284","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Disable UI tests in release branch.\" (#9284)"},{"Id":"1755340863","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-13T21:51:20","Actor":"vseanreesermsft","Number":"9282","RawContent":null,"Title":"Merging internal commits for release/6.0","State":"closed","Body":"null\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/api/codeflow?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/9282)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/9282","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Merging internal commits for release/6.0\" (#9282)"},{"Id":"1754082121","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-06-13T20:10:37","Actor":"HindujaArugula","Number":"9280","RawContent":null,"Title":"A11y_.NET Core_WinForms_PrintingTesting_PrintingTesting_ScreenReader: After pressing ENTER on \"Printing Testing\" tab Narrator is not announcing the status message of the dialog \"Generate Preview\".","State":"closed","Body":"### .NET version\n\n.NET-SDK-8.0.100-preview.4.23260.5\n\n### Did it work in .NET Framework?\n\nNo\n\n### Did it work in any of the earlier releases of .NET Core or .NET 5+?\n\nNo response\n\n### Issue description\n\n### GitHubTags:\r\n#A11yMAS;#A11yTCS;#BM_.NET Core[Winforms]-Win32-May2023;#.NET Core;#A11ySev3;#WCAG4.1.3;#DesktopApp;#Win11;#NonBenchmark;#Narrator;#NVDA;\r\n\r\n### Actual:\r\nAfter pressing ENTER on \"Printing_Controls:Testing the controls under the Printings Tab\" a \"Generating Previews\" dialog appears Narrator is not announcing any status message of the dialog as \"Generate Preview\".\r\n\r\n### Note: Issue is not observed with NVDA.\r\n\r\n### Expected:\r\nAfter pressing ENTER on \"Printing_Controls:Testing the controls under the Printings Tab\" a \"Generating Previews\" dialog appears Narrator should announce the status message of the dialog as \"Generate Preview\".\r\n\r\n### User Impact:\r\nScreen Reader users will face difficulty if narrator does not announce the status message of the dialog.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

Some controls like Label support it by adding an underscore for a mnemonic character and making it a shortcut. But DateTimePicker doesn't seem to support it, '&' is interpreted as a regular character without any special meaning, it doesn't create a shortcut. I didn't find a way to turn '&' into a mnemonic by escaping it with `\\` or similar, and there is no documentation on Win32 DateTimePicker regarding mnemonic characters.\r\n\r\nAs a result, Narrator announces it as a shortcut, although it doesn't work, unlike a mnemonic shortcut from Label with `\"&Date\"` text:\r\n![datetimepicker-shortcut](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/assets/102954094/16545a90-d9b1-4011-bdba-6073a25b8eb2)\r\n\r\nAccessKey and KeyboardShortcut accessibility properties should be empty instead of \"Alt+t\":\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/assets/102954094/0d64730c-03f1-4829-9dc7-8ff99139fe4d)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

For example, the Forms and UserControl designers in the WinForms Designers are root designers themselves. Root Designer support is also needed, to provide special design support, like for custom Report Designers.\r\n\r\nWe are primarily tracking this work in our internal WinForms Designer repository. This issue has rather informative purpose, to point our progress and plans, and what breaking changes in contrast to the .NET Framework root designer APIs we will expect.\r\n\r\n- [x] **Refactoring of the Toolbox handling for .NET Components in the Out-of-Proc Designers.** Part of the required foundation for the implementation for Root Designer APIs is the refactoring of the Toolbox item handling.  PRs for that are pending and will be merged soon.\r\n- [x] **Create Solution Templates for Root Designer solutions**, so the necessary Client- and Server-projects can get properly packed and loaded into both the client- and server-process at design time.\r\n- [ ] **Replicate `ToolboxItemFilter` attributes from NuGet-packaged and referenced components including Type and Project information, for correct filtering.\r\n- [ ] **API design process:** Conventionalize the principal approach for public surfacing APIs to provide custom toolbox item control, filtering, and the principal design surface at design time. Requirements need to be synced with our first- and third-party Partners and Control Library vendors. \r\n- [ ] **Implement Rendering functionality and the required inter-process-communication**\r\n- [ ] **Support infrastructure for selection, overlays, adorners.**\r\n\r\n## What are the principal challenges and difference the Designers?\r\n\r\nPlease read up on the Out-of-process Designer design principles for Control Designers first, to get a basic understanding about the architectural challenges:\r\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/custom-controls-for-winforms-out-of-process-designer/\r\n\r\n* Implementing Root Designer functionality requires document designers, each respective for the client (Visual Studio) and the server process (DesignToolsServer). \r\n* The Toolbox handling can only be happening on the client, and user-interaction with the toolbox needs to be communicated to the server process. To this end, a client-side document designer needs to be implemented and needs to be inherited from a proxy designer base class. (Details to be provided).\r\n* The rendering of graphical content and design-adornments on the other hand, can only be happening at the server-side. This will be happening and controlled by a document designer which will implement the `IRootDesigner` interface. **Note**: Since the Toolbox handling need to be handled exclusively on the client-side, `IRootDesigner` and `IToolboxUser` cannot be implemented on the same designer base class. `IToolboxUser` needs to be implemented on the client-side Designer; both Designers need to be communicating between the processed with internal Designer infrastructure.\r\n* The server-side root designer will not be able to use classic controls for the render-surface the same way it was possible for the in-proc-designer. The reason is, that due to inter-process-limitations, we need to send mouse-event information from the client to the server-side. We will provide a special Designer View via the SDK, with exact details yet to be determined.\r\n\r\nWe expect a Designer SDK preview (with API definitions subject to change) in the Visual Studio 17 time-frame.\r\n\r\nNote: The work on this is an ongoing process, and we will provide more details when they become available.

This can cause an error if another thread writes to the dictionary at the same time.\n\n<https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/blob/5bf1bff0e58e41f748a8a6d7c666ed28e033e318/src/System.Windows.Forms/src/System/Windows/Forms/Application.ThreadContext.cs#L513-L521>\n\nWriters do `lock (s_tcInternalSyncObject)` but this reader doesn't.  AFAICT, the callers of Application.ThreadContext.FromId don't lock it either.\n\nBefore <https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/8161>, `s_contextHash` used to be a Hashtable, which is safe for one writer in parallel with multiple readers.  Dictionary\\<TKey, TValue\\> is not safe for that use.\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nFound by source code inspection, not reproduced.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/13246","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Application.ThreadContext.FromId reads from s_contextHash while another thread may be writing\" (#13246)"},{"Id":"2974885848","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-06T11:17:22","Actor":"pcblues","Number":"13245","RawContent":null,"Title":"Changes and testing for 12042 review","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please read CONTRIBUTING.md before submitting a pull request -->\r\n\r\nFixes #12042 - TreeNode and ListItem not displaying in dark mode during editing, even though application is set to be in dark mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIf the application is in dark mode, capture the parent's windows message to identify the start of editing, and change the colour of the brush to match the parent's window color. \r\n\r\n<!-- We are in TELL-MODE the following section must be completed -->\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n\r\nCorrection of incorrect color selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Regression? \r\n\r\n- Yes / No\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nI tried to limit the impact of the change to only occurring when the application is in dark mode.

This approach leverages Windows DWM cloaking flags to keep controls hidden until fully themed and ready, significantly improving accessibility compliance and user experience across all applications.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe current WinForms runtime suffers from momentary visual flashing when controls are created or initialized. This occurs because the Desktop Window Manager (DWM) applies default white rendering before the application can override with themed styling. For users with dark mode enabled or those with photosensitivity conditions, this creates an uncomfortable white flash effect. (I am target-audience here, it REALLY does!!)\n\nThis issue represents both a user-experience-problem and a significant accessibility concern. Visual flashing during UI transitions can trigger adverse reactions in users with photosensitive epilepsy, migraines, or visual processing sensitivities. Modern accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1) explicitly recommend avoiding content that flashes to prevent these issues.\n\nSimilar problems were previously resolved in Windows components like File Explorer and addressed in Chromium-based browsers, demonstrating that this issue is recognized and solvable at the platform level. The WinForms runtime should implement an equivalent solution to ensure consistent visual experiences, especially for dark mode and high-contrast scenarios.\n\n## 30,000-Feet View of the principal Approach\n\nI propose implementing a standardized cloaking mechanism in the WinForms runtime that would:\n\n1. Temporarily make controls/windows invisible during initialization using DWM cloaking flags, either by a global setting which leads to that behavior implicitly, or with a per-instance-approach by changing certain behaviors on control itself.\n2. TBD: Scope of cloaking/duration of cloaking:\n   a) Only Pre-Filling background\n      - Pre-fill the background with the appropriate theme color before rendering begins.\n      - Remove cloak.\n      \n   b) Whole initialization process:\n      - Pre-fill the background with the appropriate theme color before rendering begins.\n      - Complete all initialization, property setting, and child control population.\n      - Remove the cloak only when the control is fully ready to display.\n\n### New APIs on Application\n\nAn additional setting similar to the `SetHighDpiMode` method or the `HighDpiMode` property on Application:\n\n`Application.SetCloakControlsMode(Never|Always|TypeBased|InstanceBased)` with its default as backwards compatible: `Never`.\n\nFor the Options `CloakControlsMode.TypeBased` and `CloakControlsMode.InstanceBased` we would need a global event handler based on Application (rough idea):\n\nThe EventArgs needed:\n\n```csharp\n/// <summary>\n/// Event arguments for cloaking decisions.\n/// </summary>\npublic class CloakEventArgs : EventArgs\n{\n    /// <summary>\n    /// Initializes a new instance of this class.\n    /// </summary>\n    public CloakEventArgs(Type controlType, Control? control = null)\n    {\n        ControlType = controlType;\n        Control = control;\n        ShouldCloak = false; // Default to false\n    }\n\n    /// <summary>\n    ///  The type of control being evaluated for cloaking.\n    /// </summary>\n    public Type ControlType { get; }\n\n    /// <summary>\n    ///  The instance of the control being evaluated for cloaking (if applicable).\n    /// </summary>\n    public Control? Control { get; set; }\n\n    /// <summary>\n    ///  Gets or sets whether the control should be cloaked.\n    ///  Set to true by event handlers to enable cloaking.\n    /// </summary>\n    public bool ShouldCloak { get; set; }\n}\n```\n\nThen, the individual decision for cloaking a type for example, could look something like this:\n\n```csharp\nstatic class Program\n{\n    [STAThread]\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        Application... (Init stuff)\n        \n        // Register cloaking handlers\n        Application.CloakingRequested += OnCloakingRequested;\n        \n        Application.Run(new MainForm());\n    }\n    \n    private static void OnCloakingRequested(object sender, CloakEventArgs e)\n    {\n        // Type-level decisions\n        Type type = e.ControlType;\n        \n        // Check for specific types that should be cloaked\n        if (type == typeof(ToolStrip) || \n            type == typeof(MenuStrip) || \n            type == typeof(StatusStrip))\n        {\n            e.ShouldCloak = true;\n            return;\n        }\n        \n        // Check for types in specific namespaces\n        string ns = type.Namespace ?? \"\";\n        if (ns.StartsWith(\"MyCompany.Controls.Special\"))\n        {\n            e.ShouldCloak = true;\n            return;\n        }\n        \n        // Default is false (already set in the event args)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy implementing this enhancement, the .NET WinForms runtime would significantly improve the experience for users of dark mode and those with accessibility needs, bringing it in line with modern UI framework expectations and accessibility standards.\n\nThere are several approaches then for the actual cloaking approach on windows level, which are under investigation and subject for follow-ups and amendments.\n\n## Why not just having a respective `CloakOnInit` property on Control?\n\nSounds way easier right? Just implement it ambient, and we would be done.\nWell, I think the problem is the way, that the WinForms Desiger's CodeDOM serialization has been originally ... designed. Namely, the order in which properties should be set, must not matter, except where it is absolutely necessary in which cases, we'd need to use `ISupportInitialization`. And that does not fly to retro-fit on control AT ALL.\n\n## List of new APIs\n\nTBD.\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/13233","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[API Suggestion]

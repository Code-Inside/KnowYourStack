This is not entirely accurate. Keys type has a set of standard values, but the ShortcutKeys property does not, Shortcuts are combinations or keys and modifiers that follow certain rules, it's not practical to present all combinations for user to step through with up/down keys or with mouse wheel. We need to disable scrolling through potential values in the properyt grid.\r\n\r\nThis behavior regressed when we added Keys.None value to the list of standard values - #8401. This was done to localize \"None\" (as \"(none)\") in the property grid. We should keep this value in the type converted tables for localization purposes. But we should remove it from the list of standard values. When the current value of the shortcut is not one of the standard values, property grid entry does not enter the \"scroll through the standard items\" functionality, which we want to block again.\r\n\r\nFixes #12982\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/13280)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/13280","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Property grid entry for ShortCut keys should not be up/down scrollable\" (#13280)"},{"Id":"2983066851","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-09T22:02:30","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"13278","RawContent":null,"Title":"[dnceng-bot] Branch `winforms/release/8.0` can't be merged to Azdo internal branch","State":"closed","Body":"Branch [release/8.0](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/commits/release/8.0/) in `dotnet/winforms` repo can't be mirrored from GitHub to Azure [internal/release/8.0](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_git/dotnet-winforms?version=GBinternal%2Frelease%2F8.0&_a=history) via internal merge. \n\nThere are conflicting commits in the target branch.\nThe branch is configured to be mirrored via automated merge. \nThe situation is rare but normal.

But this is ignored by the new dialog. After clicking \"OK\", the predefined orientation thus is lost, only the setting in the dialog is applied.\n\n**Problem 2:**\nThere is no way to populate the page preview box to the right. This is actually an unnecessary feature for me, as it happens for me when using a commercial reporting tool which provides a page preview control. In this control, the \"print\" button just shows the printer selection dialog, and page setup (e.g. orientation) is done in other controls).\n\n\nThe easiest way to resolve this is probably to set the registry key \"Computer\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Print\\UnifiedPrintDialog\\PreferLegacyPrintDialog\" = 1 (see e.g. https://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?901260-The-modern-print-dialog-issue-after-Windows-11-22H2-update).\nThis brings back the old dialog.\n\nWould it be possible to add a property to \"PrintDialog\" similar to \"UseEXDialog\" which enables/disables the Win11 form? This would resolve the issue for me, as I cannot populate the page preview in my app.\n\nI assume this issue is already known, but I did not find anything in this repository.\n\nSimilar issue for WPF: https://www.github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/8355\n\n\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nAttached is a small sample: \n[WinFormsPrintDialog.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19644250/WinFormsPrintDialog.zip)\n\nYou can set landscape/portrait with two radio buttons, then click the \"Print Dialog\" button => now the new dialog should be shown which is always set to \"landscape\".\n\nIf you set the registry key \"Computer\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Print\\UnifiedPrintDialog\\PreferLegacyPrintDialog\" = 1 and perform the same steps, you should see that the landscape setting is applied to the printer settings. So, it worked in the old version of the form.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/13264","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Support for the Win11 22H2 UnifiedPrintDialog\" (#13264)"},{"Id":"2978598837","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-08T06:48:37","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"13263","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\n\n[marker]: <> (Begin:b9a1a4bb-2302-4987-3b3d-08d8b8050dda)\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\n- **Subscription**: [b9a1a4bb-2302-4987-3b3d-08d8b8050dda](https://maestro.dot.net/subscriptions?search=b9a1a4bb-2302-4987-3b3d-08d8b8050dda)\n- **Build**: [20250407.4](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build/results?buildId=2681473)\n- **Date Produced**: April 7, 2025 8:03:01 PM UTC\n- **Commit**: [6bcab7722ffc02d9a9f64e736d06bb4e4a04a94b](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/commit/6bcab7722ffc02d9a9f64e736d06bb4e4a04a94b)\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\n\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\n\n- **Updates**:\n  -

This proposal adds a simple API to WinForms that allows developers to prevent their forms and controls from being captured in screenshots, addressing a critical security concern for applications that handle sensitive data.\n\n## Rationale\nModern productivity tools increasingly use continuous screen capturing to feed content to LLMs for summarization, analysis, and automation. While this offers productivity benefits, it creates significant security risks for certain Line of Business (LOB) applications that handle sensitive data, or at least certain areas of those apps.\n\nHere are a few thoughts, which types of applications might require protection against unauthorized screen captures:\n\n1. **Healthcare Applications**: Applications displaying patient records, medical histories, test results, or other protected health information (PHI) covered under HIPAA regulations\n   \n2. **Financial Applications**: Banking software, investment platforms, or accounting systems showing account balances, transaction histories, credit card numbers, or tax information\n   \n3. **Government Systems**: Applications handling citizen data, social security numbers, tax records, or classified information\n   \n4. **Legal Software**: Case management systems containing privileged attorney-client communications, court filings, or sensitive legal strategies\n   \n5. **Insurance Platforms**: Systems displaying policy details, claims information, or personal policyholder data\n   \n6. **HR Software**: Applications showing employee records, salary information, performance reviews, or personal details\n   \n7. **Educational Systems**: Applications containing student records, grades, or other information protected under FERPA\n\n## Proposed API\n\nWindows 10/11 provides the `SetWindowDisplayAffinity` API with the `WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE` flag that can block most software-based screen capture methods. This proposal wraps this functionality in a simple, easy-to-use WinForms API that raises awareness about this security concern and gives developers a straightforward way to protect sensitive information.\n\n### New Property for Form Class\n```csharp\n/// <summary>\n/// Gets or sets a value indicating whether this form should be excluded from screen captures.\n/// When set to true, the form will appear blacked out in screenshots and screen recordings.\n/// This only works on Windows 10 version 1803 and higher.\n/// </summary>\npublic bool ExcludeFromScreenCapture { get; set; }\n```\n\n### New Property for Control Class\n```csharp\n/// <summary>\n/// Gets or sets a value indicating whether this control should be excluded from screen captures.\n/// When set to true, the control will appear blacked out in screenshots and screen recordings.\n/// This only works on Windows 10 version 1803 and higher and only applies to controls\n/// that have their own HWND handle.\n/// </summary>\npublic bool ExcludeFromScreenCapture { get; set; }\n```\n\n### Additional Supporting APIs\n```csharp\n/// <summary>\n/// Enumeration defining the behavior when a form or control is captured in a screenshot.\n/// </summary>\npublic enum ScreenCaptureMode\n{\n    /// <summary>\n    /// The form or control can be captured normally in screenshots.\n    /// </summary>\n    Allow = 0,\n    \n    /// <summary>\n    /// The form or control appears blacked out in screenshots.\n    /// </summary>\n    Exclude = 1,\n    \n    /// <summary>\n    /// The form or control appears blurred in screenshots.\n    /// Requires Windows 11 version 22H2 or higher.\n    /// </summary>\n    Blur = 2\n}\n\n/// <summary>\n/// Gets or sets the behavior of this form when included in screen captures.\n/// </summary>\npublic ScreenCaptureMode ScreenCaptureMode { get; set; }\n\n/// <summary>\n/// Event that fires when a screen capture is detected.\n/// </summary>\npublic event EventHandler ScreenCaptureAttempted;\n```\n\n### New Form Configuration in Visual Studio Designer\nAdd a \"Security\" category in the Properties panel of the WinForms designer with the `ExcludeFromScreenCapture` property for easy discovery and configuration.\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- Assumingly pretty straight forward, low risk, low hanging fruit overall with substantial benefit/impact for customers.\n\n## Limitations/Discussion points\n- This protection only works on Windows 10 version 1803 and higher\n- It of course doesn't prevent hardware-based screen captures (e.g., taking a photo of the screen), which need to be clearly stated in the API docs, along, that this can help securing data but not totally prevent it.\n- Some security monitoring tools may need exceptions to function properly\n- The protection applies at the window level and may not be granular enough for all scenarios\n\n## Benefits\n- Simple API that's easy for developers to adopt\n- Raises awareness about an important security consideration\n- Provides immediate protection against many common screen capture methods\n- Aligns with the \"secure by default\" principle by making security features easily accessible\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/13258","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[API Suggestion][Security] Add ExcludeFromScreenCapture API to Forms/Controls\" (#13258)"},{"Id":"2976121029","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-07T08:54:45","Actor":"Olina-Zhang","Number":"13257","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add code coverage for FlowLayoutPanelDesigner.cs file","State":"open","Body":"Related https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/10773\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\n- Add unit test file: FlowLayoutPanelDesignerTests.cs for public method and 6 protected methods of the FlowLayoutPanelDesigner.cs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/13257)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/13257","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add code coverage for FlowLayoutPanelDesigner.cs file\" (#13257)"},{"Id":"2976113155","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-07T08:51:51","Actor":"Syareel-Sukeri","Number":"13256","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add code coverage for ToolStripContainerActionList","State":"open","Body":"Related https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/10773\r\n\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\n- Add unit test ToolStripContainerActionListTests.cs for public properties and method of the ToolStripContainerActionList.\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/13256)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/13256","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add code coverage for ToolStripContainerActionList\" (#13256)"},{"Id":"2975857065","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-04-07T07:12:54","Actor":"TechnVision","Number":"13254","RawContent":null,"Title":"Random error is thrown at runtime ","State":"open","Body":"### .NET version\n\n.net 8, WinForms\n\n### Did it work in .NET Framework?\n\nYes\n\n### Did it work in any of the earlier releases of .NET Core or .NET 5+?\n\nThe App works file without any code changes since .net 6.\n\n### Issue description\n\nThe exception unknown software exception 0xx0434352 occurred in the app at location 0x000007FF919E41B39\n\n\nWhy is this error thrown at random places in runtime.

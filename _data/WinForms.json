There are significant resources attached however, including a demo project, control dlls, and video showing the issue.\r\n\r\nEffectively, this worked without any issue in prior versions of Visual Studio.\r\n\r\nVisual Studio 17.5 seemingly introduced a change in how references were handled, where it automatically attempts to add a reference when a control is dragged onto a form.  If the reference is already added however, the control cannot be added and generates an error that the reference is already added to the project.  This then makes the software unuseable as you must delete the reference between each and every new control that you add to the form and the form designer then cannot display the form if the reference is removed...\r\n\r\nCan this please be corrected?  It is a serious issue.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nOpen a form in the designer.\r\n\r\nDrag a 3rd party control to the form. This then adds a reference to the dll to the project.\r\n\r\nTry to add another control from the same 3rd party control library to the form.  This now generates an error that the control library was already added as a reference and refuses to allow you to add the control to the form.\r\n\r\nDelete the reference to the control library.\r\n\r\nDrag a 3rd party control to the form.  This works and again adds a reference to the dll to the project.\r\n\r\nTry to add another control from the same 3rd party control library to the form.  This now again generates an error that the control library was already added as a reference and refuses again to allow you to add the control to the form.\n\n### Diagnostics\n\n```text\nI believe this is caused by a change in the way Visual Studio 17.5 and 17.5.1 attempt to add references automatically when you add a control to a form / project.  If the reference is already added, Visual Studio should not then attempt to add it again and should not generate an error or refuse to allow you to add the control.\n```\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/8780","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Visual Studio 17.5 and 17.5.1 issues with 3rd party Controls\" (#8780)"},{"Id":"1624337032","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-14T21:38:03","Actor":"dreddy-work","Number":"8810","RawContent":null,"Title":"[Tracking] Replace InputSimulator with alternative in tests to make them reliable.","State":"open","Body":"While investigating flaky tests that perform operation on the UI, we found InputSimulator used in tests is not reliable in clearing the input message queue and ensuring the operation is successfully performed.

The new API [`SHGetStockIconInfo`](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shgetstockiconinfo) is the way to get the _current_ version of icons used in dialogs, etc.\r\n\r\nProviding a new method in `SystemIcons` would allow getting updated versions of icons and allow access to a number of additional icons. It additionally allows getting small icon versions, highlighted versions, link versions, etc.\r\n\r\n### API Proposal\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nnamespace System.Drawing;\r\n\r\npublic static class SystemIcons\r\n{\r\n    /// <summary>\r\n    ///  Gets the specified stock shell icon.\r\n    /// </summary>\r\n    public static Icon GetStockIcon(StockIcon stockIcon);\r\n    public static Icon GetStockIcon(StockIcon stockIcon, StockIconOptions options);\r\n}\r\n\r\n[Flags]\r\npublic enum StockIconOptions\r\n{\r\n    SmallIcon = 0x000000001,\r\n    ShellIconSize = 0x000000004,\r\n    LinkOverlay = 0x000008000,\r\n    Selected = 0x000010000,\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Matching https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/shellapi/ne-shellapi-shstockiconid with\r\n// Pascal casing and no abbreviations (\"Assoc\" to \"Associations\"), will still keep acronyms (CD, not CompactDisc).\r\npublic enum StockIcon\r\n{\r\n    DocumentNoAssociation = 0,\r\n    DocumentWithAssociation = 1,\r\n    Application = 2,\r\n    Folder = 3,\r\n    OpenFolder = 4,\r\n    Drive525 = 5,\r\n    Drive35 = 6,\r\n    DriveRemovable = 7,\r\n    DriveFixed = 8,\r\n    DriveNetwork = 9,\r\n    DriveNetworkDisabled = 10,\r\n    DriveCD = 11,\r\n    DriveRAM = 12,\r\n    World = 13,\r\n    Server = 15,\r\n    Printer = 16,\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### API Usage\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing Icon icon = SystemIcons.GetStockIcon(StockIcon.Shield);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Alternative Designs\r\n\r\nWe could update the existing methods to use the current icons but:\r\n\r\n- Some applications will depend on the legacy icon look\r\n- There are over 90 stock icons (and growing)\r\n\r\nWe could also put the static method in `StockIcons`, but that would make discoverability more difficult. Could potentially add to 'Icon'?\r\n\r\n### Risks\r\n\r\n_No response_","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/8802","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[API Proposal]: Add ability to get modern Windows icons to System.Drawing.SystemIcons.\" (#8802)"},{"Id":"1619439869","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-03-10T19:42:59","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"8778","RawContent":null,"Title":"Localized file check-in by OneLocBuild Task: Build definition ID 164: Build ID 2132587","State":"closed","Body":"This is the pull request automatically created by the OneLocBuild task in the build process to check-in localized files generated based upon translation source files (.lcl files) handed-back from the downstream localization pipeline.

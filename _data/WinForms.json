loop","State":"closed","Body":"While fiddling with hosting VB6 controls I hit asserts regarding the message window changing unicode/ansi state.

However, I noticed that for certain reference and value type resources extracted from the assembly into the dictionary, such as Int32, System.Drawing.Size, System.String and others,  the type information returned by GetType() for the resources in the dictionary corresponds to that of the executing runtime, in this case, .NET7, whereas the assembly itself targets .NET6.\r\n\r\nThis is causing problems after I create the satellite assemblies, because when the newly localised assembly is trying to load the localised resources, it throws exceptions saying that binary serialization is not supported. I think this is a red herring, because when I looked into it further, the types that the runtime is trying to load from the satellite assembly are .NET7 types, so the .NET 6 runtime is unable to load those types.\r\n\r\nAny help appreciated,\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nUse ResourceReader to extract a dictionary of resources a .NET6 assembly, using .NET7.\r\nIterate over that dictionary and call GetType for each entry. \r\nYou will see that each entry's type information corresponds to .NET7 types:\r\n\r\n```\r\nStream ReadStream = myAssembly.GetManifestResourceStream(strAssemblyName);\r\n\r\nif(null != ReadStream)\r\n{\r\n   using (DeserializingResourceReader reader = new DeserializingResourceReader(ReadStream))\r\n   {\r\n      foreach (DictionaryEntry entry in reader)\r\n      {\r\n\tSystem.Type vValueType = entry.Value.GetType();\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/8180","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Calling GetType on resource from loaded assembly returns type from currently executing runtime version, not the assembly target runtime version\" (#8180)"},{"Id":"1446294952","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-12T06:49:18","Actor":"gpetrou","Number":"8174","RawContent":null,"Title":"Enable nullability in some ToolStripItem members","State":"open","Body":"## Proposed changes\r\n\r\n- Enable nullability in some ToolStripItem members.\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/api/codeflow?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/8174)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/8174","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Enable nullability in some ToolStripItem members\" (#8174)"},{"Id":"1445878773","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2022-11-11T20:02:32","Actor":"dreddy-work","Number":"8171","RawContent":null,"Title":"GridError dialog missing AutoScaleDimensions property","State":"closed","Body":"GridError dialog is missing `AutoScaleDimension` property resulting in default scale factor `1`.

I don't know for sure if it does, but I wanted to let you know so you can review it.\r\n\r\nWine Mono uses a fork of .NET Core winforms running under Mono. When I most recently merged upstream Mono, I found that it introduced crashes running MonoTests.System.Windows.Forms.TimerTest from Mono's unit tests. This happens when the NativeWindow class is finalized. It turns out that when the _windowProc delegate is only referenced by objects that are being finalized, calling it from native code can crash, or it can result in the instance method being called with this == NULL.\r\n\r\nI don't know if there's an easy way to run this test in .NET Core, I've only built it to run in .NET Framework.\r\n\r\nI am working around this by ensuring that any active WndProc delegates have a static reference to them. That change is https://github.com/madewokherd/winforms/commit/a0bc4ebd64afbac01116a8dee0551250fc56202b but I didn't write it with the intention of sending it upstream.\r\n\r\nDoes the .NET Core runtime provide the needed guarantees that a delegate will function while it is referenced by a cycle that includes objects being finalized?

Instead of sharing ImageLists this PR creates an explicit duplicate when assigning an ImageList to the native control, and destroys the previous instance. This guarantees the handle used by the native control is always unique and can be safely destroyed. To avoid leaks all ImageLists are removed when the handle is destroyed.\r\n\r\n#3531 is tracking proper implementation of ImageList ownership\r\n\r\nFor TreeViews the StateImageList is never shareable and it had similar bugs, so the correct solution is also to create unique handles and destroy them.

is 40 chars or less, this leaves MAX_PATH - 1 - 40 chars for the path that we see in the GH (portion from src to .cs). This test enforces this limit be enumerating all repo files, getting the full path length and comparing this length against the maximim. Maximum full path length should be compensated for repo roots that are shorter than 40.\r\n\r\n```\r\nMaxRootLength + <relative path to the file>.Length < 259\r\nMaxRootLength + <full path to the file>.Length  - currentRootLength  < 259\r\n<full path to the file>.Length  < 259 - MaxRootLength + currentRootLength  \r\n```\r\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11882)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11882","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"belated feedback on https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11835/\" (#11882)"},{"Id":"2466817905","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-14T21:31:25","Actor":"lonitra","Number":"11881","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/9.0] Publish APIs for 9.0 RC1 (#11879)","State":"closed","Body":"do not squash merge\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11881)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11881","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/9.0] Publish APIs for 9.0 RC1 (#11879)\" (#11881)"},{"Id":"2466816199","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-14T21:31:25","Actor":"lonitra","Number":"11880","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/9.0-rc1] Publish APIs for 9.0 RC1 (#11879)","State":"closed","Body":"do not squash merge\r\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11880)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11880","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/9.0-rc1] Publish APIs for 9.0 RC1 (#11879)\" (#11880)"},{"Id":"2466754127","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-14T20:57:20","Actor":"lonitra","Number":"11879","RawContent":null,"Title":"Publish APIs for 9.0 RC1","State":"closed","Body":"ran `.\\eng\\ApiCompatibility\\mark-shipped.cmd`\r\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11879)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11879","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Publish APIs for 9.0 RC1\" (#11879)"},{"Id":"2466481248","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-14T19:29:50","Actor":"lonitra","Number":"11878","RawContent":null,"Title":"Fix AxHosts.csproj build errors with Preview 7 SDK","State":"closed","Body":"Related: https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/42699\r\n\r\nImplemented [suggestion](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/42699#issuecomment-2288280126) to resolve build error when moving to use Preview 7 SDK\r\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11878)\r\n ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11878","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Fix AxHosts.csproj build errors with Preview 7 SDK\" (#11878)"},{"Id":"2466336403","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-08-14T18:50:56","Actor":"dotnet-bot","Number":"11877","RawContent":null,"Title":"Localized file check-in by OneLocBuild Task: Build definition ID 164: Build ID 2515457","State":"closed","Body":"This is the pull request automatically created by the OneLocBuild task in the build process to check-in localized files generated based upon translation source files (.lcl files) handed-back from the downstream localization pipeline.

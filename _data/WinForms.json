App developer is not blocked by the lack of accessible name here. The standard way to associate an accessible name with a control\r\n- is to place a label (a control with Text property) in front of this control in the tab order. Then AccessibleObject.Name will read it;\r\n- the next option for app developer is to actually set trackBar1.AccessibleName = \"descriptive name\".\r\nAs suggested in #2820 , accessible name is a synonym of ControlType. ControlType = Slider; AccessibleName = TrackBar. This is not helpful, as name should not contain ControlType.  We are providing Names for controls that are not exposed to the developer, trackBar does not fit this case. \r\n\r\nOn other hand app developer may forget to set AccessibleName or place a Label in front of a Control. In this case an app user must not suffer. Anyway, an app developer can set some accessible name as an empty string if it is necessary for him. The explanation can be found in #2382 \r\n\r\nThere are several issues with default accessible names that are synonymous to control types.\r\n1. It does not produce accessible applications by default. Consider the following UI:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23213980/74722923-c5559800-524a-11ea-9cde-1dc568b24326.png)\r\nLooking at the image above, do you know what value to enter into this control? What will it be used for?\r\nIt seems that an AT user will not know what to do with control of type Spinner that is named \"Numeric\" because this name does not explain what value the number in the control represents.\r\n\r\nSuch a name does not solve the problem that Accessible Name property is designed to solve, it does not explain business logic behind this control. This solution will not improve applications of accessibility of the our framework.\r\n\r\n2. An application developer has a smaller chance to fix the above mentioned accessibility issue in this application because we suppressed AI error report.\r\nThe suggestion here is that this is an application developer responsibility to provide meaningful Accessible names and responsibility of AI tool to teach the developer how to write accessible applications. Role of the framework developer is to provide public API that allows app developer to set a meaningful accessible name. We provide hard-coded accessible names only for UI elements that don't expose public APIs to the app developers. \r\n\r\nApplication developers should to make applications accessible. We are not enforcing keyboard shortcuts or taborder either, because these depend on the business logic.\r\n\r\nTaking into account above considerations, we have two points here:\r\n- AccesibleName is for business naming which will provide the information about the business purpose of the control.\r\n- AccessibleControlType is for providing Framework control type.\r\n\r\nLike in the following example: 'Age NumericUpDown' \r\n-- where 'Age' is an AccessibleName which should be provided by application developer and is not Framework developer responsibility (it seems that by default an empty accessible name should be provided for both Numeric and Domain UpDown controls,)\r\n-- and 'NumericUpDown' is the localized control type that is the Framework developer responsibility as Framework developers provide the set of control types and thereby should provide localized accessible control types for each available control.\r\nSo it seems that we need to start the work here to ensure that WinForms controls API does not provide accessible names as these should be application-related business-specific accessible names and should not copy the control type name or its part to accessible name (keep it blank). And on the other hand Framework developers need to provide meaningful localized control types for all controls.  And the result of this work should be like this:\r\n\"\" TextBox\r\n\"\" CombBox\r\n\"\" Numeric UpDown\r\n\"\" Domain UpDown\r\n\"\" Property Grid\r\nand so on\r\nand application developers will implement accessible names in their application to have something like this:\r\n\"First name\" TextBox\r\n\"Occupation\" ComboBox\r\n\"Age\" Numeric UpDown\r\n\"Rating\" Domain UpDown\r\n\"Skills\" Property Grid\r\nand so on\r\n\r\n**Proposed changes and expected behavior:**\r\n- Need to show error by AI if application developer does not provide business specific accessible name. So we need to make Accessible names empty for the controls exposed to developers.\r\n- Accessible names of the controls which are not public should not be empty.\r\n\r\n**Minimal repro:**\r\n- Create the app with WinForms controls and ensure that by default Accessible names are empty and localized control types show the control type specific names.\r\n- Accessible names can be set via control API (AccessibleName property) or by adding the label before the control.\r\n- Control child elements should not have default accessible names or accessible names which contain control type names.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/2870","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"AccessibleName default values for WinForms Controls\" (#2870)"},{"Id":"566631748","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-02-18T04:03:35","Actor":"Tanya-Solyanik","Number":"2869","RawContent":null,"Title":"Read Name property instead of name field when serializing ColumnHeader.Name ","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please read CONTRIBUTING.md before submitting a pull request -->\r\n\r\nFixes #2867 \r\n\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThe `name` field is not set in this code, however it is read in ShouldSerializeName.

Typically now, you start with the default WinForms template, which runs everything on the GUI thread. I believe most people usually run with this instead of spawning other threads for work.

A dialog's state can include factors such as the last visited folder and the position and size of the dialog. Typically, this state is persisted based on the name of the executable file. By specifying a GUID, an application can have different persisted states for different versions of the dialog within the same application (for example, an import dialog and an open dialog).\r\n\r\nExposing `IFileDialog::SetClientGuid` is in line with one of the aims which the [contributing guide](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/blob/master/Documentation/contributing.md) calls out for .NET 5.0 and beyond:\r\n\r\n> [U]pdate implementations to deliver all aspects of modern Windows UI, including missings properties or actions\r\n\r\n### API proposal\r\n\r\nDraft implementation: https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/2859\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace System.Windows.Forms\r\n{\r\n    public abstract partial class FileDialog : CommonDialog\r\n    {\r\n        // Public instance properties\r\n        public bool AddExtension { get; set; }\r\n        public virtual bool CheckFileExists { get; set; }\r\n        public bool CheckPathExists { get; set; }\r\n+       public System.Guid? ClientGuid { get; set; }\r\n        public string DefaultExt { get; set; }\r\n        public bool DereferenceLinks { get; set; }\r\n        public string FileName { get; set; }\r\n        public string[] FileNames { get; }\r\n        public string Filter { get; set; }\r\n        public int FilterIndex { get; set; }\r\n        public string InitialDirectory { get; set; }\r\n        public bool RestoreDirectory { get; set; }\r\n        public bool ShowHelp { get; set; }\r\n        public bool SupportMultiDottedExtensions { get; set; }\r\n        public bool Title { get; set; }\r\n        public bool ValidateNames { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Lack of alternatives\r\n\r\nWe were recently in a situation where the use case fit the SetClientGuid concept perfectly. In our plugin for an application which is not published by us, our file dialogs needed to track and open to a last-used import directory without affecting the initial directory of the existing file dialogs across the base application. The base application doesn't set the initial directory when it shows a file dialog. Windows shares the state of all dialogs which have no client GUID across the whole app. The only way to keep our dialogs from overwriting the last-used directory for all the dialogs across the base application was to use SetClientGuid.\r\n\r\nBecause Windows Forms does not expose this capability, nor does it even provide a hook we could use to obtain the object instance to make COM calls on, I ended up taking a few hours and implementing our own file dialog library with a ClientGuid property.\r\n\r\n📝 If we were in a situation where we had control over the code in the base application that showed file dialogs, one alternative would be to save and restore FileDialog.InitialDirectory to two separate storage locations. This feels more like a hack than idiomatic use of the Windows file dialog feature.\r\n\r\n### Template questions\r\n\r\n> Will this feature affect UI controls?\r\n\r\n**Yes**, Windows saves and restores initial directory and dialog screen position with the application name as the key. This feature would enable opting in to using an arbitrary GUID as the key instead of the application name.\r\n\r\n> Will VS Designer need to support the feature? If yes, describe how you expect it to funсtion.\r\n\r\n**No**, `[Browsable(false)]` should be fine.

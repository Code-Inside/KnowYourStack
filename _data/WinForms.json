We originally discovered this while investigating a GDI Object leak, which is a manifestation of the container never getting collected.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\nThe attached projects demonstrate the issue by tracking when the container is constructed, disposed and finalized. The three projects are:\n_ActiveXControl_MFC_ - an MFC project that builds an ocx; the post-build step registers it (requires Visual Studio 2022 run as admin) and creates an interop assembly\n_AxHostContainer_ - a .NET 8 project that contains the AxHost\n_AxHostContainer_Framework48_ - a .NET Framework 4.8 project that contains the AxHost\nThe AxHostContainer projects are identical, except for the targeted .NET platform.\n\nRunning AxHostContainer apps: \nThe AxHostContainer apps effectively execute four cases, two on .NET 8 and the same two repeated on .NET Framework 4.8. Each of the four cases open and close a Form multiple times.\n```\n\tWithout AxHost\tWith AxHost\n.NET 8        +             x\n.NET FW       +             +\n```\nOnly the .NET 8 With AxHost case exhibits the bad behavior where the finalizers fail to execute.\n\n[AxHostLeak.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20367779/AxHostLeak.zip)\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/13499","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"AxHost keeping parent alive\" (#13499)"},{"Id":"3079613850","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-21T09:44:32","Actor":"MelonWang1","Number":"13498","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add code coverage for UpDownBase.UpDownBaseAccessibleObject","State":"open","Body":"Related #13442\r\n\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\n- Add unit test file: UpDownBase.UpDownBaseAccessibleObjectTests.cs for public methods of the UpDownBase.UpDownBaseAccessibleObject.cs.cs\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/13498)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/13498","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add code coverage for UpDownBase.UpDownBaseAccessibleObject\" (#13498)"},{"Id":"3079601875","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-21T09:40:20","Actor":"Philip-Wang01","Number":"13497","RawContent":null,"Title":"Add unit test for GridEntryRecreateChildrenEventArgs.cs file","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please read CONTRIBUTING.md before submitting a pull request -->\r\nRelated https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/13442\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n- Add unit test file: GridEntryRecreateChildrenEventArgsTests.cs for GridEntryRecreateChildrenEventArgs.cs file.\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/13497)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/13497","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Add unit test for GridEntryRecreateChildrenEventArgs.cs file\" (#13497)"},{"Id":"3079366758","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-05-21T08:20:30","Actor":"Sekar47","Number":"13496","RawContent":null,"Title":"Transparent BackColor ignored when OnPaint is overridden in Button-derived controls","State":"open","Body":"### .NET version\n\n.NET Framework 4.8\n\n### Did it work in .NET Framework?\n\nNo\n\n### Did it work in any of the earlier releases of .NET Core or .NET 5+?\n\nNo\n\n### Issue description\n\nWhen creating a custom control that inherits from System.Windows.Forms.Button and overrides the OnPaint method, setting the BackColor property to Color.Transparent does not render a transparent background.

It's quite hard to reproduce it. So, we'll try to present all corresponding info.\n\n---\n\n## Environment\n- Visual studio 17.14\n- .NET 9.0\n- WinForms C# project\n\nAlso (for all tested PC):\n- Windows 10 (latest update)\n- The UAC level doesn't matter\n- App is running under admin\n- The `Run as admin` compatibility flag is set\n- App is located in `C:\\Program files (x86)\\KassArray` directory\n\n---\n\n## Essence of problem\n\nWe have next code (*we think, it is important, where the needed file is located – the* ***OS-protected area*** *in this case*):\n\n```\nprivate void Timer_Tick (object sender, EventArgs e)\n  {\n  Button_Clicked (null, null);\n  }\n\nprivate void Button_Clicked (object sender, EventArgs e)\n  {\n  bool result = File.Exists (\"C:\\\\Program files (x86)\\\\KassArray\\\\PrinterSettings.fsr\");\n  if (result)\n    DoSomethingWithOtherFiles ();\n  }\n```\n\nIn this case `result` gets exactly the expected value when we click `Button` in the app interface. In our tests it was confirmed as `true` on all PCs.\n\nBut the **result becomes random** when the `Timer` ticks. And it doesn't make sence because it's happening **in the same app at the same time**. Under *random* we understand that it somehow depends on the machine where the app is running. Admin rights and UAC lowering don't help.\n\nAlso, `DoSomethingWithOtherFiles` method triggered by `Timer` is still able to access (read and write) files located in \"free\" area (f.e., Desktop or Documents). We've tested it by commenting the `if (result)` line.\n\n---\n\n### Thoughts\nWe know that the `File.Exists` method may return `false` when the file isn't available and when permissions of the app aren't enough to access the file. But we can't apply any of these reasons here.\n\nThe only difference we've found is that OS, where the `result` is `true`, trusts the certificate which has been used to sign the app. And OS, where the `result` is `false`, doesn't trust it. The button clicking gives `true` on both systems.\n\nCan the separated background thread of the timer explain this, may be? Does it have some restrictions?\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nQuite hard to reproduce it.

It adds comprehensive tests to document existing behavior.\n\nKey scenarios validated:\n\n- **Raw Data Access**: Retrieving the raw `MemoryStream` data from the clipboard using `TryGetData<MemoryStream>()`\n- **NRBF Data Access**: Decoding clipboard data to `SerializationRecord` using `TryGetData<SerializationRecord>()`\n- **JSON Serialization**: Proper handling of JSON-serialized data in both in-process and out-of-process scenarios\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nThe existing implementation in `BinaryFormatUtilities.TryReadObjectFromStream<T>` already supports these scenarios:\n\n```csharp\n// Raw data access\nif (typeof(T) == typeof(MemoryStream))\n{\n    // Explicitly asked for a MemoryStream, return the stream as is.\n    @object = (T)(object)stream;\n    return true;\n}\n\n// NRBF serialized data access\nrecord = stream.DecodeNrbf();\nif (typeof(T) == typeof(SerializationRecord))\n{\n    // If SerializationRecord was explicitly requested, return the decoded stream.\n    @object = (T)(object)record;\n    return true;\n}\n```\n\nThe added tests ensure:\n\n1. `TryGetData<MemoryStream>` always returns the raw HGLOBAL data stream\n2. `TryGetData<SerializationRecord>` properly decodes NRBF-formatted data\n3. JSON serialized data works correctly in all API scenarios\n4.

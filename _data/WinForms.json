Since there is no WinForms TLB provided by .NET Core there is no value in keeping this attribute.\r\n- Remove `ComVisible(true)` from `AccessibleObject` classes. They are not CoCreateable (no parameterless constructor) and exposing an already existing instance to COM does not require that attribute.\r\n- Remove `ComVisible(true)` from `Control`/`Component` classes. This was used to allow hosting of WinForms controls via OLE/ActiveX, for example in VB6 or MFC. However this requires a TLB for WinForms which is no longer provided, as well as registry-based activation which also would not work out of the box. Generally there was no maintenance of COM based hosting of WinForms controls so its likely to be broken, therefore removing support for COM based hosting of WinForms controls instead of leaving it in an unsupported state.\r\n  - This commit also removes `ClassInterface` attributes from controls. If hosting via OLE/ActiveX is not supported these attributes are not needed anymore. They are kept in other places where objects are still exposed to COM and the attribute may be relevant.\r\n- Remove `ComVisible(true)` from EventArgs. They were most likely used with OLE/ActiveX hosting, which is no longer supported. They are not CoCreateable either so the attribute has no purpose. Exposing existing instances without providing a TLB makes no sense either.\r\n- Remove `ComVisible(true)` from delegates. Purpose is unknown but since ActiveX hosting of WinForms Controls is no longer supported its unlikely to have any purpose any more.\r\n- Remove `ComVisible(true)` from some non-public code. The only potential consumer would be the new VS designer, but without a GUID specified its unlikely that its still needed. Can provide a GUID if required.\r\n- Remove `ComVisible(true)` from some arbitrary public designer classes. The old VS designer may have been using COM interop to talk to them, but the old designer doesn't support .NET Core so there is most likely no one who needs these ComVisible.\r\n- `IWin32Window` had a conflict with Desktop Framework which has dangerous consequences, see discussion in issue. Resolution can be either removing `ComVisible(true)` if not required ore generating a new GUID not conflicting with Desktop Framework.\r\n- The WinForms managed `IDataObject` was made ComVisible. This is not required, there is a separate ComImport interface declaration for IDataObject COM interop. Having the managed IDataObject being ComVisible is actually counterproductive since no TLB is provided and marshaling will always fail. Also the GUID was not specified and differed from Desktop Framework so its unlikely that removing an undocumented IID will affect customers negatively.\r\n- Remove `ComVisible(false)` - those are placed in seemingly arbitrary places and are redundant when the default is to not expose classes to COM interop (if the default is to expose, then current set of annotations would also be wrong because way too few classes have this annotation)\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\nMay break customers which were doing unsupported COM interop against WinForms. It is unexpected that any exist, if they do it is desireable to gather feedback of what people are doing and then evaluate whether these scenarios are to be supported.\r\n\r\n## Regression? \r\n\r\n**partial**\r\n\r\nThere was one interface which was sharing a GUID with Desktop Framework, `IWin32Window`, this is a conflict that could cause damage. (The regression part is that trying to register an application this way could damage the Desktop Framework installation, see discussion in linked issue.)\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\nassumed low, may be breaking unknown usage patterns\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n\r\n- redundant `ComVisible` attributes\r\n- `ComVisible(true)` attributes without GUID, causing no harm but COM interop not being actively supported either\r\n- conflicts in GUID with Desktop Framework\r\n\r\n### After\r\n\r\n- redundant `ComVisible` removed\r\n- unsupported `ComVisible(true)` removed, may be reconsidered in the future together with what is considered a supported scenario\r\n- resolve all GUID conflicts by generating a separate GUID für .NET Core\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\n- seaching for `ComVisible` in the codebase\r\n- manual evaluation of scenarios (see above)\r\n- **no** automated testing since most of the scenarios were not actively supported\r\n\r\n## Accessibility testing\r\n\r\nNot performed. If removal of `ComVisible` on `AccessibleObject` requires testing to confirm general functionality is maintained this testing has yet to be performed.\r\n\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/3388)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/3388","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Update inappropriate ComVisible attributes\" (#3388)"},{"Id":"629942591","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-03T12:44:58","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"3387","RawContent":null,"Title":"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/runtime","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:be4b0f38-c1d5-43ab-c5d9-08d76fa9c820)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/runtime\r\n- **Subscription**: be4b0f38-c1d5-43ab-c5d9-08d76fa9c820\r\n- **Build**: 20200603.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: 6/3/2020 10:40 AM\r\n- **Commit**: e25517ea27311297c1e3946acb3b4382d5fa7fef\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/master\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **System.CodeDom**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20302.1 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20303.1\r\n  - **System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20302.1 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20303.1\r\n  - **runtime.win-x86.Microsoft.NETCore.ILAsm**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20302.1 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20303.1\r\n  - **runtime.win-x64.Microsoft.NETCore.ILAsm**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20302.1 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20303.1\r\n  - **Microsoft.NET.Sdk.IL**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20302.1 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20303.1\r\n  - **Microsoft.NETCore.App**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20302.1 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20303.1\r\n  - **Microsoft.NETCore.ILAsm**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20302.1 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20303.1\r\n  - **Microsoft.Win32.Registry**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20302.1 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20303.1\r\n  - **Microsoft.Win32.SystemEvents**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20302.1 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20303.1\r\n  - **Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20302.1 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20303.1\r\n  - **System.Drawing.Common**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20302.1 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20303.1\r\n  - **System.Windows.Extensions**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20302.1 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20303.1\r\n  - **System.Security.Cryptography.Cng**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20302.1 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20303.1\r\n  - **System.Security.Permissions**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20302.1 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20303.1\r\n  - **System.Resources.Extensions**: from 5.0.0-preview.7.20302.1 to 5.0.0-preview.7.20303.1\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:be4b0f38-c1d5-43ab-c5d9-08d76fa9c820)\r\n\r\n\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](http://wpcp.azurewebsites.net/CodeFlowProtocolProxy2.php?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/3387)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/3387","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[master] Update dependencies from dotnet/runtime\" (#3387)"},{"Id":"629722706","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-03T07:20:32","Actor":"Wonderdch","Number":"3386","RawContent":null,"Title":"Dead link","State":"closed","Body":"**Problem description:**\r\n\r\nPage: [Designing Forms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/blob/master/Documentation/getting-started.md#designing-forms)\r\nLink: [Windows Forms Designer Documentation.](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/blob/master/Documentation/Documentation/winforms-designer.md)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/3386","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Dead link\" (#3386)"},{"Id":"629290729","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2020-06-03T06:11:18","Actor":"maikebing","Number":"3383","RawContent":null,"Title":"Whether  can reconsider supporting cross-platforms?

`OnColumnHeadersHeightChanged` with \r\n```cs\r\nprotected virtual void OnColumnHeadersHeightChanged(EventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n    if (editingControl != null)\r\n    {\r\n

}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith `OnRowHeadersWidthChanged`\r\n```cs\r\nprotected virtual void OnRowHeadersWidthChanged(EventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n    if (RowHeadersVisible)\r\n    {\r\n        if (editingControl

handle creation, as it guards `UpdateMouseEnteredCell` with `IsHandleCreated`.\r\n\r\nHowever, `OnColumnHeadersHeightChanged` doesn't.\r\n\r\nNot only does this force handle creation when `ColumnHeadersHeight` is set to something custom, but also causes `NREs` and `ObjectDisposedException`, for example\r\n```\r\n  X

To identify who created the control capture a stack trace in the NativeWindow constructor (call `new StackTrace()` and store it as a member).","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/3361","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Missing Control.Dispose calls in unit tests\" (#3361)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2020-06-04T05:30:53.4248877Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":574}

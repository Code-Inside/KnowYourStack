The only difference that it causes an `AccessViolationException` rather than an `ExecutionEngineException`. I think I've found the same issue reported [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-ie/answers/questions/2124572/why-am-i-encountering-a-system-accessviolationexce), but they couldn't provide a reproduction.\n\n### Issue description\n\nChanging the `RightToLeft` property of the `Form` triggered by the `SelectedValueChanged` event of a `ComboBox` may lead to an `ExecutionEngineException` (.NET Framework: `AccessViolationException`).\n\nThe exception does not always occur for the first time, but after a few tries it happens eventually.\n\nThough I haven't performed a deep analysis, the issue may have something to do with the fact that changing `Form.RightToLeft` recreates the whole form, and if it happens when the combo box was dropped down, some Windows messages may be processed on an already freed handle.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nA minimal repro:\n\n**ExceptionFromComboBox.cs:**\n```cs\nusing System;\nusing System.Windows.Forms;\n\nnamespace WindowsFormsApp1\n{\n    public

TaskDialogIcon.","State":"open","Body":"### Background and motivation\n\nI find it a problem that ``TaskDialogIcon`` is missing ``Question`` with no direct *out-of-box* migration path for MessageBox's which use ``MessageBoxIcon.Question``.\n\n**Why not just embed the icon myself?**\nI feel like having to do something like this to get a 1:1 migration path away from the MessageBox API's *could* be simplified further if ``Question`` was added as a property to ``TaskDialogIcon``:\n```cs\ninternal static class MessageBoxIconExtensions\n{\n    internal static TaskDialogIcon ToTaskDialogIcon(this MessageBoxIcon icon)\n        => icon switch\n        {\n            MessageBoxIcon.Question => new(SystemIcons.Question),\n            MessageBoxIcon.Information => TaskDialogIcon.Information,\n            MessageBoxIcon.Warning => TaskDialogIcon.Warning,\n            MessageBoxIcon.Error => TaskDialogIcon.Error,\n            MessageBoxIcon.None => TaskDialogIcon.None,\n            _ => throw new NotSupportedException(\"bug!!!\"),\n        };\n}\n```\n\n### API Proposal\n\n```csharp\nnamespace System.Windows.Forms;\n\npublic class TaskDialogIcon : IDisposable\n{\n    // snipped existing properties for the icons.\n\n    public static readonly TaskDialogIcon Question = new(SystemIcons.Question); // added\n\n    // snipped existing code.\n}\n```\n\n\n### API Usage\n\n```csharp\ninternal static class MessageBoxIconExtensions\n{\n    internal static TaskDialogIcon ToTaskDialogIcon(this MessageBoxIcon icon)\n        => icon switch\n        {\n            MessageBoxIcon.Question => TaskDialogIcon.Question, // <-- new API used here.\n            MessageBoxIcon.Information => TaskDialogIcon.Information,\n            MessageBoxIcon.Warning => TaskDialogIcon.Warning,\n            MessageBoxIcon.Error => TaskDialogIcon.Error,\n            MessageBoxIcon.None => TaskDialogIcon.None,\n            _ => throw new NotSupportedException(\"bug!!!\"),\n        };\n}\n```\nAnd yes I actually use code similar to this in one of my programs and would love to eventually be able to share this piece of code inside of more of them to migrate them to ``TaskDialog`` as a free and cheap upgrade path.\n\n### Alternative Designs\n\nI have not thought of any other alternative API's as I feel that this member to TaskDialogIcon would be the best idea as having a 1:1 migration path for 100% of all use cases for ``MessageBox`` -> ``TaskDialog`` *should* be worth investing in.\n\n### Risks\n\nMinimal as this would help people migrate 100% away from ``MessageBox`` and into ``TaskDialog`` which can be customized much better than ``MessageBox``. Also existing code that uses ``new TaskDialogIcon(SystemIcons.Question)`` can also be detected by the Windows Forms analyzer when used outside of the Windows Forms codebase to then suggest the change to use ``TaskDialogIcon.Question`` instead. Also with this it *could* become possible to then add ``[Obsolete]`` to the ``MessageBox`` class and possibly also remove it from winforms in a future version of .NET in favor of ``TaskDialog`` (on the reference assembly side with the runtime implementation being stubs to ``TaskDialog`` instead to not break existing applications).\n\n### Will this feature affect UI controls?\n\nI do not think this feature would affect any of the UI controls, would need to be localized, or even impact accessibility.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/13670","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"[API Request] Add Question to TaskDialogIcon.\" (#13670)"},{"Id":"3197555117","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-03T00:36:07","Actor":"dotnet-maestro-bot","Number":"13668","RawContent":null,"Title":"[dnceng-bot] Branch `winforms/release/9.0` can't be merged to Azdo internal branch","State":"open","Body":"Branch [release/9.0](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/commits/release/9.0/) in `dotnet/winforms` repo can't be mirrored from GitHub to Azure [internal/release/9.0](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_git/dotnet-winforms?version=GBinternal%2Frelease%2F9.0&_a=history) via internal merge. \n\nThere are conflicting commits in the target branch.\nThe branch is configured to be mirrored via automated merge. \nThe situation is rare but normal.

Create a WinForms project in .NET 9.0\n2. Add a `Panel` (or custom control like `AKNPanel`) inside a `TableLayoutPanel` or other container\n3. Add some child controls (TextBox, Label, etc.) into the panel\n4. Save and close the form, or drag the container accidentally\n5. Reopen the form — the `Panel` may vanish entirely, and all its controls are lost in the `.Designer.cs` file\n\n---\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe Designer should:\n- Show a **warning** before silently removing controls\n- Prevent unintended container deletions\n- Or support an **undo/rollback** if a container and its children are removed\n\n---\n\n\n\n### Environment\n\n- **Visual Studio**: 2022 v17.10.x\n- **.NET SDK**: .NET 9.0 Preview\n- **Project type**: WinForms Desktop App (.NET Core)\n- **Designer Version**: WinForms Core Designer\n\n---\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis issue seems to occur more often:\n- After migrating from .NET Framework to .NET Core\n- When using nested controls or layout containers\n- When editing `.Designer.cs` and `.cs` manually or via copy-paste\n- Without Git or source control, it becomes hard to detect data loss\n\nPlease improve Designer reliability and add safety checks to avoid silent deletion.\n\n\n\n### .NET version\n\nNot net core 9.0\n\n### Did this work in a previous version of Visual Studio and/or previous .NET release?\n\n_No response_\n\n### Issue description\n\nn a WinForms project targeting .NET 9.0 (migrated from .NET Framework), sometimes controls such as `Panel`, `TableLayoutPanel`, or custom user controls (e.g., `AKNPanel`) are **silently deleted from the Designer** when editing forms — especially inside nested containers.\n\nThe Visual Studio Designer removes the control and all its children, but:\n- There is **no warning**\n- The project **compiles without errors**\n- The user might not notice until runtime\n\nThis leads to **data loss and UI breakage**, especially in large migrated solutions.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nn a WinForms project targeting .NET 9.0 (migrated from .NET Framework), sometimes controls such as `Panel`, `TableLayoutPanel`, or custom user controls (e.g., `AKNPanel`) are **silently deleted from the Designer** when editing forms — especially inside nested containers.\n\nThe Visual Studio Designer removes the control and all its children, but:\n- There is **no warning**\n- The project **compiles without errors**\n- The user might not notice until runtime\n\nThis leads to **data loss and UI breakage**, especially in large migrated solutions.\n\n### Diagnostics\n\n```text\nn a WinForms project targeting .NET 9.0 (migrated from .NET Framework), sometimes controls such as `Panel`, `TableLayoutPanel`, or custom user controls (e.g., `AKNPanel`) are **silently deleted from the Designer** when editing forms — especially inside nested containers.\n\nThe Visual Studio Designer removes the control and all its children, but:\n- There is **no warning**\n- The project **compiles without errors**\n- The user might not notice until runtime\n\nThis leads to **data loss and UI breakage**, especially in large migrated solutions.\n```","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/13649","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"WinForms Designer in .NET 9.0 silently removes controls like Panel without warning during editing\" (#13649)"},{"Id":"3178493223","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-06-26T09:37:29","Actor":"shindepra","Number":"13656","RawContent":null,"Title":"Screen Reader is not announcing any information for \"Progress Bar\" present on Common Control 2 page: A11y_WinForms.NETRuntime_CommonControl2_InfoAndRelationships.","State":"open","Body":"\"Please do not close this bug.

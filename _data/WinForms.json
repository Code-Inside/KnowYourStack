Any test that deals with this class, even just create this object alone, will fail. `ZWebBrowser` only add extra keys handlers, so I don't think it causes the un-GC issue above. \n\nWe know that `WebBrowser` is advised against, however, due to resources issue, we cannot abandon it.\n\nHere is the memory profiler result on .NET core 8, showing that the inner class `WebBrowserSite` and `WebBrowserEvent` have (strong) [RefCounted handle](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/dotmemory/Analyzing_GC_Roots.html#refcounted-handle) root, which does not let them get garbage collected. In .NET framework 4.8, these roots are [Weak, RefCounted handle](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/dotmemory/Analyzing_GC_Roots.html#weak-handle)\n\n<img width=\"1510\" height=\"1419\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc32d398-b18f-4dcb-bdf5-9acfcb994da0\" />\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\nBased on the test below, the wrapped `WebBrowser` object is garbage collected:\n- NOT successfully in .NET Core 8.0 and 9.0\n- successfully in .NET Core 7.0 + .NET Framework 4.8.1\n\n```csharp\n\nusing System.Runtime.CompilerServices;\n\n\nnamespace WinFormsTest\n{\n    public static class WebBrowserTests\n    {\n        public static void TestRunLeak()\n        {\n            var browserWeakRef = CreateWebBrowser();\n\n            GC.Collect();\n            GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();\n            GC.Collect();\n           \n            var isBrowserGC = !browserWeakRef.IsAlive;\n\n            // NET CORE 8.0+: isBrowserGC is false;\n            // NET CORE 7.0: isBrowserGC is true;\n            // NET Framework 4.8: isBrowserGC is true;\n        }\n\n        [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]\n        static WeakReference CreateWebBrowser()\n        {\n            using (var browser = new System.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser())\n            {\n                browser.Navigate(\"about:blank\");\n                return new WeakReference(browser);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n### Extra\nWhen diffing the .NET 7.0 and 8.0 source code, this code looks suspicious\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/winforms/blob/e9badd948720225f73defcafa0bccac3011b3256/src/System.Windows.Forms/src/System/Windows/Forms/WebBrowserBase.cs#L690C43-L690C54\n","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/13769","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"System.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser memory leak issue\" (#13769)"},{"Id":"3279859310","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-31T10:05:34","Actor":"LeafShi1","Number":"13768","RawContent":null,"Title":"Skip unstable test ListView_Click_On_Second_Column_Does_Not_Alter_CheckBoxesAsync","State":"open","Body":"<!-- Please read CONTRIBUTING.md before submitting a pull request -->\r\n\r\nFixes #13291 \r\n\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\n- Disable unstable case `ListView_Click_On_Second_Column_Does_Not_Alter_CheckBoxesAsync`\r\n\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/13768)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/13768","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Skip unstable test ListView_Click_On_Second_Column_Does_Not_Alter_CheckBoxesAsync\" (#13768)"},{"Id":"3279666299","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-07-31T08:58:38","Actor":"Olina-Zhang","Number":"13767","RawContent":null,"Title":"Dark Mode: Insufficient contrast for focusing items in CheckedListBox/PropertyGrid","State":"open","Body":"### .NET version\n\n.NET 10 SDK build: 10.0.100-preview.7.25380.105\n\n### Did it work in .NET Framework?\n\nNot tested/verified\n\n### Did it work in any of the earlier releases of .NET Core or .NET 5+?\n\nOccurs when DarkMode feature involved\n\n### Issue description\n\nWhen the application is in Dark Mode, the contrast of focusing items in CheckedListBox/PropertyGrid is insufficient. \nThis issue does not occur in Classic Mode.\n\n**Dark Mode:**\n\n<img width=\"452\" height=\"202\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15cb8ee3-c58b-4af6-b75d-50fe5bcae355\" />\n\n<img width=\"1752\" height=\"1214\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e840cba0-58d4-4738-9d40-dd9405f516fd\" />\n\n**Classic Mode:**\n\n<img width=\"1045\" height=\"480\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af8558e2-a15a-4278-a580-a0b55680f80e\" />\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

All drag-and-drop operations add controls to the root UserControl, not the design-surface-exposed panel, unless the Document Outline is used.\n\n**This worked as expected in .NET Framework 4.8.1,** where clicking the internal panel selected it for control drops.  \n**In .NET 9, this is broken** and makes composite control design much harder.\n\n---\n\n### Minimal Repro\n\n### Steps to Reproduce\n\n1. Add the following minimal UserControl and designer to a .NET WinForms project:\n\n    ```csharp\n    using System.ComponentModel;\n    using System.Windows.Forms;\n    using System.Windows.Forms.Design;\n\n    [Designer(typeof(DemoPanelDesigner))]\n    public class DemoPanel : UserControl\n    {\n        private readonly Panel _contentPanel = new Panel();\n\n        public DemoPanel()\n        {\n            _contentPanel.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;\n            this.Controls.Add(_contentPanel);\n        }\n\n        [Browsable(true)]\n        [DesignerSerializationVisibility(DesignerSerializationVisibility.Content)]\n        public Panel ContentPanel => _contentPanel;\n    }\n\n    public class DemoPanelDesigner : ParentControlDesigner\n    {\n        public override void Initialize(IComponent component)\n        {\n            base.Initialize(component);\n\n            if (component is DemoPanel panel)\n                EnableDesignMode(panel.ContentPanel, nameof(DemoPanel.ContentPanel));\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n2. Build the project, open a Form in the designer, and add 'DemoPanel' to it.\n3. Try to drag a Button (or any control) and drop it inside the 'DemoPanel' surface.\n4. Observe the generated code:\n\n    ```csharp\n    // Result:\n    demoPanel1.Controls.Add(this.button1); // added to UserControl.Controls, not ContentPanel.Controls\n    ```\n\n5. Open **Document Outline** (View > Other Windows > Document Outline), select 'ContentPanel', and add a Button again.\n6. Observe that it is now correctly added to the internal panel.\n\n### Expected Behaviour\n\nClicking inside a design-surface-exposed internal panel should select it, and controls dragged in should be added to that panel, **not the root UserControl**.\n\n### Actual Behaviour\n\n- Clicking in the designer surface always selects the UserControl itself.\n- Controls are always added to the root `Controls` collection, even when clicking inside the exposed sub-panel.\n- Only by selecting the sub-panel in Document Outline can controls be added correctly.\n\n### Why this Matters\n\n- Breaks the designer experience for any composite/custom controls.\n- Causes confusion, misplaced controls, and wasted developer time.\n- No obvious fix/workaround except using Document Outline, which is not discoverable or intuitive for most developers.\n\n### Environment\n\n- .NET 9 (also occurs in .NET 6/7/8, .NET Framework 4.8.1)\n- Visual Studio 2022 v17.10.x\n\n### Workarounds Tried\n\n- Using Document Outline: works but is not intuitive.\n- Custom designers/overrides: no effect.\n- Runtime logic: not relevant for design-time code.\n\n### Suggested Solution\n\n- Support hit-testing/selecting 'EnableDesignMode' sub-controls by mouse click in the designer.\n- At least provide an option or shortcut to route drop/selection to the correct design surface.\n\n---\n\n**Thank you for considering!**\n\n### .NET version\n\n.NET 9\n\n### Did this work in a previous version of Visual Studio and/or previous .NET release?\n\n.NET Framework 4.8.1\n\n### Issue description\n\nWhen building a custom UserControl that exposes an internal panel with `EnableDesignMode`, it is not possible to select this internal panel by clicking in the designer. All drag-and-drop operations add controls to the root UserControl, not the design-surface-exposed panel, unless the Document Outline is used.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.

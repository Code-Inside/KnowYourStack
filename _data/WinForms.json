The [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/oleidl/nf-oleidl-ioleobject-setclientsite#notes-to-callers) seems to indicate that it is ok to pass `null` pointer so we should investigate what is happening in the windows code and determine next steps to resolve this.\r\n\r\nRepro (could also use other active x controls):\r\n```c#\r\n        using Form form = new();\r\n        using AxSystemMonitor.AxSystemMonitor control = new();\r\n        ((ISupportInitialize)control).BeginInit();\r\n        form.Controls.Add(_control);\r\n        ((ISupportInitialize)_control).EndInit();\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce fixed, we should also update our tests that test ActiveX controls to dispose of them properly.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/10692","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Investigate SetClientSite(null) in AxHost.DisposeAxControl\" (#10692)"},{"Id":"2088244089","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-18T13:32:17","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"10691","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:b9a1a4bb-2302-4987-3b3d-08d8b8050dda)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/arcade\r\n- **Subscription**: b9a1a4bb-2302-4987-3b3d-08d8b8050dda\r\n- **Build**: 20240118.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: January 18, 2024 9:34:40 AM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: c246c9d7bfb98646ec52a18471d075219b26dccc\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Arcade.Sdk**: [from 9.0.0-beta.24066.3 to 9.0.0-beta.24068.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.CMake.Sdk**: [from 9.0.0-beta.24066.3 to 9.0.0-beta.24068.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.GenFacades**: [from 9.0.0-beta.24066.3 to 9.0.0-beta.24068.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.Helix.Sdk**: [from 9.0.0-beta.24066.3 to 9.0.0-beta.24068.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.RemoteExecutor**: [from 9.0.0-beta.24066.3 to 9.0.0-beta.24068.1][1]\r\n  - **Microsoft.DotNet.XUnitExtensions**: [from 9.0.0-beta.24066.3 to 9.0.0-beta.24068.1][1]\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/compare/d5ee27a55e...c246c9d7bf\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (End)\r\n\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (End:b9a1a4bb-2302-4987-3b3d-08d8b8050dda)\r\n\r\n\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/api/codeflow?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/10691)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/10691","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/arcade\" (#10691)"},{"Id":"2087383618","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-18T03:01:23","Actor":"Tanya-Solyanik","Number":"10687","RawContent":null,"Title":"KeysConverter should use CurrentUICulture when converting to name in default context.","State":"open","Body":"KeysConverter in NET8 started converting keys to strings based on the CurrentCulture - https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/blob/f7d6850caa53f62816d977e737d6cb2a537f0d9a/src/System.Windows.Forms/src/System/Windows/Forms/Input/KeysConverter.cs#L332-L354\r\n\r\nHowever, in .NET Framework, we were looking up names based on the CurrentUICulture - https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#System.Windows.Forms/winforms/Managed/System/WinForms/KeysConverter.cs,64 from the resources like this:\r\n\r\nAddKey(SR.**GetString**(SR.toStringPageDown), Keys.Next);\r\n\r\nthis code goes to [ResourceManager.GetString Method (System.Resources) | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.resources.resourcemanager.getstring?view=netframework-4.8.1#system-resources-resourcemanager-getstring(system-string))\r\nand returns\r\n\r\n> The value of the resource localized for the caller's current UI culture, or null if name cannot be found in a resource set.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @cadilhac in https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/10610#issuecomment-1897509534_\r\n            ","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/10687","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"KeysConverter should use CurrentUICulture when converting to name in default context.\" (#10687)"},{"Id":"2087350439","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-01-18T02:24:33","Actor":"Tanya-Solyanik","Number":"10686","RawContent":null,"Title":"Annotate or get rid of the null-forgiving operators in PropertyGrid.cs and related files.","State":"open","Body":"This is a follow up on https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/10110#discussion_r1360819144. \r\n\r\nInvestigate if https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/blob/f7d6850caa53f62816d977e737d6cb2a537f0d9a/src/System.Windows.Forms/src/System/Windows/Forms/Controls/PropertyGrid/PropertyGrid.cs#L3770 can be refactored to convince nullability analyzers that fields that are allocated in this method are not null.

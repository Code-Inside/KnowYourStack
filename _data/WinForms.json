Add `ToolStripButton`-s to a `ToolStrip` and make buttons checkable: set `CheckOnClick` property to true or `CheckState` property to `Checked`\r\n2. Start Narrator and run the app\r\n3. Focus on tool strip, select checked button — Narrator will not announce that it's checked\r\n\r\nSample app: [ToolStripButtonsTest.zip](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/files/11190660/ToolStripButtonsTest.zip)\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\nFor `PropertyGridToolStripButton`, which extends from `ToolStripButton`, Toggle pattern should not be implemented, because it has \"radio button\" control type and cannot be toggled on or off.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/8961","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Screen readers do not announce checked state of ToolStripButton\" (#8961)"},{"Id":"1659092028","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-07T18:51:00","Actor":"sharwell","Number":"8958","RawContent":null,"Title":"Support Xunit.Combinatorial in test code","State":"open","Body":"null\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/api/codeflow?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/8958)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/8958","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Support Xunit.Combinatorial in test code\" (#8958)"},{"Id":"1659018361","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2023-04-07T17:15:43","Actor":"ssflynn77","Number":"8955","RawContent":null,"Title":"Issue/8295 - Added additional unit tests to System.Resources.ResXResourceReader","State":"open","Body":"Fixes #8295 \r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n- Added additional unit tests for System.Resources.ResXResourceReader \r\n  - Constructors\r\n  - GetEnumerator()\r\n  - GetMetaDataEnumerator\r\n\r\n<!-- We are in TELL-MODE the following section must be completed -->\r\n\r\n## Customer Impact\r\n- None\r\n\r\n## Regression? \r\n\r\n- No\r\n\r\n## Risk\r\n\r\n- Low\r\n- PR only has unit tests\r\n\n\n###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://portal.fabricbot.ms/api/codeflow?pullrequest=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/8955)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/8955","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Issue/8295 - Added additional unit tests to System.Resources.ResXResourceReader\" (#8955)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2023-04-13T03:30:34.1586601Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":583}

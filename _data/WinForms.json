As such it could potentially fail in the future should the runtime decide to break the way we were using it.\r\n\r\nOne way to fix this would be to set each of the fields individually on the unboxed ref as the current two types we're optimizing are mutable. I've instead used `StrongBox<T>`. While significantly more complicated, it will not run afoul of the ECMA spec should we get an immutable type we want to handle.\r\n\r\nIf performance here ever ends up being a problem we could go the other way.\r\n\r\nFixes #12933\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/12956)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/12956","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Avoid ECMA spec violation in PropertyStore\" (#12956)"},{"Id":"2853494390","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-14T18:01:25","Actor":"ViktorHofer","Number":"12955","RawContent":null,"Title":"React to NuGet package pruning warnings","State":"closed","Body":"Contributes to https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/46829\r\n\r\nNuGet added a new feature that automatically prunes package and project references that are provided by the shared framework that is targeted.\r\n\r\nResolve the warnings that got emitted when building the repository in non-source-only mode.\r\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/12955)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/12955","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"React to NuGet package pruning warnings\" (#12955)"},{"Id":"2853282278","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2025-02-14T10:26:36","Actor":"LeafShi1","Number":"12954","RawContent":null,"Title":"Port DataGridViewColumnCollectionEditor","State":"open","Body":"Contributes to https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/1115","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/12954","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Port DataGridViewColumnCollectionEditor\" (#12954)"}],"ResultType":"GitHubIssue"}},"RunOn":"2025-02-20T03:30:27.6196579Z","RunDurationInMilliseconds":441}

Open with double-click form\r\n2. In OOP Designer right click on any of the controls\r\n3. Select Properties\r\n4. In Windows Forms output set to Verbose we can observe the attached log entries\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/assets/93762228/69f538af-34a8-432a-b98a-0b3313b12431)\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/assets/93762228/16752ec2-1988-48f0-af82-5432bc111e8a)\r\n\n\n###

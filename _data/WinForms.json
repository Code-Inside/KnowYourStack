This is most notably needed for custom data objects that implement both `System.Runtime.InteropServices.ComTypes.IDataObject` and `System.Windows.Forms.IDataObject` so that we can get the original object back from the IDataObject* on the 'drop' side\r\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/10918)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/10918","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"Refactor DataObject\" (#10918)"},{"Id":"2143538924","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-20T19:56:21","Actor":"AraHaan","Number":"10911","RawContent":null,"Title":"Consider replacing the use of BinaryFormatter at all in WinForms.","State":"closed","Body":"### .NET version\r\n\r\nI will investigate a way to be able to parse the types from Resx without the security issues from BinaryFormatter inside of the winforms codebase in the next few weeks. Because .NET 9 will entirely remove them by default and that I FEEL LIKE being REQUIRED to reference an external nuget package because I set \"Localizable\" to true on a form should not justify a possible security hole in people's applications. That is not acceptable.\r\n\r\n### Did it work in .NET Framework?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### Did it work in any of the earlier releases of .NET Core or .NET 5+?\r\n\r\nYes, but BinaryFormatter was deprecated. Now in .NET 9 it will throw an exception on all of it's APIs, and will have the real code in a nuget package. Although best option here is to look into other means of doing the same thing from within the Windows Forms repository. But first I will write code separate from it to test and then copy paste it all into the Windows Forms codebase to be used internally as an implementation detail.\r\n\r\n### Issue description\r\n\r\nBinaryFormatter should be avoided entirely, I know there are other ways of the same thing, perhaps serialize the types as json instead and store said json strings inside of the resx and deserialize that instead at runtime? Would still need code in the designer for that however to migrate the format of those strings in the resx files to json form but it can be done like that as well. Also System.Text.Json is part of the main shared framework and so it should be no problems depending on it.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n- Create a new winforms project in .NET 8 or 9 Preview SDK (dotnet new winforms)\r\n- open the project in Visual Studio 2022\r\n- set the main form to be \"Localizable\".\r\n- Build and get warnings from each item added to the resx file from the designer itself.","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/10911","RelatedDescription":"Closed issue \"Consider replacing the use of BinaryFormatter at all in WinForms.\" (#10911)"},{"Id":"2143631446","IsPullRequest":false,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-20T19:52:58","Actor":"GCAronChen","Number":"10912","RawContent":null,"Title":"ActiveControl property change To null when control placed in ContainerControl","State":"closed","Body":"### .NET version\r\n\r\n8.0\r\n\r\n### Did it work in .NET Framework?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Did it work in any of the earlier releases of .NET Core or .NET 5+?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Issue description\r\n\r\nWhen placed a control in ActiveMdiChild form, click other control out of current mdi form.\r\n`this.ActiveMdiChild.ActiveControl` will be kept and not change to null.\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/assets/96418485/5ea20a9a-6f5c-44f9-9594-2c58d5fa3111)\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/assets/96418485/c4c08c39-931d-4a26-9335-9d74f2c54798)\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/assets/96418485/6a742303-a815-46a8-b809-ce17d9ceeddb)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut when this control is added in container control, click other control out of current mdi form.\r\n`this.ActiveMdiChild.ActiveControl` will be changed to null.\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/assets/96418485/2caee897-e949-4ea6-a91b-49bd127f68fe)\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/assets/96418485/02bc5ff2-bffe-43b7-94a9-872420122162)\r\n![image](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/assets/96418485/96e4989d-6f5b-4517-adf3-0512e53dda33)\r\n\r\nIs this a bug?\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nUnzip attachment, open \"TestActiveControl.sln\"\r\n\r\n1.

This variable is always false by default, but at any time someone could queue up a run to effectively gather baseline data that can be used to cross-reference failures against what is seen on success._","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/10902","RelatedDescription":"Open issue \"Improve data collection for unit tests\" (#10902)"},{"Id":"2139139871","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-16T18:58:49","Actor":"lonitra","Number":"10901","RawContent":null,"Title":"Bump Nugetpackaging version","State":"closed","Body":"\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/10901)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/10901","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"Bump Nugetpackaging version\" (#10901)"},{"Id":"2139090686","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-16T18:57:12","Actor":"lonitra","Number":"10898","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/6.0] Bump Nuget.Packaging and System.Data.SqlClient Versions","State":"closed","Body":"\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/10898)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/10898","RelatedDescription":"Closed or merged PR \"[release/6.0] Bump Nuget.Packaging and System.Data.SqlClient Versions\" (#10898)"},{"Id":"2139123573","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-16T17:59:28","Actor":"lonitra","Number":"10900","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/8.0] Bump Nugetpackaging version","State":"open","Body":"\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/10900)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/10900","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/8.0] Bump Nugetpackaging version\" (#10900)"},{"Id":"2139106510","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-16T17:52:07","Actor":"lonitra","Number":"10899","RawContent":null,"Title":"[release/7.0] Bump Nuget.Packaging and System.Data.SqlClient Versions","State":"open","Body":"\n ###### Microsoft Reviewers: [Open in CodeFlow](https://microsoft.github.io/open-pr/?codeflow=https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/10899)","Url":"https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/10899","RelatedDescription":"Open PR \"[release/7.0] Bump Nuget.Packaging and System.Data.SqlClient Versions\" (#10899)"},{"Id":"2138584184","IsPullRequest":true,"CreatedAt":"2024-02-16T13:37:35","Actor":"dotnet-maestro[bot]","Number":"10897","RawContent":null,"Title":"[main] Update dependencies from dotnet/runtime","State":"closed","Body":"This pull request updates the following dependencies\r\n\r\n[marker]: <> (Begin:d9f5b309-084f-43b5-02de-08d8b80548e4)\r\n## From https://github.com/dotnet/runtime\r\n- **Subscription**: d9f5b309-084f-43b5-02de-08d8b80548e4\r\n- **Build**: 20240216.1\r\n- **Date Produced**: February 16, 2024 11:00:12 AM UTC\r\n- **Commit**: a3f74163d65fbbd81b9ed946e9d74f080be1dc70\r\n- **Branch**: refs/heads/main\r\n\r\n[DependencyUpdate]: <> (Begin)\r\n\r\n- **Updates**:\r\n  -
